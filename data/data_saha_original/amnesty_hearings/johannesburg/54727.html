<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>DAY 1 - 20-1-1997</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>CHAIRMAN:   We are all aware that Archbishop Tutu, who is the Chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has undergone surgery and is being treated at a clinic in Cape Town.   He is the Chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and in many ways, the spiritual head, if I may put it that way, of the TRC.   On behalf of the members of the Committee and perhaps on behalf of the members of the community at large, I would like to express our hope and wish that he makes a speedy recovery from this illness.   The second point on which I would like to make a comment is that it may not be known to interested parties that representatives of the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee, who are vitally interested in the proceedings, are here and their representatives will be here throughout these hearings.   We have with us this morning Professor Piet Meiring of the R&amp;R Committee and Mr Joe Japhta who will be present throughout the hearing and Mr Tom Umtanta.   The purpose of making this announcement is for applicants, their witnesses, victims, dependents and relatives of victims who are here or who may be here, to be advised that such assistance and counselling as they may require in these difficult matters will be provided by members of the R&amp;R Committee and that as soon as it is possible, either now or during the short adjournment, legal representatives should convey this to their respective clients and witnesses that should they require counselling or assistance, that will be made available and that they themselves make contact with these representatives.   They are here to the left as you will see, Professor Meiring, Mr Japhta and Mr Umtanta.    Thank you.   Mr Mpshe?</p>

Mr Chairman may I just put it on record that the comrade A is a code name, the full names of the person are General Khothatso Christopher Moloi.   He is a General in the South African military.   Mr Chairman he has been served with the form 2 notice and I have been in telephonic contact with him since last year, December, wherein he indicated that he would make himself available.  I have the return of service with me Mr Chairman but I have not seen him as yet in the hearing room.   Thank you Mr Chairman.   He has not arrived.

<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   Mr Coetzee just to recap, you were the Commander of Vlakplaas, Section C1 Unit of the South African Security Police until the end of December 1981, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> The name comrade A, does that name remind you of an incident in which you were involved as a security policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Can you just briefly explain to the Committee how it came that you were involved in an incident which involved this person called comrade A?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chairperson during 1981, towards the second half of 81, I was requested by my officer commanding, Brigadier Willem Schoon, to report at the Regional Security Police offices in Bloemfontein under which Lesotho fell as far as so-called ANC activities and revolutionary activities in Lesotho was concerned.   I did report to Colonel Coetzee, who was then Officer Commanding in the Regional Office where I also met with W/O Hendrik Prinsloo and was briefed to report to the branch office at Ladybrand, near Maseru Bridge, where Captain Louw was in charge for surveillance operation in the Maseru Bridge area on the Lesotho border.  I did proceed to Ladybrand where I reported, and set up base at Van Rooyenshek border gate in a vacant police house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>1a	QUESTION: /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>MR JANSEN	4	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> The Van Rooyenshek border gate, close to which town is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Weppenar in the Free State Mr Chairperson.   In the days whilst I was there at a stage I was called by Captain Louw and a message relayed to me that there was an ANC cadre withe MK name comrade A based in Lesotho and I should put a plan in operation to eliminate him, assassinate him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> During your surveillance work in that area, were you accompanied by other members from Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I was Mr Chairperson, amongst others Almond Nofomela and David Tshikalanga and I can't remember exactly which of the other team members were present.   For the purpose of the operation a Valiant motor car was made available to me and a black police member of the Ladybrand Security Branch was allocated to me to assist Almond Nofomela, whom I chose, to execute the operation.   I issued them with firearms and a Russian hand grenade from the arsenal in the boot of my police vehicle.   The idea was that the member of Ladybrand Security Police who accompanied Almond would point out the house and comrade A, upon which I suggested that they knock at the front door and when he opens, shoot him and throw the hand grenade into the house.  They did proceed to Lesotho and that evening reported back that they shot at comrade A through the window of his house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you accompany them on the mission or did you accompany them only to a certain extent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did not enter Lesotho, I just accompanied them up to the border post where it was left in their hands to execute the operation further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> On arriving at the border gate was it night-time</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>1a	or /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>MR JANSEN	5	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>or approximately what time? </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It is difficult to say.   As far as I remember it was late afternoon, towards evening Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did they return on the same evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> They did return later that night Mr Chairperson and it must have been before 10 o'clock because that's the time when the border posts close at Maseru Bridge where they exited.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did they then report back to you again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> They did report back to me Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you report the incident any further than yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did Mr Chairperson to the Ladybrand, Captain Louw, Branch Commander where he was also personally briefed by or they were de-briefed by him as one of his own personnel was also involved, as I said, as I indicated.   Branch Commander, Security Branch, Ladybrand, Captain Louw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Do you know whether Captain Louw received any instructions for this operation from higher up or from somebody more senior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> In the context of the security operations that I was involved in, all of them, the Regional Office instructions and picking specific targets always came from the Regional Office and was passed on to the Branch Office, but in this specific case, as I say the message was relayed to me as coming from the Regional Office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Whose function was it to identify ANC targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The officer responsible for the ANC desk in this specific country - Lesotho - was at the time W/O Prinsloo, Hendrik Prinsloo, of course in consultation and with the final decision of his Regional Commander who was Colonel</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>1a	Coetzee /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>MR JANSEN	6	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>Coetzee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Can one also assume that somebody like Captain Louw would know that your Unit, Section C1 fell directly under the command of the headquarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He knew that explicitly, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Would it be your practice to report back on missions to your superiors at headquarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is true Mr Chairman and it is also done by the Regional Office itself, but I then de-brief my officer commanding Brigadier Schoon in headquarters upon my return.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Would somebody like Captain Louw have been aware of the fact that you would be reporting back to your superiors at headquarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> 100% Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Was it at all your function at Section C1 to evaluate and identify targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Not at all Mr Chairperson, I didn't work with any files or was involved in any collecting of information as far as the freedom organisations were concerned.   I was on the operational side only.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> How did you then satisfy yourself that your operations had a direct bearing on your work as a security policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well I accepted it in context of the Security Police operational side, with so many people involved I knew that if it was at all any private enterprise it would never could have happened with the people involved at regional level in the Orange Free State, at branch level at Ladybrand and with me reporting back at Security Police Headquarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR ?::</span> (Inaudible, no microphone.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> At regional level, Colonel Coetzee, in</p>

<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Captain Louw at branch level at Ladybrand is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is true Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you at the time regard an operation into a foreign country as being part of the Security Police legitimate work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you at the time regard the elimination of identified enemy targets as being justified police work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson, common practice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Common practice in 1981?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct as far as our operations, secret operations, so-called "secret operations" against the enemy is concerned.   That's correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>MR JANSEN (contd)</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> In exile you were told something more about the identity of this person called comrade A, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What were you told?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That the name of the person and as I say I haven't, I didn't see the exact spelling of it, it was just mentioned to me something in the line of... (impossible to transcribe)... or something like that, I can't pronounce it.  So the spelling in my manuscript is on hearing the name only, not seeing it how it's spelt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR JANSEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Coetzee, in the manuscript on page 90 is stated that, and this you also repeated in your evidence,</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>1a	this /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>MR MPSHE	8	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>this paragraph 5.4, page 90, book 1, paragraph 5.4.11.3.7 this you also confirmed in your evidence that the specific instructions you gave to them was that they should knock at the door and when he opens, they must fire and throw a hand grenade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> It would seem from the manuscript and your evidence that they did not do that, instead they shot him through the window?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did they explain to you as to why they did not carry out the instructions as given to them by yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> If I could remember correctly that when they knocked, comrade A did not want to open the door, if I understand the question correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> They reported to you that they shot at him through the window, did they explain to you or report to you the extent of the injuries, whether they did shoot him at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I can't remember whether they were 100% sure whether they did in fact, whether he was caught in the firing, they believed that there was a possibility that they did hit him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> What did you report to Schoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Exactly the order that I received Mr Chairperson and what happened and what was reported back to me by the team after the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Did you say it was a successful operation or what did you report in that connection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I couldn't explain in detail as I say, it was not</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>1a	my /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>MR DE JAGER	9	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>my duty to do the after assessment of the success of the operation afterwards, that would have come from the Ladybrand branch office through the Free State/Bloemfontein Regional Office to headquarters, a full report on the final result and outcome of the operation.   The name was of no meaning to me at all and I've never met or seen the target Mr Chairperson....an ANC operative with the code name "comrade A".</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>QUESTIONS BEING ASKED - SPEAKER HAS NO MICROPHONE</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> What reason did you have to assume that the instructions that were given to you were reliable that the person who was about to be attacked was indeed an ANC activist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well Mr Chairperson, in strict theory it could have been possible that it was not, but because of the number of officers and persons involved and my reporting back in context in the job that I was employed and the experience that I had, it was impossible to execute an individual, a private operation of that magnitude into a foreign country, with the risks attached to it, being caught amongst other things without the necessary knowledge and back-up from as high up as Security Police headquarters.  There is examples in my operations where this in fact happened, if for instance I could remind the Commission of the abduction of Joe Pillay(?) where action was immediately taken two days after the incident and in fact even on the Sunday from Department of Foreign Affairs level and from General Johan Coetzee who was then the Regional, the headquarters security commander in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER(?)::</span> Sorry Mr Coetzee, I can't understand.   You are in charge of this whole operation, you've been</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>1a	brought /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>MEMBER OF PANEL	10	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>brought down from Pretoria to Ladybrand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> You went back to Pretoria and you can't report whether this operation was successful or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well I can report that the shooting did took place and as I say, the postmortem of the operation is then done as I did not collect any information on the target or assess the target, in the same way it was not my job to assess the result of the specific operation.   That was done by the branch office and feedback was given through the regional office to security police headquarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> But you instructed him to throw a grenade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Did you enquire whether he did so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did and it was not thrown Mr Chairperson, the circumstances apparently was not favourable as we planned.  As I say, I can only give them a broad outline of the operation, but eventually it is left in their hands on the scene according to circumstances awaiting them on the scene to decide whether they could execute the whole instruction or just part of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> So in fact you reported back that the grenade wasn't thrown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> In your memoirs on page 19 why do you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>"I do not remember whether they said anything about throwing the hand grenade into the house."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did say so at the time Mr Chairperson, this was in 1989/1990 when I have written this document.  I left the country without any notes, I had to rely on memory only and since then during the Harms Commissions and all the other</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>1a	inquiries /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>MEMBER OF PANEL	11	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>inquiries, documents were submitted and I of course had the opportunity to speak to Almond and Tshikalanga and I've learned that they did not throw the hand grenade.   I was not sure at the time when I left the country, as I said I had to rely on memory only.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Tjekelanga didn't accompany did he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No but he would have been able to tell me what Nofomela said, I can't remember which one exactly but Almond for sure.   Tjekelanga was with me on the border but did not go on this specific operation with Nofomela.(End of side 1a)</p>

<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> In 1981 you were employed as a constable in the South African Police Force under the command of Captain Dirk Coetzee at Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Towards the end of 1981 you were at the Wepener border gate near Lesotho when you were called to Ladybrand, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Who briefed you at Ladybrand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> It was Captain Dirk Coetzee an Warrant Officer Prinsloo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Can you tell the Commission about the instructions that you received?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> What I remember, Sir, is that he said that there was someone in Lesotho.  I cannot remember the name he gave, but he is a member of the ANC and it is someone who should be killed and I was with Jantjies from Ladybrand Special Branch.  He gave me a 9mm weapon, I cannot remember whether it was a 7.65 or what, but it was a 9mm and Jantjies was also given a firearm.  I cannot remember the hand grenade.  I cannot remember, although he mentioned something about a hand grenade.  We were to go to Lesotho and when we got there we were to kill this person, whose name I cannot remember, but when they mentioned Comrade A it sounds familiar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> How would you identify this person once you reach Lesotho?</p>

<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>MR MARAIS	13	MR NOFOMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Chairperson, in a certain way the way Jantjies understood instructions was he knew the person and he knew where the person lived because we had no problem getting there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> At what time did you go through the border gate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> It was in the evening when we went through the border gates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Can you tell the Committee what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> We were in a blue Valiant, which I had brought from Vlakplaas, myself and David Chikalanga.  We used the Maseru border gates, myself and Jantjies, and we went through the Maseru border gates and we went to this place.  It was dark by then, it was late evening, and we went there carrying these firearms.  We jumped over the fence.  We entered the premises from the backyard and if I remember correctly it was L-shaped and there was a door which we were supposed to knock at and Jantjies was walking in front and I was walking behind him.  When we came near this door he said, "There he is sitting at the table".  There was a big window in front of us and when he finished saying that he started firing immediately.  I was behind him and I couldn't shoot from behind him, I had to get next to him in order to shoot.  When he finished shooting and he turned around I started firing as well in the direction in which he was firing although I didn't see anyone any longer.  And we then ran back to the vehicle and we passed through the border gates again.  It was closing by the time we went through. When we got back we reported back to Captain Dirk Coetzee.  And I cannot remember who he was with when we came back from the border, and that is what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Why did you not follow the instructions to knock</p>

<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>MR MARAIS	14	MR NOFOMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>at the door and then shoot the person who opened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Sir, the way in which this whole thing happened is that we were supposed to get there and go to the door and Jantjies had already spotted him before we got to the door and he started firing.  When I asked him thereafter why we didn't knock he said that it was possible that there were other people besides him inside because when we got there and he was saying, "There he is", there were people sitting next to him at the table.  So when I asked him why we did not knock, I asked him when we had left already, he said no, it was possible that there were other people there who - we could endanger ourselves that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> How many shots did you fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I remember myself firing once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And when did you fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I was firing at the window that Jantjies was shooting at.  He shot several times.  I cannot remember how many times, but he shot about two or three, he fired about two or three bullets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Do you know whether anybody was injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> At the time we were shooting, I did not see anyone who was injured or anything, but Jantjies said that he had struck him.  But thereafter he says that we didn't do anything to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> How did you get through the border gates with the firearms in your possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Jantjies was well-known at those border gates at Maseru and going with him through those border gates was a great advantage because the two of us went through and we weren't asked any questions, nobody bothered us and even coming back I was with him and on our way back they were</p>

<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Was this type of operation to go into a foreign country and assassinate a person part of your duties at Vlakplaas?</p>

<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> On that mission that you were involved in into countries like Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho, was explosives taken on some of those missions?  Could you say whether it was taken as a general rule or not?</p>

<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Gentlemen, I trust that the time that was afforded to you to discuss amongst yourselves how the need for the leading of certain evidence may be curtailed has been achieved and, if so, I think we should place that on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman and members of the Committee.  Firstly, we are indebted to the Committee's indulgence in allowing us the time to look into our papers.  We have identified matters wherein the confirmation will be done as agreed in chambers, and they are as follows, and this will be in the Dirk Coetzee application only.  I just mention the numbers.  That will be matter No 7, No 8, No 12 and matter No 1.  We have included matter No 11, but this we are keeping in abeyance pending information I have been promised by the Investigative Unit this afternoon.  If I do not get the information this afternoon then matter No 11 will also be included under those where evidence is not going to be led.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>	Then in Nofomela's application they are as follows:  matter No 5, No 6,  No 8, No 9, No 11, No 12, 13 and 15.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>Mr Chairman, those are the matters.  I want my colleagues to confirm that before I proceed. </p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> I confirm that, Mr Chairman.  I just wish to add that my learned friend Mr Mpshe also told me that he was awaiting instructions on matter No 2 in Mr Coetzee's application, the matter of Dhlamini and Mavuso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Mpshe, did I understand you to mention as far as Mr Nofomela is concerned, matter No 11?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And that matter No 11 as far as Dirk Coetzee is</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>20.1 - 1B	concerned/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>18</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>concerned is not mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, there are matters wherein Mr Nofomela is alone where Mr Dirk Coetzee and others are not involved, hence the applications are separated, separately bound.  So the numbering is not a continuation of the other matters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I beg your pardon.   Is it proposed then to place on record the relevant paragraphs of the applications for amnesty or the contents of those paragraphs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Mr Chairman, yes.  As far as I understood from my learned friend we would be dealing with those matters where we are going to lead evidence first, and then when we get to that point where we will start just leading brief confirmatory evidence, that we will then place that on record.  I can do so at this stage already, because I have the notes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>	Mr Chairman, as far as incident No 1 is concerned in Mr Coetzee's application, the bombing in Manzini, it is found in the manuscript, Evidence Book No 1, at paragraph 5.4.14.1 on page 95 of the manuscript.  And as far as No 7 is concerned, that is found, the Swazi detainee, that is found on paragraph 5.4.10.2, of the manuscript, page 87, and I think it is page 17 of the numbered pages of the paginated papers of the present application. </p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Matter No 6?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> That was the matter we just led evidence about, the Comrade A matter.  Then matter No 8 is found in the manuscript at page 94, paragraph 5.4.12.2, and matter No 12, the Manzini Post Office bomb, page 54 of the manuscript, paragraph 5.2.6.8.</p>

<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>19</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> It is paragraph 12 - it is on the typed pages 23, I would imagine on the paginated papers to be 27.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>	Then the two matters in which we are awaiting instructions, that may possibly be dealt with in this manner, is matter No 2 in the application Peter Dhlamini and Selby Mavuso, that is found in the manuscript on page 108, paragraph 5.4.16.1.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> (Inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Yes, and then the application page is typed page 3 of the Annexure, then page 7 of the paginated papers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> (Inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> It is typed page 15, in other words paginated page 19.  And then finally matter No 11, which is in the manuscript on page 103 paragraph 5.4.14.4.  In the application it is typed page 21 of the Annexure and therefore page 25 of the paginated papers.  So those are the issues that will be dealt with by way of confirmatory evidence.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Mr Chairman, the situation with regard to the applicant, Mr Nofomela, is correct as stated by my learned friend, Mr Mpshe.  I am not in possession of this manuscript that is being referred to.  Apparently that was compiled before the application for Mr Nofomela was received by the Commission therefore his application is not contained in it.  But the paragraphs referred to by my learned friend all appear in the Annexure annexed to the affidavit by Mr Nofomela.</p>

<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman and members, just to clarify the question of affidavits.  Further submissions were submitted and the affidavits counsel is referring to are not included in the application.  These are further submissions that were sent which are going to be given to the Committee members when the compilation is completed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So we haven't seen them, you haven't got them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Definitely they are not there.  Mr Chairman, if that is agreed upon, we further agreed that we start with matter No 9 in the Dirk Coetzee application on page 21, paginated page 21, because the victim is present at this moment.  We felt we could dispose of this while she is available.  This has been agreed upon.</p>

<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> At what stage will you be calling the witness to confirm the contents of the manuscript?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> Mr Chairman at any particular stage, whatever is most appropriate, it's just that it would need some introductory evidence to explain the origins of the manuscript and the circumstances that was written under and then how it relates to the application itself, to the extent if there are any differences how those came about.   So I would think it could then be appropriately be done at any stage after the present matter we're going to deal with.</p>

<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chairman I received instructions from Brigadier Schoon, Section C, to go to Kopfontein hek border post to a nearby farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Was that farm known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was not personally known to me, it was the base from where the Vlakplaas group that operated in the Western Transvaal under Captain Koos Vermeulen, who worked under me, operated from, very near to Kopfontein hek border gate, a kilometre or three away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> How do you spell the name of this place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chairman no, it was a friendly farmer, it was on the first, it's fairly a straight road coming from Botswana through to South Africa, the road makes, after a kilometre or three, a turn towards Zeerust and on that turn is a high ridge on your left-hand side of the road running across I would say the direction in which you are travelling, that road is travelling.   I know in the 1981's there was a shoot-out between freedom fighters and the police in this ridge right behind the farmer's house, but I can specifically go and point out this farm, I will still get it, it is as I say it was used as a permanent base by one of my groups, the Western Transvaal group, led by Captain Koos Vermeulen.   The border gate into Botswana at that point is called Kopfontein border gate.</p>

<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I proceeded to the border accompanied by Paul Van Dyk, Tshikalanga, David Tsekelanga and at the time I mentioned also the name of Almond Nofomela, where I met up</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>2a	with /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>MR JANSEN	23	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>with Captain Rudy Kraus of Zeerust security branch, under which security branch the area of Gaberone fell as far as ANC collecting of information and the electing of targets in the area is concerned.   I also met up with Captain Jan Coetzee, the officer who took over from me at Vlakplaas, but at that stage was still with West Rand Security based at Krugersdorp under the Regional Office of West Rand.   The Zeerust Security Office was under the Western Transvaal Regional Office which is Potchefstroom.   With them was Joe Mamasela and Koos Vermeulen was on the farm.   At the farm the target house was explained the exact place where this house was in Gaberone, was detailed to us by Captain Jan Coetzee and Rudy Kraus and also a layout of the house, a plan of the house where each bedroom is and where Rola apparently slept.   In the south-eastern corner was a bedroom where he slept and it was also told to us that if a bakkie, a 1 400 Datsun bakkie was parked in front of the house or next to the house, then Rola would be home.   I then first sent Almond Nofomela and Joe Mamasela in with a police bakkie, a Cortina 3 litre bakkie, with false registration plates which I thought at the time.   They went for a reconnaissance during the daytime, in the afternoon of 26 November 1981.   When they returned I then went in to do a reconnaissance of the area and the house and came back to the farm.   At 7:45 that night, the border post closes at 8 o'clock, Koos, I instructed Joe Mamasela to take the bakkie through the border gate into Botswana and drive to Gaberone, coming back at about 9 o'clock to pick us up, after the rest of the team would have crossed over the border fence.   The team consisted of myself, Captain Koos Vermeulen, W/O Paul Van Dyk, Captain Rudy Kraus and Captain Jan Coetzee as well</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>2a	as /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>MR JANSEN	24	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>as Joe, Almond Nofomela and David Tshikalanga.   Joe was already in at that stage then.   We crossed the fence as discussed and at 9 o'clock that evening, Joe came back and picked us up.   At the point where he picked us up, Captain Rudy Kraus and Captain Jan Coetzee stayed behind as markers so that we could coming back flashing our lights they would get into the road and show us the way where we could branch off to the right of the border post coming from Botswana to South Africa and cut the fence and get back into South Africa through the cut border fence.   As we entered into Gaberone, I left Paul Van Dyk and David Tsekelanga with the bakkie about one and half street blocks away under a tree, from the target house, whilst Koos Vermeulen and myself with Almond Nofomela and Joe Mamasela proceeded to the house on the corner, right next to the target house.   At that stage, right in front of the target house was a disco or a party going and there was a lot of people in the street and the dogs at the corner house were barking at us and I then saw that a storm was building up and decided to wait for the storm to break and use that as a cover for after the people have been chased into the house and the dogs into the kennels by the rain.   This happened round about midnight when thunder and lightening broke out and heavy rains.   There was a power failure in the area in the town and we got up and walked down the street into the front gate, past the bakkie which was parked at the back of the little verandah at the back of the house.   I've asked Koos Vermeulen to take position at the south-eastern window of the bedroom and fire towards the street, away from us, whilst we would go into the house and fire in the other direction.  As we were still discussing of how to, how next would we break the door</p>

<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>MR JANSEN	25	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>down now two women entered the kitchen with a lit candle and opened the back door.   Joe grabbed one of the women and closed her mouth and shot at her at point blank.   I heard someone drop to the cement like a bag of bones and the other woman turned and ran into the house.   Shots were fired at her in, and at a stage I pushed Almond and Joe Mamasela aside, entered the house and shot with a sub-machine gun, a HMK with which Koos Vermeulen also had one issued, with a silencer on and a canvas bag to pick up, to pick up the empty shells that they don't drop on the scene.   With that I then fired.   Koos Vermeulen was also instructed to hurl a hand grenade through the bedroom window and after the shooting then we started running towards the back fence of the house, past Koos Vermeulen and at that stage he didn't fire one shot as yet.   I don't know whether he then did a small, a few rounds on the room but for sure he did not throw the hand grenade.   We got over the back fence into the street, into the street at the back of the house, ran to the bakkie and left for Kopfontein border gate whilst it was heavily raining.   I should just mention also that Joe Mamasela and Almond Nofomela was armed with a Tokarev and a Makarov, if I remember right, respectively.   Approaching the border gate, flashing the lights, Rudy and Kraus and Jan Coetzee came out of the veld, stopped us, we branched off to the right of the road and eventually found our way through the mud and whatever, cutting the border fences, three of them, there were three - the main border and then on each side of that specific borderline was also a smaller fence.  Cut the three and went back to the farm where we re-grouped.  Joe Mamasela was sure that the woman he shot was Joyce Dibali and it was that she was dead.   My conclusion would</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>2a	be /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>MR JANSEN	26	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>be after reading evidence in the end, a statement by Mrs Dibali that she was actually the one who ran into the house and that the one that collapsed on the cement on the back verandah must have fainted or something, or emulated a fainting, and that is why I was so sure that she was shot, because Joe was so sure.   It later proved that Mrs Dibali ended up with three wounds, I don't know whether it was actual bullet wounds or shrapnel wounds and I don't know exactly what the injuries was of the woman that fell on the back verandah which was held in Joe's arms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> The statement that you refer to, which to some extent disagrees with your manuscript, is that the statement that was handed in at the Harms Commission by Ms Dibali which she had made more or less at the time of the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was after I testified in London and the incident wasn't(?) denied at all and then at a later stage one of the advocates appearing for one of the parties, Advocate Paul Pretorius, uncovered these documents from the Botswana police and handed it in, which in fact proved what I told about our entering Botswana was true and in which statement Mrs Dibali confirmed that she recognised Joe Mamasela as one of the guys being present.   I first saw it of course recently when it, when we prepared for this specific case but when I was testifying in April at the Harms Commission, it was as yet not handed in at the Commission as evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> Mr Chairman I have a Bundle of documents which emanate from the Harms Commission which relate to the Dibali incident.   My Annexures at this stage go up until F, so this would I imagine be G.   Mr Chairman you would note that there is firstly a, there are some documents which briefly</p>

<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>explain to the Harms Commission what was known about the incident at the time and that is followed by certain documents which is a medical examination of Ms Dibali, a registration document of a vehicle and then certain border crossing documentation of the Republic of Botswana and those documents are then followed by the statement, the actual statement of Ms Dibali.   If we could then HAND THIS UP as EXHIBIT G.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> These shall go in as Exhibit G.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> It comprises some 30 pages Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Coetzee did you then return to South Africa that same evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> We did Mr Chairman, past 12 the next morning of the 27th, it must have been around about if I would guess 12:30, 1 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you report on the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did do my brief, my de-briefing and as I said the full report eventually then came through Zeerust Security Branch, Captain Rudy Kraus and Jan Coetzee of West Rand Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Who did you do your de-briefing to?</p>

<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> The full report was made to who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It goes through the branch office, Rudy Kraus at Zeerust, the regional office or branch office at West Rand where Captain Jan Coetzee worked, through the regional office in Krugersdorp and of course Rudy Kraus through his regional office in Potchefstroom would have compiled a report which then eventually went in detail to headquarters after all the facts, the so-called results of the operation</p>

<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Is it correct to say that the pattern that it followed as far as orders and briefings and branch involvement was concerned that it was the same as in most other across border raids?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Just to repeat again, was the assassination of ANC people in other countries, did you regard that as part of the work of the South African Security Police?</p>

<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What information and instructions did you give to Mr Nofomela about this mission into Botswana before you went into Botswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That he in person, together with Joe Mamasela will accompany me to the back door of the house from where we will then burst into the house and that he should shoot anyone in sight inside the house who would come, we would come upon or that would come onto us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you tell him what the purpose of the mission was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes I said to eliminate ANC cadres who operated from Botswana, from Botswana soil against the Government of</p>

<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you instruct him to comply with your instructions as part of his duties as a policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's 100% correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> That was also the situation in all incidents where you instructed him to carry out your orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Do you know anything of the abduction of Mr Muhabe Dibali that preceded this raid into Botswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chairman during my time in exile I could not remember it at all, apart from the fact that Captain Koos Vermeulen one afternoon picked up a hitchhiker on the road towards Zeerust which eventually proved to be an ANC cadre.  As a result of that shooting, as a result of that pick-up a shooting ensued a day or two thereafter in this ridge behind the farmhouse where Koos Vermeulen was staying.  The Dibali, that it was this specific Dibali I don't know, did not know anything about it.   There was also allegations about a Dibali being abducted from Soweto by Almond and Joe Mamasela.   I could not remember that in exile after being reminded about it when, amongst my return I just could remember the fact that during an abduction in Soweto Almond's private car - a Mazda - was used and because the registration number was taken by witnesses on the scene and the police eventually got to the registering address where the vehicle was arrested, at his mother's place I think, we then decided to hide the vehicle.   That I only could remember afterwards but I did not tie that specific incident up with the Botswana raid, well even up to now I can't remember ever seeing this Dibali person that was abducted.</p>

<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Coetzee before leaving for Botswana or Gaberone, were you given a description of the targets Joyce Dibali and the husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No I was not, for that purpose Joe Mamasela accompanied us because he apparently visited that house whilst infiltrating with the ANC and Joyce and Rola, her husband, was known to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> So this woman who was grabbed by Joe Mamasela and shot at close range, would I be correct to state that it was not Joyce Dibali?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I would not be able to say, it proves to be that at this moment after reading Mrs Dibali's statement, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Perhaps I'll put this question to Joe Mamasela if the occasion arises but would you know the reason why he had to kill an innocent woman who was not Joyce Dibali if he knew her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I think one, when sort of going to the house you</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>2a	expect /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>MR MPSHE	31	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>expect mainly to go for two targets who is living in that house, Joyce and Rola Dibali.   There is of course always a possibility of other people being in the house too which as proved in the past and other incidents unfortunately their lives were also then sort of not saved, it's decisions that had to be taken on the spur of the moment and it was difficult to select targets at night where you were in a hurry to just kill and get away safely out of that neighbouring country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Yes, but I think it was difficult for Joe Mamasela to know that the woman he shot at close range was not Joyce Dibali because he knew her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I suppose it should have as Joyce was very, very well-known to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Do you then agree with me further that if that is the case that this woman was just an innocent person, this woman had nothing to do with the political motivation the applicants referred to or you refer to here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I would not be able to tell at all whether she was in transit in the house, whether she was a member of the ANC, what her role was and why she was sleeping in that house that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Yes.   You told us in evidence that the specific instruction you gave to Mamasela and others is that they must enter the house and shoot at anyone they find in the house.   Did I quote you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is true Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> How do you reconcile this with your evidence again that you went there and the instruction for you and for your guys was to kill ANC cadres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well as you would enter that house I'm sure the</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>2a	other /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>MR MPSHE	32	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>other ANC cadres that would be in that house, as it was apparently used for that purpose as transit and house ANC cadres, other ANC cadres, it would be very difficult to say only concentrate on two targets while there might be three other ANC cadres in the house, armed to the teeth and you get shot in the back.   So unfortunately in an operation of that kind it's very difficult to say take that target and don't touch that one.   So the easiest way is shoot at sight anybody in that house that would approach you or you would come upon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Even if that person is not an ANC cadre, you just have to shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well as I say, the idea or what was going through my head and what was explained to me what the house was used for, anyone in that house would 99% sure be connected with the African National Congress and involved in ANC activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You testified that these two women who were, you saw them as they were entering the house, am I correct and a candle was lit inside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> They were on their way out from the bedroom part of the house coming into the kitchen with a lit candle on their way out to the bakkie that was parked outside I presume.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Would you perhaps remember who had the lit candle between the two women, between Joyce Dibali and the other woman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I up to this day don't know Mrs Joyce Dibali or the other woman, I would not be able to recognise one of them, their faces.</p>

<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> With kitchen curtains and rain pouring down and the small little verandah where we three didn't even fit into next one another, I did not have the time to do identification.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> So all what you saw were two figures moving inside?</p>

<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> ...instructions to you was to go and kill people who lived in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Ja I think I was specifically referring to Joyce and Rola.   Can Mr Chairman just please refer me to this page.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Page 90 I suppose of your manuscript.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> "Occupants of an ANC house in Gaberone", I think uppermost in my mind was the names of Joyce and Rola Dibali, but except as I say always that anyone present in the house could be armed, the house was used for ANC purposes and you can be shot if you start identifying targets it takes a long time, specific persons in the house and to separate them from other people in the house, you could end up dead because the house was used for ANC activities.</p>

<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The instruction at headquarters was to proceed, by Brigadier Schoon, to proceed to the farm near Kopfontein where I will be briefed on this specific issue by Captain Jan Coetzee and Captain Rudy Krause.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> That's the briefing I'm talking about, what was the briefing, was the briefing that you kill occupants of a house or was the briefing that you kill Joyce Dibali and Rola?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well the main targets as I said was Joyce and Rola Dibali, that was the main target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> What is it that is not the main target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well that was the purpose we entered for and I mean if you found any other people in that house it was not for me to decide to wait or to leave, it was to accept that they were then also ANC involved and to shoot first and ask questions later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Do you remember exactly what the nature of your instructions were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No Mr Chairman except, apart from that the main targets were Joyce and Rola Dibali.   I don't think that the briefers could say at the time that there would be more than that, than only those two people in the house at the time.  I think what they should have said is that there was a great</p>

<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>possibility that there would be more than just this two people in the house and explained it further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> So you were approaching the house with this idea that you were going to kill whoever was going to be found in the house or were you in fact targeting specific people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Targeting specific people, Joyce and Rola Dibali and of course any one else you might bump into in the house that would be, unexpectedly be in the house at the time of the raid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> The lights went dead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No there was a power failure in the town, there was no streets lights and no lights in the house at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Visibility must have been poor obviously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was poor, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> And these people were relying on a candle light in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Why didn't you call off the mission in the light of the fact that there was a real danger that you might mis-identify your targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> There was never a possibility to call off the mission, whoever was in that house was accepted as being targeted because of being involved with the ANC for which purposes that house was used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Well then it didn't matter whether there was light or no light, in any case whoever was in there would have been shot dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> If they would have obstructed us or came in our way, that's correct Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> If they came in the way of the main target yes Mr Chairman, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> If they didn't?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well if they ducked under the beds I'm sure we wouldn't have (indistinct) them, although there was incidents later on, not where I was involved in, where it happened that even the children in the house was taken out and in a specific case in  Swaziland a 10 year old child of the target Mowi(?) Nkosi, he was not in the house because it was again said if the Valiant is parked outside my brief was he's in the house, I did not know of anyone else, I was not told that there was anyone else in the house.   I blew up the house, he was not there he went out with friends apparently, and his 10 year old child got killed as a result.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Well Captain in terms of your manuscript, for them to be killed they don't have to be in your way, all they have to do is be in the house because in terms of the instructions as per the manuscript, your instructions was to kill occupants of the house and that includes people who would have been kneeling under the bed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chairman yes, my target was Joyce and Rola Dibali, I wouldn't have gone searching in that house, me myself at that stage, for any other persons.   The house was a well-known ANC safe-house, it was apparently a well-known ANC transit house, used by the ANC in those days and I'm sure they would be able to confirm whether that was true or not Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well Mr Chairman, the target was Joyce and Rola Dibali and if anyone else in the house came in the way, they would have been victims too, unfortunately yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> This business about if anybody else came in the way are just words you are using.   You went there to kill Joyce and Rola Dibali and whoever else was in the house, whether they got in the way or not.   Is that not what you really did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Can Mr Chairman just complete please, I couldn't...</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Although your instructions were to eliminate the Dibali's, what you did was to eliminate whoever else was found in the house, whether they got in the way or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chairman as I already said, the main targets were Joyce and Rola Dibali, unfortunately in an incident like that anyone else in the house that came in the way and as a result of the power failure and no lights there, I'm sure that everyone in the house would just have been shot at random, that's correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> You didn't know Joyce and Rola Dibali did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did not know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> So you would not have been able to say whether you were shooting at them or not, you would have shot anyone in the house wouldn't you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Mr Coetzee we know that Rola wasn't there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> To us Mr Chairman it was explained as I said, if the bakkie is parked next to the house, which it was, then he was in the house.   That was our brief, that was the information we got.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> But in fact he wasn't there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I believe so afterwards yes, I understand that he wasn't there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> In fact another woman was mistakenly identified as Joyce by Mamasela?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I can't say what went through his mind when the two women exited the house.   According to what I can remember, Joyce was the woman he shot at point blank, he claimed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Yes he claimed but it proved afterwards not to be the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It proved not to be the case, that is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> So he shot another woman instead of Joyce and he was the one to identify Joyce?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct, the other woman that ran back into the house was also shot at which eventually then proved to be Joyce Dibali according to the statement that was handed up to the, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> She had only light shrapnel wounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes it's not clear in that statement, bullet wounds are being talking of in the thigh and upper leg, they went to the hospital, the wounds were treated, they were sent back and had to come back the next day so I accept that the specific naming of "bullet wounds" must have been</p>

<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Was Joe Mamasela actually sent to Bophutatswana and did he stay in this very house during his briefing or infiltrating the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chairman at the time Joe was still a very sensitive, identified source from the outside, working specifically with Captain Jan Coetzee of Westrand Security Branch, whom together with Major Kruger recruited Joe whilst being a waiting trial prisoner in a criminal case in the Krugersdorp prison in late 1979, I think July.   At that stage Joe was still working closely, he only came to Vlakplaas together with Captain Jan Coetzee permanently in February 1982, two months after I've left the farm and Captain Jan Coetzee took over the farm as Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> In your manuscript paragraph 5.4.12.1.5 you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>"Captain Jan Coetzee from Westrand Security Branch in Krugersdorp handled Joe Mamasela who used to live in the target house of this mission whilst undergoing ANC crash-course training."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct, that I knew in brief, very in brief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Well that's what I've been asking you, wasn't this the very house that he received training in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes it must have been, I don't have first-hand knowledge thereof but as I say I'd heard that he, that was the house where he was infiltrated and he stayed there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Yes but now you answered and said yes but he was still due to receive training, he was only a youngster brought in then and according to this he'd already completed</p>

<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> What I actually want to say Mr Chairman, he was not with me at Vlakplaas, I didn't have first-hand knowledge of his collection of information of his details of his training, only that he did stay in that house while undergoing training and whilst he was still under the wing of Captain Jan Coetzee and Westrand Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> But you go on to say immediately after the passage my brother has just read to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a>"Joe did of course, during my time, join us at Vlakplaas when not needed by Jan Coetzee."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct, when Jan Coetzee couldn't use him he worked with specifically, more specifically with the Western Transvaal group, Captain Koos Vermeulen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> At Vlakplaas, that's what you say, read it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I can see it Mr Chairman please bear with me, as I said this manuscript was written in exile, it was written on memory only, if word selection as such is he was not based on the farm, he was based with West Rand Security Branch, he was paid by West Rand Security Branch and when not needed there he would operate with the Western Transvaal group, mainly in Western Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> Mr Chairman if I could possibly just come in here, there seems to be a slight misunderstanding.   Mr Coetzee you refer to the "Western Transvaal group" and Captain Vermeulen, could you just explain how that relates to Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well Vlakplaas was, there was four groups on Vlakplaas.   One mainly under Koos Vermeulen, Captain Koos Vermeulen worked Western Transvaal, from the farm as base near Kopfontein gate.   That was because Koos Vermeulen grew</p>

<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>MEMBER OF COMMISSION	41	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a>up in Botswana, he spoke Tswana fluently and all of the askaris and people that worked with him was people that were clued up with the Botswana set-up of the African National Congress.   Then there was another group under W/O Paul Van Dyk who was mainly Eastern Transvaal, because he worked Swaziland for quite few years, I think five years and mostly people, ANC cadres or askaris who infiltrated and knew the Swaziland set-up very well.   In the same way I operated in another region and there was a fourth group, so when talking about Koos Vermeulen was working from his base, when not needed as a whole party, as a whole Vlakplaas group in one specific area like for instance in November 1981 with the Mningi killings in Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> Is it correct to say that when you refer to Vermeulen and his Western Transvaal group, you're not referring to anything that structurally has something to do with Rudy Kraus' Western Transvaal branch or region?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Not structurally, he would communicate as a headquarters member from Vlakplaas closely with the local Security Branch in Zeerust.</p>

<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Captain you had a reconnaissance trip to the target house on that day?</p>

<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> On that day in question you had a reconnaissance trip to Mr and Mrs Dibali's house?</p>

<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No, nothing at all that I can remember of, it was basically just to get clued up with the area and the exact location of the house during daytime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Did you not get a report from Mr Mamasela about the movements at the targeted house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It is possible that they could have said for instance that there was a bakkie parked, that the bakkie was parked outside or that someone entered the house, that is quite possible.   Nothing specific that I can remember Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> You knew that you were dealing with a married couple, were you advised whether there were children?</p>

<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Did you know whether they were staying with elderly people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No I was not advised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Did you not think it reasonable on your part as the leader of the operation to take reasonable measures to ensure that only the identified targets, being Mr and Mrs Dibali, were attacked and no one else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chairman it's very, very difficult to, and I'm not referring to anyone of the Chairpersons, with hindsight or with hindsight it is easy, but I can assure you Mr Chairman it's a nerve-wracking experience to go into another country with such an instruction, with the knowledge always in the back of your head that you might be caught or picked up by the local police or army, and as I say under the circumstances the first thing in your head is to get the operation over and get away.   There's actually no real time for going, sort of in a clean way, clean way selecting and so it is hastily hit and run operation.</p>

<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is not because of being in a black suburb we would have stood out like sore fingers as white persons, we did then black our faces with make-up, had balaclavas on to cover our ears and hair, long-sleeved shirts and our hands were also blackened.   We kept a low profile in the grass next to the corner house whilst Joe and Almond paraded up and down on the sidewalk.</p>

<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> You still thought it more prudent to blacken your face?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct because of street lights and, in the area of the house Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Was there any urgency in you having to carry out your instructions on that particular day, without having taken the reasonable caution in ensuring that only the identified targets would be dealt with by your members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> As I say Mr Chairman, it's very difficult to wait until a specific target is in the house alone because your information, as I could pick up through the relevant branches, would be always a few days or a week old so you would always operate, because there was not a fax or phone line open between your source and that branch, you would not know what was going on at that specific time of night, and just have to operate on week old evidence or of that kind,</p>

As a result with that he had close ties with the, with the ANC's activities in Swaziland but the main handlers of that area was the Security Branch, Zeerust, Captain Rudy Kraus.</p>

<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> What was Captain Coetzee's function for purposes of that operation, you say he was "handling" Mr Mamasela, was there a need for him to accompany Mr Mamasela to Botswana to handle him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well it wasn't for me to decide Mr Chairman, as I say his involvement was as a result of Joe Mamasela's involvement and his infiltration with the ANC in Botswana and him as Jan Coetzee being his handler, bringing him with Joe Mamasela to link up with Rudy Kraus of Zeerust Security Branch and we of Section C, Headquarters Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Mr Coetzee just one question.   You explained it's very difficult to identify whether it's Mr or Mrs</p>

<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a>Dibali so you instructed him kill the occupants in the house or shoot at everybody inside.   Was that in fact the policy when you raided a safe house or a house where ANC cadres were staying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That was in fact the policy Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Well if that was the fact, why then in Jantjies case of this morning didn't they shoot all the occupants in the, what was his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Comrade A's house, I think it was because he was, I accept I mean I'm just speculating, it was because he was an open target in front of a window and could clearly be identified.   There was light in the house, he was sitting in a chair and therefore it was very easy in that case to shoot at a specific target which you could see and identify as I say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> And completely miss him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I don't know whether he was missed or not, I believe he was hit in fact as far as I know, or what I picked up preparing for this hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> What was the report that you received from these people at the end of the day?</p>

<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well I was with them and Joe Mamasela was 100% sure it was Joyce Dibali that he shot and that it, that she was killed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>MEMBER OF COMMISSION	46	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> It turns out that Mamasela lied?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairman, I can only accept that or after reading Mrs Dibali's statement that it was not her that was shot at, and that the person that Joe in fact had in his arms was the other lady that was made mention of.   He did not kill her at all but she must have fainted or pretended fainting because she dropped to the floor on the back verandah there right next to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> It doesn't seem like that is what she would say in her statement.   The impression I get from her statement was that, perhaps to assist you, she actually says that as she opened the door and she saw the three of you, Joe Mamasela actually identified her and said "that is  Joyce" and she also says that she also recognised Joe Mamasela's voice because she also knew Joe Mamasela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I can't remember him at all identifying her, I did read that statement of hers and I did see that she recognised his voice and go further even and said the second man that was present must have been a black man and she's fairly sure that the third guy was a white guy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Yes and in fact she says that she was also shot, she received some shot wounds, she ended up in hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Mrs Joyce Dibali.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> So she didn't escape unscathed, she was actually shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> She was hurt yes, I don't know whether it was bullet wounds or shrapnel but she was hurt yes Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Has the identity of the person who was shot ever been established?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I'm not sure Mr Chairman, I think in the letter, accompanying letter of the Botswana police department it was mentioned and I think even mentioned that two people were hurt in the incident.   I'm not 100% sure I might be mistaken but not to my knowledge the specific identification of this lady.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> Mr Chairman if I could be of assistance, on the second page of Exhibit G you will find in paragraph 2 that mention is made of one Sadie Mkwanjane, also known as Sadie Phule and that this name is repeated in the statement by...I remember picking up something but I can't pinpoint the position now but I remember that these seemed to have been people with almost either close friends or relations that were from South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> By the way Captain Coetzee, according to Mrs Dibali's statement I've already told you that she said when she opened the door at midnight to go to the railway station, when she opened the door she saw people standing there.   What she's really saying in her evidence is that that was not really a coincidence, the message she's giving is that she's of the impression that you knew that around midnight she was going to get out of the house to go and meet somebody from South Africa who would have been getting off the train.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No...</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Is there something that you haven't told us about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No not at all from our side.   The feedback I got later was that Rola was apparently not in the house that</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a>2b	night /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a>MEMBER OF COMMISSION	48	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a>night because Mrs Joyce Dibali took him to the airport earlier that afternoon, afternoon to fly to Lusaka, Zambia</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a>and therefore at the time was not in the house.   But the impression I had was that they forgot something in the bakkie and they came to the bakkie to fetch it.   I couldn't make out or remember what clothes they had on, whether they were in pyjamas or dressed to leave, but the impression as I say I got they came to the bakkie to fetch something that they might have forgotten.   That is the conclusion I arrived at at a later stage, but not at all had we at any time had any information that they were going to leave that night 12 o'clock to pick someone up, not at all I can assure you of that.   Not from, not to my or anyone of my specific group's knowledge.   If Captain Jan Coetzee or Captain Rudy Kraus had that knowledge I can assure you 100% did not convey it to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Except that it is not in your evidence as to how you had planned to enter the house and so on and so forth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes, I suppose we would have kicked the back door down in an event to get into the house if they did not, by coincidence, come out of the house at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Why do you say you suppose, was it not part of the plan, didn't you have a complete and detailed plan as to how you were going to gain access into the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes, we would have gone early the night, 9 o'clock, when we entered when there was still light in the house and around the house, but as I say as the result of the neighbour's dogs as a result of a disco or a party that went on right in front of the house of Mrs Dibali and as a result of a lot of people in the street in front of that</p>

<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a>house, it was impossible to enter the house at that time.  I had to wait for two and a half, three hours for the thunder storm to break to give us the necessary cover to get into the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> So the thunder storm wasn't part of the planning, it was coincidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Completely coincidence as I've mentioned in my manuscript too Mr Chairman, I think I say that there were dogs barking...</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Yes but you say you were waiting for the thunder storm to break so you could get a cover for the house, so that was not at all the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Not at all, not at all, it was all, we did not know of a party that went on in front of the house with the people in the street, of the neighbour's dogs that we wouldn't be able to get over the neighbour's fence to get into the back yard and we couldn't enter through the street.  No it's purely coincidence Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> I think in fairness to Ms Dibali's statement I must ask you this.   Was it in your plans as to who was to go and knock first, how that person was to get access into the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No we were three to go into the house, that was myself, Almond and Joe and arriving at the house I suppose it was earlier and there was occupants in the house and the doors were still open...(end of side b)...no just to get into the house and get to the targets Mr Chairman.   It's very difficult to plan, there's always unforeseen factors.  As I say, the information of the information gathering groups is always a week old or maybe two weeks old so it's impossible to tell what is going on on a specific night in</p>

<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> May I just correct something?   I put it to you that it was her cousin, I've had a chance to read the statement more carefully now, her cousin and her mother-in-law were the people she was going to go and fetch from the railway station.  The woman whom she mentions by name was in the house with her but it was not her cousin.</p>

<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was quite possible yes if there were other occupants in the room, that is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Your evidence now was that this house in Botswana was according to your knowledge a safe-house and a transit house?</p>

<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That was his first operation that he went on and I said, my instructions to him was as soon as we start firing he should fire into the bedroom and throw the hand grenade into the bedroom, but he was completely stunned and when we ran away he started running.   He as yet has not fired one shot or threw the hand grenade, but I suppose it was because it was his first operation of that nature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR JANSEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Did you know at that stage that that was his first operation to handle a hand grenade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes, with Vlakplaas yes of that nature, across border one yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Was there any reason why him and not the others was given the hand grenade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well Mr Chairman he wanted to go with and as it was his first operation I thought it fit to not have him with a group of three that had to burst into the house, but rather in the outside from a different direction to limit the possibility of we one another shooting at each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Did Mr Vermeulen fire any shots that evening?</p>

<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Sorry Captain, in answer to the question which was asked by the gentleman over there, are you in fact saying that this house was used by a safe-house in the sense that we have come to understand a safe-house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct and a transit house, it was used, it was frequented by the ANC, used by the ANC as a safe-house and apparently Joe Mamasela stayed in this house whilst training with the ANC in Botswana Mr Chairman.</p>

So I am afraid that you would find a fairly lot of detail not in this manuscript which came to my knowledge either later on or I had at the time just, slipped my mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> In your application Mr Coetzee you do mention that the house was used for ANC activities, and this in your evidence would be one of the activities you've referred to on page 21 in your application?

<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairman, that was compiled recently after as I say, during the Harms Commission after having sight of the documents in possession of my lawyers it became knowledge to me, that fact but at the time of the manuscript unfortunately as I say, not.</p>

What happened was, well I will just before I say another thing is that the same thing that used to be said in Vlakplaas, they used to say we must meet elsewhere.   They will say this before time.   They then gave us the instruction to go to Zeerust where we went to a  nearby farm near (indistinct) near the farm, that is where we really discussed the issue about Gaberone, that's where we were de-briefed to go to that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Who gave you the instructions to go to Zeerust?</p>

<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a>there was his de-briefing or discussion as to how we were going to get to the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Who conducted this briefing, in other words who told you what the operation was going to entail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well all these white people who were there, Jan Coetzee, Vermeulen there was a lot of discussion as to how all these things were going to do, some people were opposing as to whether Dirk Coetzee was to be involved and the like.  After that, that is where Dirk said we were to go together because they didn't want to include whites, that is how we ended up getting together to the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Who gave you your instructions what to do that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Who, I was given the instruction by Dirk Coetzee together with these other white people who chose the other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What did your role involve, in other words what were you then told to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I was together with an officer, Paul Van Dyk who was driving, we were to remain in the car which was not that far from where the operation was to be conducted.   We were able to see whatever was to happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> How far from the house were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Approximately 200 metres or so.</p>

<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> During the whole operation did you stay with Van Dyk at that point near the house where you had been left?</p>

<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes we were right in the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did the people who went to the house did they return later that evening to the point where you were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes it didn't take long, we just heard some shootings for about 10 minutes or so and these people were back, they were running back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Could you see what was happening at the house or could you only hear what was happening at the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well I couldn't see clearly because it was dark and again there was rain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you then return to South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes we returned to South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Were you told by the others what had happened at the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well like it was, you know usually after an operation there was no need to ask from a colleague as to how it happened and the like, there was no need for that.  I didn't even want to ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> During that time did you regard yourself as doing the work that you were supposed to do as a member of Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Indeed it was necessarily so because I was part and parcel of the operation under Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Were you at all times acting according to the instructions you had received?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes because whenever there was an operation we used to do whatever was instructed to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you know what the intention of Captain Dirk Coetzee and the other people were that went to the house, what were they going to do there?</p>

<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a>were talking about the activities that the ANC people do, although there were some people who were targeted, but generally the house had to be shot at as a whole.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Was anything mentioned of injuring or killing anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was already indicated that Joyce Dibali was a common name(?), of course Joyce as a name was mentioned, the surname I couldn't remember and there was another person who came in our discussion but I can't remember who it was.</p>

You say that Joyce's name was mentioned, what are you really saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> When I talk of Joyce it seems as if an indication was that she was the one who was more active in that house.</p>

<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> As I said, it was that if at all there was an operation to be done like going to Lesotho there was no further instruction you know, they just said we are going to meet at Ladybrand, they say at the same time they just said to us we are leaving.</p>

I'm not specifically saying that Dirk said such a specific thing.</p>

<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Can you explain this incident to the Committee about that evening when you went to Botswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> When we got to Botswana that night Joe and I and Captain Dirk Coetzee and David Tsikalanga and Paul Van Dyk were together.   I was given a Makarov pistol, Joe was given a Tokarev, Captain Vermeulen, I think he was a Lieutenant at the time, Lt Vermeulen had an HMC sub-machine gun which had a silencer and Captain Dirk Coetzee also had a gun with a silencer.  David Tsikalanga and Paul Van Dyk were, remained in the van in which we were travelling which was some distance from the house.   The people that went to that house that night were Captain Dirk Coetzee, Lt Vermeulen,</p>

<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes sir it was Joe Mamasela who knew this house that we were going to and I also knew it by this time because it was shown to me when we went there the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What happened when you reached the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> When we got there, Joe was walking in front, I was behind him and behind me was Dirk Coetzee and he had smeared something black on his face and his hands.   While we were standing there people came out of the house, ladies, I do not remember what they used to light their way, I did not see what it was.   Joe... (End of 3a)  One of the ladies fell to the ground and then we entered the house, there was a door going, leading to the passage and there were bedrooms and Dirk Coetzee pushed me back and he and Joe went in to the passage and they started shooting.   Gunshots rang out as he and Joe were shooting and I was standing behind them in the house in the kitchen if I remember correctly.   Thereafter when he went out, it was myself and Joe and I shot and as we were leaving I shot once if I remember correctly and there I wasn't seeing anyone, we were just shooting randomly.  I just had one shot towards the closed doors and we went out.  We passed where Lt Vermeulen was standing near the window, I cannot remember whether he shot, whether he fired a shot or not because at that stage the way the shots were ringing I cannot say.   We then ran to the car and went back and we crossed the border through the fence and we went back to a certain base which we were using which was somewhere near a hillside where there was a house.</p>

<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes sir, he said that he killed Joyce Dibali and he was talking a lot about it saying that he was sure that it was her that he had shot.  I did not know her, I had never seen her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> When you shot at the door, what went on in your mind at that stage?</p>

<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> ...did you hear the name Joyce Dibali mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I heard it several times sir because there was another incident which I linked to this one, the one of Mowabi(?) Dibali, there was an incident where I was present where I had participated when he was in Soweto while they were looking for this person's sister by the name of Joyce or Lilian, so I assumed that Joyce was known as being in Botswana because they took her brother Mowabi Dibali.   The fact that we went to Gaberone was not that we were going there to seek out Joyce Dibali's specifically, I had heard her name several times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> ...the name Lilian Kahile as apparently the unknown woman was Joyce Dibali, Lilian Kahile, where did you get this name from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That was another name, I don't know if it was an MK the name that she used, but the name that I heard most about was that one.    I don't know whether it was an MK name or whether there actually was someone else by that name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> ...in your application you said two women were present at the house, apparently Joyce Dibali and Lilian Kahile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Sir I do not deny what you are saying.   This name was mentioned often by Jan Coetzee and Joe Mamasela, they are the only people who knew these people very well so I got the name from them.   I don't know those people up to this</p>

<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> ...separate, divorce them if possible and concentrate on the Joyce Dibali incident.   Are you saying that the name Lilian Kahile belongs to the incident where you abducted Mohabi Dibali, is that what you are alleging now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I'm talking about after his abduction that is where I became familiar with these names.   It is possible, I do not dispute it, that even this incident where there was this shooting in Gaberone that these names were mentioned by Jan Coetzee and Joe Mamasela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Captain Dirk Coetzee never mentioned Lilian Kahile, instead he said "an unknown woman" as well as Tsikalanga.   You are the only person who comes with this name.</p>

<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> You say that while you were standing there, that is in front of the house, while you were standing there these people came out of the house, is that what you said?</p>

<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> As at the time when these people opened the door you people were not advancing towards the house or towards the door, you were actually standing there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> We were next to the house if I remember correctly sir, we were not far from the house, we were right next to the house.   I said that when the people were coming out of the house, we were next to the house, we were not far from it at all.   We were standing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> ...I'm talking about standing, you can stand near or far next to the house it doesn't matter.   The point is you say that you were stationary, you were standing, you were not moving towards the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes we were standing.   We were standing sir because Mr Dirk Coetzee was saying something, I cannot remember what he was saying we should do and then these people appeared, but we were busy talking.   He was speaking to us, I cannot remember what he was saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> ...standing there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I am unable to say sir but it was a very short while, I'd say that we had just got there, we had just stopped there it wasn't a long time at all, we just stopped when he was starting to talk to us.   I don't know what he was saying  when these ladies appeared, you could see the light and they appeared.</p>

<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The instruction I received was that we were to go to that house, when we get there what I was to do  was to shoot any person that I saw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Did you hear any instructions given to Mr Mamasela to shoot, as the person who knew Mrs Joyce Dibali?</p>

<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> In your evidence you stated that Mr Mamasela knew this house, in your evidence.   To your knowledge how did he know this house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> According to my knowledge Joe was someone who worked for the ANC in the Gaberone region and he knew these places there.   When I went with him to look at this house, keep it under surveillance, there was no problem because he knew this place and that was why I was told to accompany him.   He showed me this place because he knew the area,</p>

<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> I'd like you to tell me a little bit more please about what happened after these two women came out of the house.   You have told us that you had just stopped there when they came out and Joe grabbed one and a shot was fired.   Is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> What happened then, was the door of the house still open?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Where we had entered the door was open.</p>

<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Inside the house Dirk Coetzee and Joe Mamasela were standing at the door shooting inside, towards, in the direction of the other rooms.   There was a passage and there were rooms leading off from the passages and they were</p>

<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Captain Coetzee and Joe Mamasela, you told us they went into the house, they were standing at the door shooting in down the passage in the direction of the doors.  Is that so?</p>

<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Did they go any further into the house or did they then turn and go out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No one went into any of the other rooms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> So they stood at the one and shot down the passage and no one went into any of the other rooms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No, no one went in, I was standing behind them.</p>

<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes that is what I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> So they made no attempt to find out if Joyce Dibali or her husband were in any of these other rooms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> As far as I can remember sir, I don't know anything about them doing anything like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> You said they did not go into any of the other rooms, so they didn't look to see who was in the other rooms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes I say so sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> They shot this one person, left her lying, fired some shots down the passage and left the house, is that so?</p>

<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I would not have been able to go through past these people that were standing in the doorway shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> ...were shooting and they didn't go further and you were not able to, is that the position?</p>

<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Were you instructed or was the name of Mrs Dibali's husband ever mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I cannot remember being told of any such name, it's possible that I was told but I cannot remember it anymore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Weren't you instructed to kill the woman and her husband, wasn't that the whole purpose of the operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It's possible that it was so sir, but I am merely relying on my memory of what I was told.   I'm not disputing the fact that there are people with such names or that was the intention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> You can only remember that the instruction was to kill all the occupants of the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Sir I remember being instructed to kill the ANC people occupying that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Weren't the names of Mr Dibali and his wife mentioned to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It's possible that their names were mentioned but I cannot remember, it's a long time since these incidents took place.   A lot of things have happened in which I was involved and I know sir that I am supposed to try and recall this specific one that we are dealing at this point in time, but I have difficulty remembering events and the sequence in</p>

<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a>MEMBER OF COMMISSION	71	NOFOMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a>which they took place because I had absolutely no contact with the people with whom I was involved in these things, apart from hearing them denying that I was, they were involved with me or not.   As far as my memory serves me, I cannot remember all the details of this but there are merely certain things where I can dispute but most of the time I cannot, because I was never in contact with any of the people that I was involved with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Mr Nofomela you've told us of two incidents now where you were involved, the one in Lesotho and this one in Botswana.   You only fired one shot in Lesotho and one shot in Botswana, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Were you ever involved in any incident, for which you are asking for amnesty, where you fired more than one shot on occasions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Maybe if I'm given a chance one day to try and recall specifically, it is possible that there was an incident or two where I was involved and had fired more than one shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Mr Nofomela I'm putting this to you because if you want amnesty you should tell us the whole truth and I'm getting the impression that you are saying I've always had only a minor role to play, I only fired one shot, I wasn't involved, I never killed anybody as far as we've heard up to now.   I'm not sure that you're in fact telling us the whole truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET-MARAIS::</span> Mr Chairman that statement is not correct, the witness has given evidence about Mr Mkenge where he participated personally in the killing and stabbed him with a knife.</p>

<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Have you fired more than one shot at a person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It's possible sir that where there were several of us firing that I fired several times without knowing whether I had finished a magazine or not.   What I am saying here is what I recall and what I am sure about, but you know I'm not sure exaggerating in order to strengthen my case for the sake of amnesty would be the correct thing to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Would it be correct to minimise your role either?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did play a role sir and it is possible that the bullet fired from my firearm is the one that injured or fatally the person.   I am not trying to create an impression that I played a lesser role than any of the other applicants, I'm not trying to hide anything.   Firstly sir I am the one that said I am the one who mentioned the story about the hit squads when everyone else was denying it.   Why would I then come here today and try and portray myself as being less guilty than anyone else.   I am sorry that you see it as, you seem to be getting the impression that I am trying to portray myself as less guilty than the others or that I played a lesser role than everyone else.   I did participate and the facts that I am putting before you today is as I can recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Mr Nofomela you had the house under surveillance on the incident in question, you and Mr Mamasela.   Mr Mamasela obviously was familiar with the surroundings, he knew the house fairly well.   What was the reason then during that day to have the house under surveillance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Sir the way Joe knew that area, I am not saying</p>

<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a>that he knew that house before we went there, but the way in which he knew the area so that it was easier for me also to be able to identify this house as the house that we were targeting.   That is why he went with me, because he knew the area so well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> On your way to that house, you didn't speak at all about the identity of the people who owned that house, do you want to have us believe that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It is possible that we did speak, but what I can remember, especially after this incident, Joe spoke quite a lot about this saying that he knew Joyce Dibali and he had no doubt that he had killed her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> ...in your earlier evidence when you stated that you didn't know the name Joyce Dibali?</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did say earlier that after the incident he spoke quite often about her, even before that where I mentioned Mohabi Dibali and where they spoke about Joyce Dibali and Mohabi Dibali.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> The name of the husband was Rola, did you ever hear the name Rola Dibali?</p>

She says she will be seated in here to listen to the evidence.   I may perhaps just to show the Chairman what she has written on the return of service to confirm what I have said, that she won't be able to talk for herself Mr Chairman, she is satisfied with just listening.</p>

<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   Mr Nofomela by whom were you briefed in 1981 about the abduction of a person by the name of Mohabi Dibali?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Captain Jan Coetzee and Lt Vermeulen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What were their instructions to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> They instructed myself and Joe Mamasela that we should go to Soweto and go and abduct Mohabi Dibali saying that they would like to question him about his sister who is a member of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did any of you know Mohabi Dibali?</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> (Inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Joe Mamasela knew Mohabi Dibali.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Can you describe to the Committee the abduction of Mohabi Dibali?</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> We left Vlakplaas, Joe Mamasela and I, after we had been instructed by Jan Coetzee and Lt Vermeulen and Jan Coetzee had said that we should use false number plates on my vehicle which we were using.   We went to Soweto and when we were near the place, I can't remember who remembered between Joe and myself, who remembered that we did not swop number plates.   I remember Joe going to urinate outside so that he could wet some sand and then he covered my number plates, I think he was driving at that stage, because he knew Soweto better than I did.   I'm not sure but we went to Soweto to the house where Dibali was staying, Joe knew that house, he even knew the address.   When we go there we encountered a lady, I think it was a young girl if I remember correctly, and when we got there Joe asked where is</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a>4a	Mohabi /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a>MR DE WET-MARAIS	77	NOFOMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a>Mohabi Dibali.   This girl said...(the speaker's microphone is not on)...</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Yes, you were talking about the young lady that you encountered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes sir.   When we got there Joe asked where Mohabi Dibali was and this girl said he wasn't there.   Joe suspected that he was there and he said that we should go into the house and we then went into the house looking for Mohabi Dibali inside this house.   When we entered one room, Joe said here he is hiding behind the wardrobe.   We found him and took him and Joe then said we want our money from him, he sort of made as if we were there to get some money from Mohabi, pretending as if he owed us money.   We took him and put him into the back seat and I cannot remember whether Joe got into the back seat with him or whether it was me.   As we pulled away in the car this girl came running out and I could see that she was going to other people not too far from the house.   We then left and we went to Roodepoort near the mines where we told we would meet Captain Coetzee and Vermeulen.   We then met them there and there was also a Captain Grobbelaar from Protea Security Branch.   From there we followed them until we got to Zeerust where we went to a house near a dam which was not occupied, together with Mohabi Dibali.   Before we went there, we had taken him out of the car so that Captain Coetzee and Grobbelaar could see the person whom we had just abducted by taking him out of the back seat of the car where we had put him.   They then advised us, instructed us to close up his face and also tie his hands behind his back and put him back into the back seat.   We then went, proceeded until we reached this house where he was questioned</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a>4a	intensively /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a>MR DE WET-MARAIS	78	NOFOMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a>intensively about his sister who was in Botswana.   Although I was not part of the team which was interrogating him, Joe was there because he knew his sister and he knew him as well and he could argue with him when he was saying something that Joe knew, which was in dispute with what Joe knew and Grobbelaar was also there and Vermeulen, as well as Jan Coetzee.   There was a time where he was assaulted and then taken outside and when he got outside, Captain Vermeulen would bring him so that we could also assault him and we'd assault him and hit him with fists and kicked him.   There was a stage where he lost consciousness and he was lying on the ground.   This happened the afternoon where we had abducted him and that evening, that night he was interrogated and he would answer questions in several ways and he was assaulted to such an extent that he was swollen.  The people that were assaulting him the most were myself, Joe Mamasela and Vermeulen.   Grobbelaar and Coetzee did not do anything.  The people who assaulted him the most were myself, Joe Mamasela and Vermeulen, we would kick him and hit him with fists and so on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Do you know whether the information that Captain Coetzee was after was then obtained from Mohabi Dibali?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Sir as time went by after this incident, if I remember correctly I can say that I was linking this incident in Gaberone because to me it seemed as though in order for us to have gone to Gaberone to this house, it was as a result of information which we had extracted from this person whom we had abducted.   When the time came for me to discuss this incident with Dirk Coetzee, it seemed that I had made a mistake in linking these two incidents because it was not so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a>4a	QUESTION: /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a>MR DE WET-MARAIS	79	A NOFOMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you ever see Mohabi Dibali after this interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I last saw him in that house, I've never seen him since.  I then went to Vlakplaas where I had left him with Grobbelaar, Coetzee and Vermeulen and Joe and I went back to Vlakplaas and left him behind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Was he alive when you last saw him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He was still alive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> When you refer to Captain Coetzee in this regard are you referring to Captain Jan Coetzee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes sir because there was a mistake made at some stage where I was saying Mr Dirk Coetzee stopped working in 1982 whereas it was in 1981.   Jan Coetzee, then Jan Coetzee came but he came while Coetzee was still there in 81 so there were two Coetzee's there at the same time and you know when one thinks back now you tend to mix the two up, you would be talking about Dirk Coetzee and actually be saying Jan Coetzee.   They would come to the farm while working at Krugersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Was Captain Jan Coetzee the head of the West Rand Security Branch at Krugersdorp at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I cannot say whether he was the commander but I know that he was working there and I know that he was involved with that branch.   I cannot say whether he was the commanding officer or if there was somebody in higher authority than he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you ever hear anything about the fact that you used your car with the correct number plates during the abduction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes sir I heard when it was time for me to leave Vlakplaas when I got home, I heard from my mom that there</p>

<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a>were people who seemed to be police who were looking for me saying that I had abducted someone in Soweto.   I then reported that to Lt Vermeulen who instructed me to take my car to Vlakplaas until such time as it was safe to take it back and use it without any problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Do you know how the police found you and the fact that you used your car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Sir I would think that that girl that was running to the other house could have written down the number plate of my car and given it to the police and that is probably how the police knew where I lived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you see this abduction and assault of Mohabi Dibali as part of your duties as a policeman at Vlakplaas?</p>

<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I do not understand your question correctly, do you mean by looking at him and noticing what condition he was in?</p>

<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> You thought that they had killed him didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did not think so even if I had thought so there was nobody that was going to do that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I mean that even though I might have thought that they would kill this person, there was nothing I would have been able to have done to have stopped something like that happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> You say you didn't think they were going to, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I cannot remember thinking that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> What did you think had happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Since I was sent to abduct this person and take him from point A to point B, I merely assumed that they would see what they were going to do with him you know I did not know what they were going to do with him, whether they were going to kill him or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Didn't you think about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No I cannot remember thinking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> You see I'm looking at your application for amnesty and you were asked whether death, injuries and damage were suffered as a result of the kidnapping and assault and your reply was</p>

<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a>Do you remember saying that in your application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes that he was injured as a result of the assaults I said that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> You presumed that he was eventually killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It's possible but a presumption is not necessarily what one knows it's just something that you presume.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> When I asked you what you thought you avoided saying that didn't you, you avoided saying that you presumed that he had been killed when I questioned you about it, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I heard your question as though what I thought they were going to do with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Were you told when you made an application that you must be truthful if you applied for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes I was told.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> To a question by your counsel you said you saw it as part of your duty to abduct and assault Mr Dibali?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> But are you saying that to abduct and assault a relative of a political activist is part of your duty simply because he's a relative of a political activist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Sir the way I was told by the people who instructed me to abduct this person and assault him the way that we did assault him, there was no way in which I could not do that and say no I cannot do this because he's related to this person.   There are a lot of people who become victims because of questioning authority at Vlakplaas and I could simply not have done that.   I just had to do what I was told to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> It's easy to say I assaulted him simply because I was given instructions to assault him, but it's a different thing, as you said in a question to your counsel, to say that you actually saw it as part of your duty to assault him.   How can you ever see assaulting somebody</p>

<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a>merely because he's a relative of a political activist as being part of police duty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The people who were instructing me sir were people who whose command I was, if they said to me go and fetch a certain person and bring him here, I had to do that.   I had to bring that person to them.   My duty was to obey their instructions without question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> ...are you saying that any instructions given to you by a superior officer you must obey and that was your police duty.   Is that what you're asking us to accept?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Sir if I believed that what I was sent for that he wanted me to fetch Dibali so that he could question him, I saw it in the line of my duties.  It was the instruction that I should go and fetch him for interrogations.   The fact that he was brought there and assaulted is something that I followed when I saw it happening, I was not told beforehand that we were going to abduct this person and assault him if he does not answer the questions the way he should have answered.   I merely followed instructions given by my superiors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> ...instructions were to go and abduct him so that he could be interrogated, those are the instructions as you told us.</p>

<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> ...was assaulted and you also assaulted him?</p>

<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> ...to assault him, you were only instructed to go and abduct him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I said that Vermeulen said that we should assault him, Vermeulen started assaulting him and Joe also started</p>

<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a>assaulting him and then I joined in and then Joe and I were assaulting him and Vermeulen was present.   I did not start assaulting him when I had abducted him I was told that he was not telling the truth and that we should assault him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> ...you were actually instructed to assault him.   You told us that he was assaulted and you took part in the assault, that you told us, but you didn't tell us that you were actually instructed to assault him.  Were you in fact instructed to assault him or did you just see people assaulting him and then you joined?</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I said that Vermeulen is someone who speaks mainly Northern Sotho and he spoke in Northern Sotho that we should assault this person because he is not telling the truth and he was saying that while assaulting this person, after asking him a question because as I said Joe was also disputing what he was saying because Joe also knew him and knew the area where he was staying.   I was also told to assault him and that's when I assaulted him, severely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> ...okay Nofomela now you can assault him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> You know sir there was this process of assaulting a person when bringing them out of this place where he was being questioned, he would be pushed and be hit with fists, he just said "hit him" as a general instruction to the two of us.   He did not say Nofomela hit him he just said hit him so that he can speak the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Did you understand them to be instructions to you as well to assault him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> ...because he said things you people didn't want or didn't agree with?</p>

There was nothing I could ask him because I did not know anything about the information that they were trying to extract.   Joe was the one that knew his sister and knew where he moved around and they were arguing about things like that.   So there was an argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> ...that he was assaulted for having told the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I cannot dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> You told us you were not part of the interrogation team, you had nothing to do with it did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Have you been present at any other interrogation apart from this?</p>

<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Do you think it is fair to say that interrogation really means beating somebody up whilst you're asking him questions?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> You were familiar with this whole process of assault, interrogation, assault until you got the answer that was satisfactory to you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Was it quite often Mr Nofomela that you participated in assaulting relatives with the view to extracting information from them of suspected ANC activists? (end of 4a)...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I remember one whose name was Japie Maponja who was also assaulted because of his brother (indistinct) Maponja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> You were not part of the interrogating team, you were invited by Vermeulen to participate in the assault of Mr Dibali?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Do you know what the rank was of Mr Vermeulen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I think he was a lieutenant or something or he had just been promoted to a captain, I'm not sure, I cannot remember.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes I used to receive instructions from him quite often.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes because he was at Vlakplaas and Captain Jan</p>

<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a>Coetzee was at Krugersdorp and that was the person that moved around with Joe Mamasela and I was with Vermeulen so my commander, my immediate commander at the time was Vermeulen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Did you all the time receive instructions from Vermeulen without clearing them with your Vlakplaas commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> When Dirk Coetzee left, I took instructions from Vermeulen because he was my immediate superior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> ...happened in October 1981, Mr Dirk Coetzee was no longer at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He was still there but when this incident took place where we were given these instructions to go and abduct him, I did not see him, I did not communicate with him about this incident.   Vermeulen was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Was there anyone who told you that from the time he disappeared from the scene you would now be receiving instructions from either Vermeulen or from Mr Jan Coetzee?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> With regard to any duties that you had to execute.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Often Vermeulen, even when Dirk Coetzee was working there, I would often be placed in a group under his command because we would often be sent out in groups.   You would be deployed in groups and you would receive instructions from the commander of your group, so even with regard to this incident he was the one that instructed me and I was to follow his orders.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> He died at John Vorster Square prison in 1982, it is stated the day before he could be taken to court and this has been confirmed by the sister.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Would that be a year later because the abduction incident occurred in October 1981 isn't it so?</p>

(Discussion between Mr Mpshe and Mrs Dibali).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> There is some mention that Mohabi Dibali died detention on 8 August 1982.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET-MARAIS::</span> Mr Chairman I cannot remember the date from the Harms Commission, I am now looking here in the arguments presented on behalf of the Security Branch before the Harms Commission and it was their evidence that Dibali was transferred to Soweto police cells apparently on 21 October 1981, that was now after this incident.   The police at that stage denied the whole abduction at the Harms Commission, but according to the evidence presented by the police, after the date that he was apparently abducted according to his family in Soweto when they laid a charge of abduction on 12 October, on 21 October he was transferred to the police cells in Soweto.   I do not find any reference to a date but I remember from the Harms Commission that he did die in detention later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Was he kept in detention the whole time, do you know?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> That is something the record should show, the Soweto police cell records should show, if he came there how long he remained there and where he went.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Thank you Mr Chairman for your indulgence.  Mr Chairman the information given to me by Mrs Dibali, that is the sister to Mohabi, is that Mohabi was detained on 6 August 1981 and then he was released on 29 January 1982.   He was re-arrested on 5 August 1982 and died on 8 August 1982 in detention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Could you give me those first dates again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Yes I will repeat.   He was detained 6 August 1981 and then released 29 January 1982.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> He was abducted...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> In 81.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> October 81, according to what you now tell us he was in jail then, he was detained, that was during the period of detention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Chairman I cannot say whether this is correct or not but I get this from the sister who has handwritten information which she has brought with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> In other words from the time that he was abducted, as far as the family was concerned, the next they knew that he was released, the following January.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> No he was detained two months before he was abducted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> According to the application he was abducted in October 81.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> So he was detained two months before he was abducted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> He was detained two months before the abduction.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Yes, he was detained two months before his abduction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Before his abduction, we can say he was detained on 6 August 1981, this is now just my reasoning, and then abducted in October 1981 and then released on 29 January 82 and then re-arrested on 5 August 82 and then died on 8 August 82, that is about three days after the second detention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Chairman seeing that the Chair has indicated that in fact I have quite a number of questions to put to the applicant, I will carry them over until the following morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Nofomela are you quite sure about the date on which this person was abducted?   You have just heard the information that according to the family he was detained on 6 August and you say that you (indistinct), could it be that you are wrong with your month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It is possible sir because this is something that I am relying on my memory for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> ...verify the date or at least the month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I cannot promise but I will think about it, I will try my best to recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET-MARAIS::</span> Mr Chairman there were affidavits handed in at the Harms Commission by attorney Priscilla Jana who was handling the matter for the family at that stage and by, if I remember correctly, a person Lizzie who was at the house when Mohabi Dibali was abducted.   According to those affidavits taken during that time of the abduction that was on 12 October 1981.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a>MEMBER OF COMMISSION	92	A NOFOMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Could you remember whether the abduction was before the onslaught in Botswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is one of the things that I must have mixed up, I thought it was before the onslaught in Botswana and while I was speaking to Dirk Coetzee it seems as though he's the one that I thought was Jan Coetzee in the situation, I found that I had mixed up my facts a bit, not knowing which one to place first and which one followed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET-MARAIS::</span> Mr Chairman can I refer you to, it's Exhibit B.106 and Exhibit B.107 before the Harms Commission.  Those are the two affidavits, I'm not sure whether they are in the book before this Commission but it should be in the record of the Harms Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> Mr Chairman if I may also come in at this stage, in the initial proceedings we indicated to yourselves that we are in possession of the typed records of the Harms Commission but not of the Annexures which are referred to as the so-called "B Series" of documents.   Since our last hearing in Durban we have come in possession, for purposes of the criminal trial, we have come in possession of those documents and we will try and make an effort to get these two particular documents to yourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Yes thank you, if we can at any rate clear up what seems to be occupying the minds of members of the Committee just now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> Yes I might just add that it created volumes and volumes of confusion in the Harms Commission, this aspect probably occupies about two volumes of evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Yes, very well.   We would be indebted to you if you are in a position to let us have that as soon as possible.   Mr Mpshe you may proceed with the questions that</p>

<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Nofomela I'm taking you back to the house in Soweto where you found Mohabi Dibali.   When you abducted him did he resist, what happened in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What did he do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> As far as I can remember him not wanting to go, the first thing was I was surprised when we found that he had hidden himself and also when we left with him, he tried to resist but he seemed more afraid, he was coming along but not of his own free will.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Was anything done to him in the house to make him give in and accompany you people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I think Joe was carrying a gun and I also carried a gun, between the two of us, one of us produced a firearm as far as I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> (Inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He was slapped as far as I can remember and there was something else that was done to him to try and force him to come out of the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> The thing that I want you to tell this Committee, the thing that you did to him in the house, you were present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> As I say I had a firearm, one of us had a firearm and I think we threatened him with the firearm and we also assaulted him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> (Inaudible - no microphone).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I think Joe and I did assault him inside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What did you do in the house in assaulting him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a>4b	ANSWER: /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a>MR MPSHE	94	A NOFOMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I cannot say what we did first and what we did secondly, but what I remember is that we assaulted him, what I'm sure of is that we assaulted him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What did you use in assaulting him, yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It's possible that we assaulted him using our fists or I could have kicked him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...use in assaulting him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It's possible that he did something similar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did he just after being assaulted stand up and walk out with you to the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Joe was holding him bringing him and I was walking behind them and he could see that we had firearms and there was no way in which he could resist or try anything or attempt to escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Mr Nofomela you were asked as to what caused him to give in, you said that the two of you had firearms and one of you produced the firearm and then you said to us you also slapped and then you went on to say there was something else again which caused him to come out.   Mr Mpshe asked you what was that other something else and then you go back and you tell us about the assault while we were eagerly waiting for that something else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The other thing that I was referring to was that I could remember that we assaulted him.   I was asked who had assaulted him and what I had done and what I remember is that, I don't know who started assaulting him but what I do remember is that we assaulted him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> You had already said that it was because one of you produced a firearm, you had already said that he was slapped which is assault and then you said there was something else again, and then you go back to assault which</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a>4b	is /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a>MR MPSHE	95	A NOFOMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a>is the second thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I don't understand what, where I am mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> How did you and Mamasela handle him as you were going out, or drag him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He was not dragging him, he was walking alongside him saying "we want our money, we want our money, let's go".  Joe was speaking saying that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> (Inaudible - no microphone).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I assume that it's something that Joe made up as a story for us taking this person away to avoid saying to this person we've been sent here to abduct him, I think it's something that he fabricated himself by saying to this person "we want our money".   This girl that was there should be under the impression that he owed us money and that is why we came to fetch him and not think that we were police who had come to abduct him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> ...when you were walking with him out, in what state was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I cannot remember apart from the fact that he was afraid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MPSHE (contd)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...in the house was he bleeding, injured or whatever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> This happened in a very short space of time, I did not notice whether he was bleeding or whether he was swollen anywhere.   I was walking behind him and Joe was holding him saying that we want our money and put him into the car and we left.  All I know is, all I remember is where he was swollen and he was bleeding was where we had taken him for interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...you could not see in what state he was at the</p>

<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a>MR MPSHE	96	A NOFOMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a>time when you were moving out with him because you participated in the assault as Joe Mamasela grabbed him and walked with him you were following behind and you travelled in the same car with him.  You mean you couldn't see him at all from Soweto to Roodepoort, from Roodepoort to Zeerust, you can't tell whether he was bleeding or swollen or whatever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Sir I cannot remember, I do not want to exaggerate or anything, I cannot remember, I did not pay any attention.  I did not notice, I do not want to answer something by speculating.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> How long did the assault take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Sir as I said he was taken out of the house and even assaulted outside, it was quite some time because I said he even lost consciousness at some stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Would you say he endured the assault for an hour or so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Probably less or approximately an hour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET-MARAIS::</span> Mr Chairman I think there's confusion now because the witness is now talking about the stage where Dibali lost consciousness and that was at the house at Zeerust, not at the house in Soweto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Chairman I do not see any confusion here with respect, I'm still in the house in Soweto where they abducted this man, the initial assault.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a>assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I said sir that this, he was severely assaulted at Zeerust, that is where he lost consciousness, in Soweto...(end of 4b)...he was assaulted because it took it happened in such a short space of time.   Zeerust is where he was severely assaulted and he was bleeding and he was swollen and where he lost consciousness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Be that as it may.   I'm still with you, I'm taking you back into the house in Soweto where you took Mohabi, don't move to Zeerust I'll tell you where we are moving.   How long did the assault take place in Soweto in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was not a long time, it is something that happened over a very brief period because when we found him in the wardrobe it started there where we took him and dragged him outside.   That is where it started, shortly after we had found him it happened over a very brief period because we couldn't stay there too long for fear of the risk of people coming to the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Moving now from the house in Soweto...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> No before you move away from the house, why did you indicate to the interpreter that when you spoke of loss of consciousness he was still at the house?   Why did you give that impression to the interpreter because that's what the interpreter told us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I would say that I cannot hear what the interpreter is saying to you in English, I wouldn't know if she is saying what I am saying because the interpreter made sure of whether I was speaking about Soweto and Zeerust and that is where I indicated.   The incident to which I referred to where Dibali lost consciousness was in Zeerust</p>

<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No sir right from the beginning I was talking about Zeerust where Dibali was unconscious, I never indicated that he had lost consciousness in Soweto.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Mr Nofomela when you say the assault lasted for a short while, can you approximate in terms of minutes or hours what that means to you.    When you say short would it be 30 minutes, would it be an hour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I would say it was less than three minutes, we were in a hurry, we came to abduct a person and this is something that happened in a very short space of time.  We spent a very short space of time in that house after this girl said that he was not there.   I'm referring to after this girl told us that he was not there.   After we had found him there we spent a very short period of time with him in that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> That would be three minutes?</p>

Mr Chairman, members of the Committee it is the 21st today, a continuation in the Dirk Coetzee &amp; Others application.   Mr Nofomela, we are now moving to Zeerust.   You testified that Mohabi was assaulted, kicked, slapped and so on, what other things were used in assaulting him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Sir I'd say that to explain what happened in detail, apart from what I can remember, would be difficult.  It's 16 years since this incident took place and I cannot, it's impossible for me to remember exactly what took place in sequence.   I'm sorry that I do not have that memory to provide you with satisfactory answers.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> As I have said sir, it was something that took place over a while, I'm not sure how it happened.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I would guess as far as that is concerned because it is difficult to remember how long you assaulted this person for after so many years.   I do not believe that I</p>

<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Sir I'm here to tell the truth, taking guesses would be telling lies, I could take a guess and say one or two hours and it could have been five hours or three minutes.   I'm sorry sir, it's been a long time I really cannot guess.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> How many persons all in all were assaulting Mohabi in the Zeerust house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was myself, Joe Mamasela and Lt Vermeulen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...any resistance during the assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He was not fighting, he was not resisting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...where to was he taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Questioning proceeded and I don't know where he ended up because we left him behind there and left back to Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...there with whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> We left him at that house with Captain Coetzee and Lt Vermeulen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...you said he was assaulted...</p>

<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> To take you a little bit back, back to the assault, you say he was assaulted by the three of you and then interrogated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He was assaulted, it would happen at intervals, he would be assaulted and then questioned up until such a stage where he lost consciousness, that was the last, after that we left and left him there.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> If you can remember, how many times was he interrogated at Zeerust?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Isn't this one long process in which he is assaulted during the interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Chairman, as I heard the witness he was assaulted and thereafter interrogated which means that the assault would stop and the interrogation would take place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Isn't it all part of the transaction where the assault takes place in order to get answers to questions so they would assault him until he answers questions that they want him to answer?   What would be the advantage of breaking it up into little compartments from your point of view?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Chairman I'm doing this in order to determine the manner in which this man was being treated and even if Mr Chairman it can be said, with respect, that this was one transaction but it is clear that assault would take place and the assault would stop and he would be interrogated and thereafter assaulted.   Now these are compartmentalised instances which have a bearing on full disclosure.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I was told that we should fetch him, he was going to be asked, interrogated about his sister, we should go and abduct him, that is all I know about him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Would my conclusion be right that this man was abducted, assaulted, interrogated, assaulted simply in order to get information from him and not that he was an activist, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes I also see it as that, in that way sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You testified yesterday that you had to do this on him in order to get information about the sister, sister's activities.   Who are you referring to when you say "sister's activities"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> They spoke sir and then there was the name of Joyce Dibali mentioned and the name Lilian so I'm not sure who exactly they were talking about.   The people who knew these people were Joe Mamasela and them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...because evidence was led yesterday that Joe Mamasela knew Joyce Dibali very well even where she lived and he also stayed in Joyce Dibali's house, so the knowledge was already with you.   Would you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I knew that Joe knew that as I have already said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...the abduction and assault on Mohabi because what you wanted from him you knew already.   Would you agree to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> How can you say that, they wanted information about his sister, that doesn't mean where she lived, it may well mean when she travels through Johannesburg, when she was next going to be in the country and matters of that nature.   I don't think it's right to put to the witness that "you already knew".</p>

<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Why was it necessary to go and pretend that this man owed you money to drag him out of his house.   Why didn't you simply say you were taking him away for questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Sir the instruction was that this person should be abducted not arrested, so the pretence, we had to take him from there under false pretences not to give anybody the impression that we were policemen taking this man away but that we were ordinary citizens whom he owed money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> So you were not performing a police function at the time, you were acting illegally, that is so isn't it?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Chairman and members of the Committee, again on this matter the next of kin will still be the same woman who was also involved in the other incident, Joyce Dibali and what I've relayed to the Court still applies in this matter as well.   Mr Chairman I don't have any matter in which witnesses are present but yesterday we agreed that there are matters that can be dealt with where witnesses need not be called and this was the three matters; (1) affecting Nofomela, the murder on Mr Lawrence; (2) the shooting at Lindley(?); (3) the killing of the diamond dealer.   I don't know amongst my colleagues who is going to start first, I think Advocate Jansen indicated that he's going to start with one of the last two I've mentioned today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Mr Mpshe, could you kindly for record</p>

<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a>purposes inform the Commission whether you've given all the interested parties notice, all the victims and if so, when should they have been here, yesterday or today or tomorrow, because it may be that they are not interested and wouldn't turn up so we could continue with the cases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Yes Mr Chairman, members of the Committee, that is so if they are not here we will continue with the matters.   What I have been doing, I did even this morning at 6 o'clock I phoned some of the people to whom I had sent notices and they indicated to me that they have received them and I spoke to them last on 11 December 1996 and they indicated that they were going to attend if I sent them notices.   This I have done and they have not shown up.   The two that I phoned today were in the matter affecting the kidnapping of an activist called "General", his full name is Glory Sadibe.   I spoke to his brother-in-law, Minister Joe Modise this morning at 6 o'clock and he said he did receive my notices to him but he has forwarded the notice to the wife of Glory Sadibe, Comrade A, who is in Zimbabwe and he had to come down.   He said he will phone me today to tell whether the wife will come or not.   The one person I phoned is the brother to Japie Maponya who indicated to me that he can only be here tomorrow, after I phoned this morning to confirm whether he received the notice.    May I just mention that all the people that are here that I have mentioned I spoke to them personally first and I can say this to the Committee, I've got returns of service here from the investigative unit.   If the Committee would like to know whom I have informed, I can read all the returns of service, unless if the Committee wants to know about specific persons?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> We accept the undertaking you've given Mr Mpshe, let us proceed with the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Mr Mpshe, before we leave the matter of the Dibali's, you handed to us a letter from Joyce Dibali and she said I would like Dirk Coetzee and his colleagues to tell us what happened to Mohabi Dibali and Joe Ngabi.  What is the status of this request, what happens to it?   I know we have asked the previous applicant Mr Nofomela about what happened eventually to Mr Dibali, he told us what he did tell us.   What is to happen to this request?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> As I spoke to her yesterday when I wanted to find out about her dilemma in speaking, she referred me to the letter which I read and she said I'm just here to listen and to know what happened to these people from their evidence.   That is how far I went with her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Captain Coetzee has never been asked about this, he may throw some light on this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> I indicated to her that the other person, Joe Ngabi I do not have an application for amnesty affecting Joe Ngabi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Does that preclude us from asking Captain Dirk Coetzee what happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> I do not think it precludes the Committee asking them about Joe Ngabi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Speaking for myself I don't think this is an unreasonable request and I don't see any reason why we shouldn't ask Captain Dirk Coetzee about it, after all that is why we invite members of the family and relatives to be here.   If they come here and make reasonable requests, if it is possible to accede to those requests, I think we should try to entertain them.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Yes I agree if that is taken up by the Committee.   Mr Jansen is there any reason why we can't recall Captain Dirk Coetzee to come and answer these questions?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Does the name Joe Ngabi mean anything to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Not at all, I've never met him I've never heard the name and I've never seen him Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Did you have anything to do with the abduction of Mohabi Dibali?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Have you learned at any stage as to what has happened to Mohabi Dibali?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No Mr Chairman, the only thing that I knew that someone was abducted with Almond's private car and the car had to be hidden on Vlakplaas but it was a West Rand Security operation under Captain Jan Coetzee together with one of my men, Captain Koos Vermeulen, which I had no knowledge of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Do you know anything, and I don't confine it to you having any personal contact with it, anything about the detention of Mohabi Dibali in August 1982?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Not at all, it was only in Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, nothing at all in Harare, never.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Is it not possible that other members of Vlakplaas may have been in Harare during this 1981?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Not at all, not at all without my knowledge, that was more the operational area of Section A3 under the command of Brigadier Piet Goosen those days but the more specific A3, Captain Craig Williamson.   The operated most of the times with the Defence Force co-operation into Harare, Zimbabwe, South West Africa or Namibia, Zambia and neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Are there any answers you would like to elicit from Mr Coetzee while he's here?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Just the one.   To what extent were you at the time aware of the activities of the Section A of the Security Police who also had operations in other countries?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> To what extent were you aware of the activities of Section A at the time or thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well only by hearsay evidence as far as the London bombing of the ANC offices, the smuggling of explosives in a diplomatic bag as conveyed to me by Peter Casselton(?), the individual that was involved in the London blowing up of the offices, Craig Williamson himself, the Jeanette Schoon murder and her child Katrina in Angola where a parcel bomb was sent to her, as relayed to me by Craig Williamson and the (indistinct) one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Yes, how did it come about that you got to know of these was it in some formal structure in the police or through informal talks with these people?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a>MR JANSEN	110	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> With informal talks with Williamson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Were you a friend of Williamson at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I was and I've got a quote in the manuscript where I can demonstrate that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Could you possibly just quote it for record purposes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chairman in the manuscript during a departmental trial where I was the accused, he gave evidence to the Presiding Officer to explain to him what this, we've got this different way of talking, a dubious way of talking by for instance saying "make a plan" or and I would say "deal with the person" and he would say "hmm" which will have a complete different meaning in the normal sense of speaking but then Williamson explains to the Presiding Officer he says, officer at the presiding trial and he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a>"It is a very devious way of talking..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> Mr Chairman sorry to interrupt, this on page 22 of the amended...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Sorry yes 22, paragraph 4.3.2.4 Mr Chairman</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a>"It is a very devious way of talking, it is something that security people will understand."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a>and also:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a>"I think for people in the profession people who speak deviously to each other and who have a very intimate rapport with each other, understand intimately, understand very well what is going on in this type of conversation."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a>Craig Williamson at my internal trial on 10 June 1985, Vol 6, page 292-293 of the proceedings.   This was done when he made a recording of a conversation between himself and, him and myself where you had this half completed sentences and</p>

<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a>I stopped when I saw he understood what I was talking about and the same half complete answer would sort of come back.  So he was then explaining to the Presiding Officer and he's talking about a very "intimate rapport" referring to the relationship between him and myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR JANSEN</p>

<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> Mr Chairman as I understood the idea was that we would again start with Mr Coetzee, more particulary two of the matters where we will be leading evidence, that is No's 13 of the application and 14, these are both..the idea was that we lead the evidence...(end of 1a)...page 24 and 27, that are the typed page numbers of the Annexure respectively 24 and 27 and then in the manuscript you will see that the two incidents are dealt with together.   The one being an adjunct to the other one, in other words the diamond dealer starts on page 118, continues through to page 119 that's paragraph 5.4.18 and then...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Give me the page again, diamond dealer starts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> Page 118 to 119 and then it re-starts after a digression into the Lindley shooting incident, it re-starts at page 121.   That's paragraph 5.4.18 where it starts and it starts again at paragraph 5.4.18.20 I think.   The Lindley shooting incident starts at page 119, paragraph 5.4.18.8.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> I don't know if I'm the only person unlucky enough not to have page 118?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> If we may just enquiry as to whether that's a general problem then we'd have to, you don't have it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Yes this is an omission, page 118 is missing.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> Yes, it seems like from all of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> I do have 118.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> It will be page 119 to where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> Yes, it then goes through to, the diamond dealer goes to 119 to paragraph 5.4.18.7 that is where it stops in the meantime.   Then there's a digression on to the Lindley shooting incident from 18.8 on to, the next page deals with the Lindley shooting incident and then on page 121 from 18.20 is the diamond dealer starting again.   Then it's to the end of paragraph 5.4.18 until page 123.   Mr Chairman if I may just enquire from yourself whether we could proceed with the evidence and then at the first adjournment ensure that you have page 118?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Yes you may proceed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I will do 13 first Mr Chairman.   Mr Coetzee in your manuscript and in your application you make reference to the murder of a diamond dealer, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Can you briefly explain to the Committee what gave rise to the killing of this diamond dealer and what was your involvement there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chairman on the farm with me was an askari, Ernest Ramathlala, a Lesotho citizen who was responsible for the first attack attempt on the life of Chris Hani.   He together with David Tshikalanga, Almond Nofomela and Joe Mamasela and there might be others, approached me for a loan of R5 000 to go and buy diamonds in Lesotho for, from the relatives of Ernest Ramathlala who apparently had very good</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a>1b	contacts /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a>MR JANSEN	113	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a>contacts on the mine and some of them working there.   I did then borrow R5 000 from my mother-in-law, Mrs Crause(?) and handed it to them.   It was, must have been towards the end October, beginning November 1981.   Almond, David Tshikalanga and I don't know who else proceeded with Almond Nofomela's private car to Lesotho and returned a day or what later, I'm not sure how long, with five little small diamonds the size of a matchstick, stained, cracked and a little bigger one like the nail of my small finger perhaps, a yellow one which I later learned is called "canary yellow".   To me as a layman I could see that they were cheated if one just thinks of your wife's, the size of that diamond on her ring, engagement ring, and I sent them back to go and give the man's diamonds back and bring my money back.   Joe Mamasela, Almond Nofomela and David Tshikalanga proceeded to Lesotho, whilst the group, the Vlakplaas group as a whole departed for Durban where we were summonsed to do surveillance work.   I must just mention that this was also at the time, it was in November and also at the time of the murder of Griffiths Mnenge.   Again some time later an evening shortly afterwards they returned, Joe Mamasela, Almond and I think David Tshikalanga was also present in a, if I remember correct, a grey-blue Datsun Laurel automatic, with Lesotho registered number plates.   They reported to me that they couldn't get the money back, they lured the dealer out of Lesotho, they then took him to a turn-off, gravel road just to the north of Lindley, the first one after you turn off to Lindley, coming from or in the direction of Johannesburg, a few kilometres down that road in a bluegum plantation, the diamond dealer was shot and killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a>1b	They/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a>MR JANSEN	114	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a>They took his car and apparently waved, whilst this was happening, David Tshikalanga apparently followed in the police bakkie of Almond Nofomela and they waved him on to continue on the road.   I immediately took the car to Sgt Schutter's house who was the Sergeant in charge of the farm, the sort of foreman who had to look after the farm whilst we were on operations, to his private house where I asked him to strip the car of all possible identification and keep it until further notice.   David Tshikalanga and Almond Nofomela then accompanied me in my official car to Lindley.  My concern was that the body might have been discovered in the meantime and I should get to the place as soon as possible.   Joe Mamasela was dropped on the farm if I remember correctly to continue his work with Jan Coetzee in West Rand.   As I say Almond escorted us to or showed us the way to this road just before Lindley, gravel road coming from Johannesburg now, turning off to the right and him and David Tshikalanga went into the bluegum bush.   A few minutes later they arrived dragging a corpse by its pants, at the feet, one at each of the feet, and we bundled him in the dark into a plastic bag that was used or that is used by mortuaries to transport bodies in.   I put him in the back of my official vehicle on my whole armoury that was inside and the three of us continued via Bethlehem, where I put in petrol and signed the petrol book, and on our way to Durban where we arrived the next morning.   I reported in brief to Brigadier Van Hooven and then with his permission, left to get rid of the body.   Almond and David Tshikalanga were left in Durban with the rest of the group whilst Koos Vermeulen, Paul Van Dyk and myself continued towards the Swaziland border to a ruin, the ruins of an old house,</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a>1b	farmhouse /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a>MR JANSEN	115	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a>farmhouse, just to the south of the then so-called Houtkop border post.   We waited there whilst Paul Van Dyk took my car, with the body, Koos Vermeulen and myself whilst Paul Van Dyk continued with my vehicle to Piet Retief to an old Swaziland friend of ours that was working at a garage in Piet Retief, Fred Howells(?).   From him he collected tyres and brought it back to the farm or to this ruin where we were waiting.   A fire was built of tyres and wood and the body in the plastic bag put onto this fire and set alight.  I remember Koos Vermeulen cutting open the bag at a stage and taking out the ID document of Lesotho passport of the guy, of this person, but I have never had a look at it to identify the guy.   We stayed there through the night and burned the body to ashes and returned to Durban the next day.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> The basic motive I assume behind the purchasing of the diamonds was to make a profit at the resale thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct Mr Chairman and if diamonds were to be obtained at this stage, myself would have been involved together with Koos Vermeulen, Paul Van Dyk and Sgt Schutte in the selling and profits of the deal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> The deal itself, the obtaining of the diamonds that you would concede had nothing to do with your work as a security policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Absolutely not Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What was the reason behind fetching the body once it became known to you that the diamond dealer had been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well firstly because of the extreme danger of a very sensitive source like Joe Mamasela being uncovered, his identity, secondly the danger of embarrassing the security</p>

<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a>MR JANSEN	116	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a>police in extreme, which could result if for instance Joe Mamasela and Almond Nofomela and even myself then were charged with illegal diamond dealing or/and murder, that exactly that will happen what happened on the evening of 19 October 1989 when Almond was to be sentenced the next morning on death row and he spoke out about all this illegal government sanctioned hit squads that was going on in the security police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Why did you first pick up the body before seeking advice or reporting the problem to one of your seniors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I knew that was the first priority to pick up all exhibits possible, get then the necessary authorisation and report back or report and feedback and then get rid of the exhibits on command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Why did you report to Van der Hooven and not to Schoon initially?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> There was no time, it was 8 at night when they returned.   The team had already departed for Durban, there was extreme urgency to get hold of that body that same night before the morning, next morning daybreak, and then to proceed to the team in Durban to dispose of the body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What did you expect would be the reaction of Van der Hooven have been once you had told him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well it wouldn't have been the first time that security policemen would have been involved in illegal activities, it was about the greater context in which they work.   In other words criminal activities of members in the security police, and especially Vlakplaas, was very often condoned and dealt with in such a manner to prevent them from speaking out against, about the illegal activities</p>

<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a>MR JANSEN	117	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a>going on at Vlakplaas.   There was for instance murder cases against two askaris, Bobby Modiba and I can't remember who was the other guy at the moment, which was dealt with in such a way that they got off the hook.   There was cases like, I mean the first priority of us in the security police was security police operations.   I suppose if things got out of hand everyday by the same person they would have decided to make a plan with him and I'm sure, as proved after I left, if you become a security police risk like Brian Nungalungwa(?), he's six feet under after being killed and a policeman being found guilty in a trial of his murder.  The Motherwell Four, three policemen and an askari that was involved in illegal activities with the local security police branch who were blown up in their vehicle.   Major Mos who died of a heart attack,  so-called heart attack but I believe there's now ample evidence that it was not a heart attack but things that were given him by the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Yes but under these circumstances what did you expect Van der Hooven to tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> To immediately get rid and cover up of the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What did he in fact tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> To go ahead and get rid of the body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you report the incident to any of your other seniors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did because after dealing with the body I phoned Brigadier Schoon and in brief told him about it and asked him to release Koos Schutte from the farm for two days so that he could bring the car down of the diamond dealer to the Gulela border post, after I have arranged with a person in Durban I think Ebrahim Latief, I think the phone number</p>

<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a>MR JANSEN	118	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a>at the time of Ebrahim Latief it was a well-known source of ours, whilst I was stationed at the Swaziland border, undertook to buy the car for R5 000 and take it through to Mozambique.   Koos Schutte then did bring the car down, fitted with false police, false number plates and licence and third party disks which was printed at the police printing press as explained previously, and a few, a kilometre or two before the Gulela border post Koos Schutte, Captain Koos Vermeulen, Koos Schutte was Sergeant Koos Schutte at the farm, Captain Koos Vermeulen, W/O Paul Van Dyk and myself waited for a short while when Ebrahim Latief, with another unknown gentleman, arrived.   They paid me</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a>R5 000 in cash in front of all the witnesses present, took the car and departed for Swaziland.   I gave the R5 000 back to my mother-in-law and called it a day, told the people to lay off in future of such operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> To which of your other seniors, if any, did you report this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was only Brigadier Van der Hooven and Brigadier Schoon, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What was so sensitive about the fact that Joe Mamasela was working for the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He was at that stage as yet Mr Chairman, not identified yet by anyone, I don't think one will have to ask Jan Coetzee, Captain Jan Coetzee with whom he was working, and I think there is a report available where it is described that it is sensitive.   He was also armed with an illegal unregistered Tokarev, Russian-made pistol and it was of extreme importance that his identity should not be revealed.   He might at that stage have still been with the ANC, infiltrated with the ANC in Botswana, I won't be able</p>

<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a>to tell.   He was for sure not permanently based at Vlakplaas, only since February 1982 when Jan Coetzee had taken over a month before from me at Vlakplaas, Joe Mamasela was permanently transferred to Vlakplaas and sworn in as a policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> Mr Chairman this is the only evidence I intend leading on this incident.   I do, however, wish to draw your attention that during the next incident the Lindley shooting incident, certain documents will be handed in, one document emanating from official sources, specifically dealing with the issue of how sensitive the identity of Joe Mamasela is.  That would then just be on that specific issue would then, I would just ask you to see that as evidence having been led in this application itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Would it not be appropriate that whilst Mr Coetzee is here that you move on to the next item?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> Yes Mr Chairman, yes there was just the one issue that Mr Tshikalanga is also involved in the Lesotho diamond dealer matter.    I would personally suggest that we continue with Mr Coetzee's evidence and then go over to Mr Tshikalanga if that's alright with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Yes I think it would be convenient.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a>these two incidents fit into each other and then continue by explaining what happened at the Lindley incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chairman during the McNally and Harms Commissions of Enquiry after the revelations of Almond Nofomela on 19 October 1981 and after I then went into exile to support the allegations of Almond, Joe Mamasela denied, with his superiors involved - Jan Coetzee then at Vlakplaas, Brigadier Schoon and the police upper echelons, that Joe Mamasela knew me at all.   They said at the time he never came to Vlakplaas and it was impossible for me to have known Joe Mamasela in 1981 because he only came to Vlakplaas in February 1982, more than a month after I've left.   I then described this incident of the Lindley shooting to demonstrate the fact that they were lying and misleading the Harms and McNally Commissions and that Joe did in fact know me, but the whole lot was covering up from top to bottom.   Now this incident at Lindley happened whilst we were working at the Lesotho border, again in the Ladybrand area, and at the time I think it was also in October if I'm not mistaken there is some more specific times, dates available, we were requested to all pull up from all directions, Koos Vermeulen from Western Transvaal, myself from Lesotho, Paul Van Dyk wherever he was and to meet in Middelburg with the Eastern Transvaal regional commander, who was then Brigadier Schalk Visser, after two men were shot in a caravan near Ogies by a so-called ANC cadre.   On our way I drove in my official car, a Datsun, followed - alone - followed by Almond Nofomela driving his bakkie and Joe Mamasela as passenger on the left front seat.   As we came down the hill approaching the Lindley turnoff I could see a yellow and blue two-door Ford Escort vehicle turning in from Lindley town into the</p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a>1b	main /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a>MR JANSEN	121	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a>main road in the same direction that we were travelling, in other words north to Johannesburg, towards Johannesburg.   The vehicle was swerving viciously over the road, the driver had his fist out the window shaking and I pulled up next to him and put on my vehicle's siren to try and pull them off because I could immediately see there was five black men, occupants in the vehicle, two in the front, three at the back and that they were heavily or had been heavily drinking.   As, just after the Lindley turnoff, you come up a hill where they threatened to go over the white line to the right of, in front of oncoming traffic, I gave way to the right for them to enable to come back to the left of the road and the next moment just heard shots and glass flying into my vehicle as I was next to the Ford Escort.   Looking over my shoulder I saw Joe Mamasela hanging out the left front door, emptying his Tokarev pistol on the vehicle.   Eventually on top of the reach at the same gravel turnoff to the left where they took the Lesotho diamond dealer and killed him, the vehicle turned to the left and as I learned later from the passenger, he pulled up the handbrake.   The vehicle came to a standstill and I stopped at the T-junction while Joe and Almond pulled the people in the vehicle out of the car.   Joe of course in a normal manner, kicking karate and fisting them down.   At the time, a Pastor, an Afrikaans Dominee stopped with his wife and asked if everything was okay and I was just worried to get this member of the public away and I said there was nothing to worry about, everything is under control, I was the police and then I stopped the assault and then immediately realised there was trouble.   We got the inhabitants into the car, the bakkie, and we started collecting all possible Tokarev shells that were</p>

<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a>MR JANSEN	122	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a>lying next to the road.   I then handed Almond my 9mm pistol and asked him to pull off a few shots, rounds, and pick up the empty shells and bring it with to the, where was this town, Lindley police station.   We drove to the police station together with the car that was shot at and the inhabitants, I asked Joe to keep a low profile it was already then turning dark, whilst I went into the charge office with  Almond Nofomela and the occupants of the vehicle and arranged for blood tests of the driver to be taken for the injuries, especially the man in the middle back seat, that was sitting in the middle back seat he was wounded in the back to be attended to by the local district surgeon or the doctor who acted as district surgeon.   The left front passenger and the right back seat passenger just light flesh wounds, bullet wounds under the chin.   I immediately rang Brigadier Schoon, reported the matter to him and asked him, and already told him what I did as, if he agrees with what I did by picking up the empty shells and let Almond fire off a 9mm pistol.   He agreed with the suggestion that to keep Joe's identity secret and his involvement that Almond should pretend that he was the guy who actually shot at the vehicle.   I then prepared at the Lindley police station my and Almond's statements and a docket.   We charged the driver of the vehicle for drunken driving.   The back seat passenger was transported to hospital and after that we left for Middelburg where we joined up with the rest of the group.   After I left Vlakplaas on 31 December 1981, and whilst being with Narcotics Bureau in Pretoria, drug squad in Pretoria under Colonel Basie Smit, I was called early January if I'm not mistaken in 1982, maybe towards February, by Brigadier</p>

<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a>Schoon and Brigadier Jan Du Preez at this stage and instructed that I should accompany..(end of 1b)...Van der Merwe, in my manuscript I couldn't remember his name, who had close contact or good contact, whatever one wants to call it, with the Free State Attorney-General, who was Advocate Tim McNally.    This resulted, happened as a result of the Attorney-General of the Free State that decided that Almond Nofomela must be charged because of his shooting on a vehicle where he knew he could have injured innocent people and not specifically the driver.   Almond then refused to take the brunt for Joe.   We went to Welkom police to the Divisional Commissioner's office, we spent the whole day there making some statements, I'm not sure exactly what went, what happened but I know it was in the line of terrorists, possible terrorists in the area and that this was confused with possible terrorists and so, and this was forwarded to the Attorney-General's office in the Free State.    Eventually the case was squashed against Almond, it was withdrawn, the passenger in the middle back seat was paid an amount of R1 500 round about I think and the driver of the vehicle was found guilty of drunken driving.   In documents that I've seen later, I know that is now the Attorney-General's decision to prosecute Nofomela and that happened middle December I think, 1981.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Coetzee is it true that in your initial statements at the Lindley police station you lied about the fact as to who did the shooting, is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Then at a later stage you, after the decision was taken to charge Nofomela, you then again lied by giving this whole incident some kind of a colour relating to</p>

<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well I can't remember whether I again made any statement at Welkom police station, unfortunately the sweepers in the Harms Commission has removed that docket but I'm sure there will be some copies or reports to that effect in the Attorney-General's office of the Free State, but it's quite possible that I did yes.   But it was also quite clear Mr Chairman that things were arranged and we had very little to say, we were actually just waiting outside in the sun for hours on end after a very short meeting with Brigadier Van der Merwe, the Divisional CID Officer.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did these instructions did they emanate from the Security Police and more specifically from yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No, this comes from Brigadier Jan Du Preez, this was a decision and in theory we were on a secret operation next to the Lesotho border but for sure not in the Lindley area.   The exact way in how to cover up came explicitly from Brigadier Jan Du Preez, JA Du Preez, who was the then second-in-charge under General Johan Coetzee in the Security Police Headquarters.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well as I say I had already been transferred at this stage to drug squad, Pretoria, and it was a very short conversation where I was told that this will be the line</p>

<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Why would somebody like Du Preez have involved himself in the cover up of what actually happened at the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well firstly to avoid Joe Mamasela's identity to be blown and secondly to avoid anyone being charged as the result of some conviction which might result in the danger of the illegal activities of the Security Police, like the hit squads being exposed, by the then victim in this case who would have been Almond Nofomela, Mr Chairman.</p>

Then there is a Private Bag No at the top, a reference number, enquiry number Major Ellis, a phone number which is the 017 code, I don't know which area code that is, 4 May 1983, it should be the Welkom because I see the author of the letter is Brigadier JMH Van der Merwe, Divisional Commissioner, Welkom, Brigadier.

If the head of the Security Police had wanted to know the truth, would it have been very difficult to find out from him whether you were actually busy with a secret operation in the Lindley area?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No not at all, in fact he would have known the truth and would have assisted in the covering up.   The only reason Mr Chairman if a source is of some value, a cover-up of this kind would happen if he has no value at all he would be assassinated as happened to many askaris after my time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Was it strange to you or not that the cover-up and the defeating of the ends of justice would seemingly have the approval right up to the top of the Security Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Not at all surprising, common practice I think like was proved in the Harms Commission that even higher up to the Commissioner of Police, former Commissioner of Police Johan Van der Merwe who is admitting and even up to a cabinet level.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Yes, as a security policeman then was your understanding that if there were any judicial problems or any problems from the political side that your colleagues would cover up for you and that you would cover up for them as much as is possible under the circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct with the knowledge and co-operation and contacts of the upper echelons of the police, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> In covering up the Lindley incident and the diamond dealer, was it your understanding that you were in fact performing or doing what was condoned in the wider culture of the Security Police?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was absolutely as proved in the McNally and the Harms Commissions, amongst other things, amongst other Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> They were 100% successful over the years Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Does that apply to politicians as well?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> That's a rather general, I've been a politician myself and I think other people too, to say every politician tried to cover up everything in a general term is severely I think libelous.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> No Mr Chairman, it's with respect not meant as libelous, what is meant is that with their cover-up, lying to politicians and it's not saying that the politicians or the judicial officers were part of the cover up.   What is meant by that answer and the question is that, and specifically relating to this incident, is that the Security Police lived under a culture where they believed that if they covered for each other and lied for each other they would successfully keep the politicians ignorant.   They would successfully keep the judicial officers ignorant, not that they were a party to it.   That is only how it is meant, I think it's the only extent to which it can be</p>

<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Absolutely Mr Chairman, there was a huge massive cover-up, again to the top, and illegal operations of the kind that I'm asking amnesty for escalated dramatically, personnel build-up operationally ten-fold, 100-fold if it was compared to what I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I think Vlakplaas was in fact only closed during 1993 is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct, on 30 April 1993 Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> As an example, you at one stage wrote a letter to the then President, F W de Klerk trying to convince him that he should see a different perspective as to that which he was being briefed with by his Generals, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That was correct Mr Chairman and if I remember correctly it was on 21 February 1992 or 1991, I wrote the letter whilst in exile in London, went to an attorney to do an oath.   It was faxed to the President's office through the newspaper the Sunday Times and the original registered to him by registered mail.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> In the diamond dealer incident the body was disposed of, cover-ups were done.   In the Lindley shooting false statements were given and further cover-ups were done.  I want to put it to you that these things were done in both incidents for the following reasons;</p>

<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> All this was done not to achieve any political objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well Mr Chairman I think the answer is no it was to achieve political objective, but one can just look at the revelations and the National and international outcry on the</p>

<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a>MR MPSHE	132	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a>morning of 20 October 1989 after Almond Nofomela spoke of the Griffith Mninge incident the previous night only, so one can imagine if then some or one or two or more people were charged that were involved in these incidents and they eventually landed up in jail without being assisted in the normal way by the Security Police covering up, and they started spilling the beans in 1981.   It would have had exactly the same effect as it had on 20 October 1989, in other words that date would have been moved eight years forward, earlier if they risked to charge any one of the people involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Surely there's an enormous difference Captain Coetzee between the deliberate assassination of an attorney who is carrying out his business for political reasons and the killing of a diamond dealer who has tried to cheat you by selling you diamonds that aren't worth the money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It is true Mr Chairman that is, but I'm specifically answering the question of Mr Mpshe as far as he related it to me that it was not politically intended, the end result of it, but it's completely different, it's completely private, that's correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Mr Coetzee but the police didn't deny responsibility for paying for instance the victims in the Lindley incident, it was only that they didn't want the identity of the informer or agent to be...but they accepted responsibility for the act as a police act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct as far as the civil law suit was concerned, that is correct but as far as the criminal act of the shooting of Joe Mamasela, which was then moved to Almond Nofomela, that was squashed and covered up Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a>MR MPSHE	133	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> (Inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No there will be, Lindley at that stage still had these old exchanges and I phoned Brigadier Schoon to his house, I think it was a Saturday night, and had a long discussion with him.   I'm sure if records could be traced it will be proved that way and if W/O Heath who was then station commander, at this stage he's on pension but his son is director, (indistinct) Heath who is still with the South African Police Services.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> After phoning did you go back to the scene of the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I can't remember, I think I had already at that stage picked up the empty shells of the Tokarev pistol and fired three shots with the 9mm pistol or Almond, to hand that in as some of the...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> So you decided on that before you were instructed to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did because of the culture of the police, but would not have risked doing it at all with consent from the very, very top because of the magnitude of the possible results that could come out of that if it was not done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Mr Coetzee and you're also referring to the culture of the police, and I think you should let us stick to the Vlakplaas police, because I don't think, or was it the culture of all the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It is a slip of the tongue, I am specifically referring to the culture of the Security Police and more specifically the operational Vlakplaas contingent side of it.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a>two instances which really were purely criminal and had no bearing on anything that would have been to serve any political objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> There was no action taken at all Mr Chairman, records will prove that, there was not even an indication of any possibility of any action taken to him, criminally or departmentally, or against any one of us for that matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Are you advancing the theory that no matter what the Vlakplaas police did, openly criminal activity not related in any way to any political objective, is by you regarded as an overall political objective.   Is that what you are really saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> In a way yes Mr Chairman, if the source is still valuable, if the police individual or police member is still a valuable member it is allowed, it's an open hand and I think it was very clearly indicated in the Eugene De Kock trial recently where it is, there was an absolute open free hand and everything was condoned from the top as being publicly admittednow, in the majority of those cases by the former Commissioner of Police General Johan Van der Merwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1545"><a name="pos1545"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> It may have been condoned but I'm not talking about whether it was rightly condoned or wrongly condoned, I'm looking at the acts that were committed and I'm trying to wrestle with whether those acts can be interpreted in terms of the Act as being related to a political objective.  The evidence that we've heard so far, at least on these two murders, leave me in grave doubt whether they can be described directly as being motivated by a political objective.   For example, the purchase of the diamonds was not political, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> For sure.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Well that's the end of the matter isn't it.   Everything that flows out of that was part of criminal activity by the police, but because they were police of the Vlakplaas Unit, therefore they become political that's what you're saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well the result thereof, the result of charging people on Vlakplaas with criminal matters could end up what happened in 1989 when Nofomela spoke out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> It would mean that the world would come to know about Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> What it would mean that the world would have come to know about Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct and all the security police illegal activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Quite right but that didn't make it a political objective, that just means that the political activities of the police have now been discovered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct, but with great political consequences to the governing party of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> There may be political consequences out of ordinary simple acts as well, but looking at the acts themselves one wants to know whether this can be brought within the ambit of the Act.   This is a matter for argument, no doubt we will hear argument on that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Not at all Mr Chairman, as was proven in the Eugene De Kock trial which resulted in multiple, but multiple illegal criminal activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> If that is the case what makes Joe Mamasela's case special?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> At that time he was a highly sensitive source whose identity could not be revealed and as I said if it was, and it ended up in a criminal court case, it would have had exactly the same result, I think he would have acted exactly in the same manner as Almond Nofomela did on 19 October 1989.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Why did you decide to substitute Mr Nofomela for Mr Mamasela as the person who would have fired the shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Because of the sensitivity, as I already said, of Joe Mamasela being an askari, being infiltrated with the ANC in Botswana, shooting with an unregistered, illegal firearm and if that would have come out it would have been in itself chaotic for the South African Security Police and furthermore if he was charged and he exposed the hit squad activities of the South African Security Police, even so more.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Very difficult to speculate if one says any crime, but I'm sure he would have been spoken to and told to calm down to keep it cool and not proceed with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Where are we to draw the line because he nearly killed people.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> If he had raped a 14 year old girl during that time following the trend of your argument, he would not be prosecuted, apparently the police would have found an appropriate rapist to put in his place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well if...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> They would have said Mr Nofomela did it or someone else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No I don't know what exactly would have happened in that specific case then Mr Chairman, all I can tell what the Security Police needed they could achieve by oppressing whatever charges was against them.   Joe Mamasela for instance was recruited by the Security Police in June 1979, Major Kruger in Krugersdorp prison awaiting a charge of robbery if I'm correct, of robbery.   He then approached the Security Police that he can assist them, opportunist that he is, and they then squashed that case against him and in August he was out working for the Security Police.   He was on a robbery charge awaiting trial in the Kurgersdorp prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Looking at this Lindley incident, if the police deemed it necessary to recruit Joe Mamasela for whatever purpose, and he does certain things, shouldn't the police simply accept the consequences thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Not in the security culture, the main purpose as I described in this same document Mr Chairman, if you would allow me and the answer is a little bit long, I just say I will just come to page 9 of my manuscript where I say</p>

<p class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Could you just tell me where you are reading from please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chairman it's paragraph 1.6 on page 9 of my manuscript under the heading "1 - Introduction" where I have a set out of the Security Police culture etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> So it seems that the overriding concern of you and your superiors was to maintain the integrity of Vlakplaas, to prevent it from being discovered in any way whatsoever, to prevent any of its activities being discovered and that was the sole aim and purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1610"><a name="pos1610"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1611"><a name="pos1611"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> The whole objective was to protect Vlakplaas and its members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's as security police...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> That the objective.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1614"><a name="pos1614"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Yes now I'm talking about whether there's a political objective and it seems that the real objective was not a political objective but the objective was, a structure had been created called Vlakplaas, all kinds of offences were then committed and all things were done to maintain the integrity and identity of Vlakplaas, that was the objective</p>

<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a>of everything that was done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1619"><a name="pos1619"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well Mr Chairman as I say, as a result of the (indistinct) chain, I did not know always how high up did the command come but I think again it is now public knowledge and no secret that Minister Adrian Vlok was at Vlakplaas after the Kotswe House bombing for instance to make it unusable and then was on the farm partying with the members, congratulating them on the operation and then going on TV and blaming the ANC for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> So his activity would be regarded as part and parcel of the culture and activity of Vlakplaas that didn't make it a political objective as such did it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I think one must look at it maybe, with respect,...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1622"><a name="pos1622"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> The fact that a politician does these things doesn't make it a political objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1623"><a name="pos1623"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I think the end result is the Minister of that relative department is a member of the then Government or was and of course it is not Vlakplaas as such but one must see it in the Security Police culture and set-up and if one looks at it that the Security Police is actually the people who advised the Government on security laws and in a way was actually governing this country.   Stringent security laws were made by Parliament on the recommendation, untested evidence of the Security Police about the freedom fighters and the freedom organisations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1624"><a name="pos1624"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Mr Coetzee would you then say that the State Security Council was aware of the then raging culture of deceit and cover-up by the Security Police in relation to their criminal activities which had no relation to the total onslaught against the liberation movements?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1627"><a name="pos1627"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chairman can you just please...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1628"><a name="pos1628"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> I'm just asking if in your opinion the State Security Council was aware of the then raging culture of deceit and cover-up by the Security Police in relation to criminal activities which had no relation to the total onslaught against the liberation movements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1629"><a name="pos1629"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I would not be able to answer that question because I don't know, I never had contact, personal contact with the Security Council at all.   All that made me wonder why didn't they stop all this Vlakplaas operations, why did the criminal activities escalate dramatically, apart from all the other illegal activities as far as security's operations, after....</p>
<p class="line" id="line1630"><a name="pos1630"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> How could they stop it Mr Coetzee if they are not told?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1631"><a name="pos1631"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1632"><a name="pos1632"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> How could they have prevented that if they had not been aware?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1633"><a name="pos1633"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well they could have pleaded no knowledge or, before myself and Almond Nofomela's revelations but for sure thereafter such serious allegations coming from your Security Police people surely people surely must have made the Minister get into his car and drive to Vlakplaas to go and see what is going on on this farm or, instead of going there and congratulating the people on incidents that happened three or four years, I can't remember when was the Kotse House bombing but to sort of go there and party with the guys and congratulate them on it, on their activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1634"><a name="pos1634"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Coming to the diamond dealer murder, did Schoon agree to that cover-up with regard to the disposal of the body?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1636"><a name="pos1636"></a>MEMBER OF COMMISSION	143	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1637"><a name="pos1637"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He did, the radio of the diamond dealer's car was built into Brigadier Schoon's official vehicle, a yellow Cortina with a white (indistinct) top by Sgt Koos Schutte of the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1638"><a name="pos1638"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Did he know this, it's all very well to say it was built into his official car but I get an official car and I don't know where the radio comes from, it's just put there.   Did Brigadier Schoon know where it came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1639"><a name="pos1639"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I say yes Mr Chairman, it's easy for him to deny it and say no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1640"><a name="pos1640"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Why do you say he knew it, we've heard a lot of accusations made by you, I want to know now why you say Brigadier Schoon would have known where the radio in his official car came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1641"><a name="pos1641"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well I made it known to him what happened, Sgt Koos Schutte did build the radio into his vehicle.   Colonel Jack Cronje on Vlakplaas, the Commander, it was after me Captain Jan Coetzee and then a Colonel Jack Cronje came to the farm and then I threatened whilst my phone was tapped and it was admitted in court and that it was tapped and it was illegally tapped during my departmental trial, I told my listeners on the phone, the upper echelons, that the later Chief of the Security Police, Lt Gen Piet Viljoen's wife was monthly drawing the illegal money from a non-existing source for months on end.   I then got a message from Sgt Schutte on the farm that if I would make that public they would, they are threatening to expose the diamond dealer, the Lesotho diamond dealer story.   I said go ahead, I did expose Joan Viljoen's activities, the wife of Lt Gen Piet Viljoen, it's in this manuscript, and up until this day they did nothing from their side as they threatened to do.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1644"><a name="pos1644"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Nothing you have said in your answer, as far as I am concerned, did anything to show that Brig Schoon knew where the radio came from.   You've told us about other people, other threats, other things, who issued him with is official car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1645"><a name="pos1645"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It did go into his official car...</p>

<p class="line" id="line1648"><a name="pos1648"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Was it issued by the Department?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1650"><a name="pos1650"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1651"><a name="pos1651"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes the official car that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1652"><a name="pos1652"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Was it fitted with the radio?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1653"><a name="pos1653"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No it was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1654"><a name="pos1654"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> How did he arrange to have the radio fitted, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1655"><a name="pos1655"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No I haven't got personal knowledge, Sgt Koos Schutte fitted it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1656"><a name="pos1656"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Mr Coetzee also there is no evidence to show that Brigadier Schoon in fact agreed to the cover up.   According to your manuscript on page 123 that's paragraph 5.4.18.28 you phoned Schoon, briefed him on the cover up and then requested that he sent Lt Schutte(?) to bring the car to Gwalela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1657"><a name="pos1657"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's true Mr Chairman, not doing anything about it then resulting of my report, shows that he agreed in covering it up otherwise he would have immediately proceeded with criminal charges against the people involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1658"><a name="pos1658"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Mr Coetzee you were very concerned about Joe's identity, but he went in broad daylight, abducted Mr Umfali(?) and was even recognised by Mr Umfali and Mr Umfali</p>

<p class="line" id="line1661"><a name="pos1661"></a>later reported that Joe who frequently visited their house was the abductor, so then nobody was concerned about his identity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1662"><a name="pos1662"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes Mr Chairman I know that was when he was working with his handler Captain Jan Coetzee of West Rand, what the exact circumstances are, why he sent him in daylight because maybe he was known to the people of the house, maybe he was known as a courier running between Botswana, the house of Joyce Dibali and the house of their relatives in Soweto, I can't say but I'm sure Captain Jan Coetzee will assist in that answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1663"><a name="pos1663"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> He was abducting somebody against his will so it was obvious that he was not acting on behalf of the Dibali's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1664"><a name="pos1664"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well obviously the inhabitants of the house knew him and I can't say in what context did they know him, but I'm sure that it was as a result of his contact in Botswana coming through because he was also transporting arms for the ANC through the border gate, with the knowledge of the ANC, ag with the Security Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1665"><a name="pos1665"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> You always bring in other incidents like the carrying of arms now, but I say they weren't concerned about his identity acting on behalf of the Security Police because he was acting on behalf of the Security Police in abducting Mr Umfali.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1666"><a name="pos1666"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> And in assaulting him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1667"><a name="pos1667"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Ja that's correct Mr Chairman, I can't answer that question I wasn't involved in it, in the decision-making, I don't know the circumstances around the set-up at the house, him knowing the inhabitants of the house and why Jan Coetzee then...</p>

<p class="line" id="line1672"><a name="pos1672"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was at night, it was with the consent of headquarters and his handler so it's quite possible, and he was recognised there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1673"><a name="pos1673"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> In fact yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1674"><a name="pos1674"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1675"><a name="pos1675"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> You sent him in in daylight into Botswana to do the reconnaissance work there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1676"><a name="pos1676"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1677"><a name="pos1677"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Keeping the house under surveillance not being afraid that he would be recognised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1678"><a name="pos1678"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> As I say that is with the consent of his handler and headquarters Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1679"><a name="pos1679"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> So here you were afraid of identifying him because what he was doing wasn't done with the consent of his handlers?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1683"><a name="pos1683"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> So he didn't act in the course of his duty that's why you protected him in the Lindley incident?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1760"><a name="pos1760"></a>saying that is my story and I am prepared to answer questions on it.   We did not succeed in completing it, we only came to a certain page, I think, up until page 125 because the lawyers for Human Rights who made date appointments for the Harms Commission in London did not want to listen to me, did not know what I was up against, and we were forced on to the plane to London and I could not succeed in completing this document.   I only completed it after the Harms Commission in London.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1761"><a name="pos1761"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> How long after you had left the country did you work on that document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1762"><a name="pos1762"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The date on it is 21 April in the beginning, the introduction Mr Chairman I might just refer in the preface on page 6 and 7, the Committee would get the first long piece, signed or printed by my brother Ben Coetzee, dated 21 April 1990, that was the Saturday morning that we landed in London for the Harms Commission to commence on the Monday 23.   I completed it and returned to Zambia on 13 May 1990, after the Harms Commission, when I signed it, dated it and handed several copies out to the ANC and advocates in preparing for other cases, it was never altered, changed.  I think if the Committee might just look at the second part of the preface, where it specifically said, explained how several factors prevented my brother, that's now referring to me, written by my brother Ben</p>

<p class="line" id="line1780"><a name="pos1780"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> This is the attempted murder of Comrade A.  Matter No 8.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1783"><a name="pos1783"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I may  perhaps further add relevant to the letter, Mr Chairman, that after receiving the letter I got in touch with Mr Wagner, the attorney, the author of that letter, and he indicated to me that he can only come at the end of the hearings to make submissions that will be in writing and he will read this into the mike.  He need not come and listen to all the evidence.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1787"><a name="pos1787"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That is so.  W F Schoon is Willem Schoon, who was a security police officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1788"><a name="pos1788"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So it is written on behalf of him, not on behalf of Marius Schoon.</p>

On Friday last in Cape Town I phoned his house once more but I did not find him, I found the son, who then provided me with the full home address and that's when I sent the form 2.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1853"><a name="pos1853"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHIKALANGA:</span> That's when Dirk Coetzee said let's go to the area where they killed him together with Almond because Almond knew where they killed the diamond dealer.  So we went there together, myself and Dirk and we found the corpse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1854"><a name="pos1854"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> You must have realised at that time that what Almond and Joe had done was to commit a murder that had nothing to do with your work at Vlakplaas, is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1860"><a name="pos1860"></a>Almond does not get into trouble.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1861"><a name="pos1861"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHIKALANGA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1862"><a name="pos1862"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Did you think that following Dirk Coetzee's instructions in this regard was part of your duty as a member of Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1863"><a name="pos1863"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHIKALANGA:</span> I can say there's something wrong, because there were many things which were happening.  They used to cover up those things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1864"><a name="pos1864"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> If Dirk Coetzee told you to make a statement about everything - a truthful statement about the incident, will you have done so?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1866"><a name="pos1866"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> If Captain Coetzee had instructed you to in fact not cover up and give a truthful statement, would you have done that?  Would you have followed his orders?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1869"><a name="pos1869"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHIKALANGA:</span> Actually, it was going to be difficult for me because there were so many people who  used to talk a lot who ended up being killed, so it was very difficult.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1885"><a name="pos1885"></a><span class="speaker">MR CHIKALANGA:</span> As far as I am concerned I don't know, because when we went back to Lesotho the diamond was in possession of Almond and Joe Mamasela.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1888"><a name="pos1888"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> You say we tricked him to come with us to South Africa.  Were you not part of the whole plan, the whole operation of getting your money back?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1896"><a name="pos1896"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Mr Chairman, as far as the matters of this applicant is concerned, there is only matter No 4 left, which is the burning of the trucks at Rhodes and the theft of an Audi vehicle in Uitenhage.  In both these incidents nobody was injured, so they do not constitute human rights violations, with respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1897"><a name="pos1897"></a>	Although in the further particulars that you requested from this applicant, you only requested such further particulars relating to the theft of the Audi vehicle in Port Elizabeth.  More particularly the reason therefor was that he referred to a certain part - I am sorry, Mr Chairman, I am wrong there.  It was in the burning of the vehicles that he refers to the affidavit of Mr Dirk Coetzee and does not give the details himself.  I don't know whether you wish me to lead evidence on these two issues or to carry on with the final matter in which this applicant seeks amnesty and that is the matter of Jabu Njowase and the wife (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1898"><a name="pos1898"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Yes, I think we should carry on with item No 7 and that is the murder of Njowase and his wife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1899"><a name="pos1899"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Mr Chairman, also as I understood, that's the matter where there would be a mere confirmation of the evidence, so that would then conclude this applicant's evidence.</p>

It follows very much the same pattern as many of the other incidents.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2012"><a name="pos2012"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> No re-examination, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2013"><a name="pos2013"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Before this witness steps down, are there any other matters relating to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2014"><a name="pos2014"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Mr Chairman, yes, there is just the one problem and that relates to the query that was forwarded to Mr Chikalanga relating to his application where he just refers to Mr Coetzee's application instead of stating things himself.  There has been no answer to the Committee's request on that.  What happened since the last - Mr Chikalanga has basically effectively been without representation since the last hearings.  I don't know whether I should deal with that by way of oral evidence or just by way of submitting an affidavit before the end of this session of the hearings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2015"><a name="pos2015"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Which particular item do these relate to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2016"><a name="pos2016"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Mr Chairman, if I can refer to the letter dated</p>
<p class="line" id="line2017"><a name="pos2017"></a>21.3B	28/...</p>

<p class="line" id="line2019"><a name="pos2019"></a>28 October 1996 by the honourable Committee.  It asks certain questions relating to the application and then it says:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line2020"><a name="pos2020"></a>"With reference to page 7 para A4 kindly be advised that in accordance with the promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995, as amended, the applicant must make full disclosure and cannot refer to someone else's application form".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line2021"><a name="pos2021"></a>In other words, that neither the further particulars sought in respect of paragraph 5A(4) has been answered at this stage.  Personally I would submit that we should deal with the matter just by way of submitting a further affidavit before the close of the session.  If, of course, Mr Chairman, with respect, you are of the view that both those incidents, theft of the vehicle and the burning of the vehicles, do not require any evidence as such. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2022"><a name="pos2022"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Mpshe, what is your reaction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2023"><a name="pos2023"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, just to inform my learned friend and perhaps the Committee.  These two matters are some of the matters whereupon we have agreed that these are matters of non-gross violation of human rights and these are some of the matters that will be dealt with in chambers.  The letter that he is reading from is a letter that was asking for information for chamber purposes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2024"><a name="pos2024"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Very well, then.  In order for it to be dealt with adequately in chambers we will require the affidavit which you will make available to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2025"><a name="pos2025"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.  Then that concludes the evidence of this applicant.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2030"><a name="pos2030"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, we even compiled matters that are not for hearing in Bundle 4.  I think my learned friend also has that letter.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2055"><a name="pos2055"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.  The first matter then is No 5 on typed page 8 of the affidavit.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2082"><a name="pos2082"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Mr Chairman, the witness has already confirmed the contents of this paragraph now, so I will move on to the next paragraph which is paragraph 6 on typed page 10 of the application.  Mr Nofomela, this paragraph deals with an attack on unknown persons in Swaziland in approximately November 1985, again under the command of Colonel Cronje.  Do you confirm the contents of this paragraph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2083"><a name="pos2083"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2084"><a name="pos2084"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> The next paragraph is paragraph 8 on page 13 of your application.  It deals with a shooting incident in Lamontville near Durban, also referred to as Chesterville, where you dropped off certain persons who went into the township where a shooting incident took place.  Do you confirm the contents of this paragraph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2085"><a name="pos2085"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2086"><a name="pos2086"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Paragraph 9 on page 15 deals with an incident near Amsterdam in the Eastern Transvaal in approximately 1985 or 1986, where you were involved in a shooting incident with Major Eugene de Kock and others, do you confirm the contents of this paragraph?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2090"><a name="pos2090"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Excuse me, just for the sake of clarity.  In paragraph 8, is it or is it not the same matter in which Mr Mpshe told us that initially people could not, the victims could not be identified and they have now since been identified or can now be identified, or is it a different matter, or a different incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2091"><a name="pos2091"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Mr Chairman, this is the incident that was discussed in chambers yesterday, and the decision was that it will be dealt with in the Durban area if there is an application later by Mr De Kock in this regard, since the evidence that this applicant can give only deals with him driving the people who committed the actual shooting to the area and that he cannot give any evidence with regard to the killings itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2092"><a name="pos2092"></a>	Mr Chairman, paragraph 10 was not included in the list as well.  I notice it now and according to Mr Mpshe, this witness could also not be traced and will not be here in September.  For that reason that can also be included in this list of incidents where the evidence or the application is only confirmed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2093"><a name="pos2093"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman and members of the Committee, in respect of matter No 10, that one of the man called September, I could not or I was not in a position at all to can trace the next of kin inasfar as this person September is concerned, and as a result we came to the conclusion that it can be dealt with as a confirmatory.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2099"><a name="pos2099"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Has the Commissioner of Swaziland Police been notified of this application?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2101"><a name="pos2101"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Shouldn't he have been?  Are they not interested?  There is an allegation that the prisoner was abducted from police cells by arrangement with the Commissioner of the Swaziland Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2102"><a name="pos2102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I did not see it in that light and that is why I did not inform him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2103"><a name="pos2103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> There was evidence in a previous hearing, was there not, in which it was said that the Commissioner of the Police in Swaziland was susceptible to the influence of the South African Security Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2104"><a name="pos2104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, there was by one applicant Dirk Coetzee, that he actually was operating with them.   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2105"><a name="pos2105"></a>	Mr Chairman, I just want to correct a mistake I've made here about the victim September.  I thought we were talking about General, because they are using code numbers.  September I said we could not trace them.  That is not true.  I have just checked on my notes.  September's relatives I did trace.  September's full names are Glory Sedibe.  In this matter I contacted, as I indicated this morning, the Minister of Defence, Joe Modise, who is the brother-in-law to September, and I subsequently learnt that actually the wife to Minister Joe Modise is a sister to September and I spoke to her as well.  This was on 11 December 1996.  The sister to September, that is Mrs Jackie Modise, agreed that I can send Form 2 to her as the sister, which then was done.  This morning at 6 in the morning I phoned Mr Joe Modise's</p>

<p class="line" id="line2108"><a name="pos2108"></a>house to find out when are they available.  Mrs Jackie Modise said to me that she will not attend but she has deemed it necessary to forward the amnesty Form 2 to Glory Sedibe, that is September's wife, who is presently in Zambia and she continued and stated that Glory Sedibe, who is September, has a brother who is currently in the Transvaal, but she does not know the address nor the telephone number.  The other brother knows the particulars and this will be forwarded to me and this has not been done.   That is all, Mr Chairman. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2109"><a name="pos2109"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I note that the applicant says in his application</p>

<p class="line" id="line2161"><a name="pos2161"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Colonel Cronje, Paul van Dyk, Major De Kock.  I do not remember the other two from Ermelo, they were white.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2163"><a name="pos2163"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2164"><a name="pos2164"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> What was the purpose of going to Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2165"><a name="pos2165"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> The intentions were to go and corner people who were sleeping at night.  It was planned that some would enter and others would wait outside and the ones waiting outside would shoot whoever tried to escape and those inside the house would shoot the occupants.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2171"><a name="pos2171"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.   The person escaped by a window from what I heard from Geoff and Geoff chased that person and I shot at Geoff thinking that Geoff was the person trying to escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2172"><a name="pos2172"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Do you know why these people were attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2173"><a name="pos2173"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> From what I was told, I was told that they were members of the ANC living there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2174"><a name="pos2174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Who told you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2175"><a name="pos2175"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Colonel Cronje said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2176"><a name="pos2176"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr Marais, I suppose you are going to enlighten us during argument as to what the purpose is of asking for amnesty, for example in respect of this particular incident.  Because it seems to have happened exclusively or wholly in Swaziland, and I don't know whether amnesty can immune him against Swazi prosecution.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2177"><a name="pos2177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I am sure we will deal with that in argument.  If the conspiracy to murder took place in South Africa, I would imagine that the charge could be brought in South Africa, and I would also imagine that it can affect later extradition proceedings if that would be required if amnesty was granted in South Africa, but I have not looked into that in detail at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2178"><a name="pos2178"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Will you please have a look at item No 8, this is the Lamontville killings, and turn to page 14.  What were you required to do, you and your friends on that occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2179"><a name="pos2179"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> The instruction I received was that I should transport people to a certain bridge where I was to remain behind with Eugene de Kock and Geoffrey Bosigwo, I cannot remember the others, but where we dropped them off they were to proceed from.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2183"><a name="pos2183"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> It is not something that emanated over a short period of time.  These people used to go there from time to time to Lamontville or Chesterville, I am not sure what place it is, but they used to go there often under the pretence that they were ANC people so that they could give weapons to people that they  met there and politicise with them and on a certain day they were to go there and shoot them and that's the day Geoff and I accompanied them with Eugene de Kock and other white people and some blacks as well and we went to this bridge.  And after a while we heard gunshots and we went back to our base at C R Swart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2184"><a name="pos2184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> ... people were targeted, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2185"><a name="pos2185"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I cannot say but there were approximately 10 people from Vlakplaas and others that were assigned to this specific mission, I know some of them, but I cannot remember the others.  Even those who were shot, I don't know how many of them there were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2186"><a name="pos2186"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You say the men who had been sent to the meeting returned and reported to Major De Kock that the mission had been successful.  By this I understood that the target persons had been killed.  Did they not say how many people they killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2187"><a name="pos2187"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I only heard after a while that there were people killed and there were some who escaped.  But when they came back they did not say whether everyone had died or whether there were any survivors.  They just came back and said that they had executed the mission and then we left.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2210"><a name="pos2210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> The question was you don't remember it happened or it did not happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2211"><a name="pos2211"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> As far as I can recall, Sir, no such thing happened.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2225"><a name="pos2225"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I can dispute it, Sir, because the incident involving this PAC member was also in 1986 and it seems to have been more or less at the same time as the September incident, and I remember receiving money for the PAC member incident, but I do not remember being remunerated for the September incident.  That is why I can dispute having been rewarded.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2227"><a name="pos2227"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> The reason for that is because I received one payment and both these incidents took place in 1986, that is why I dispute the fact that I was remunerated for that because I remember this one incident.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2259"><a name="pos2259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> In terms of the Act on the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation, there is a procedure in terms of section 31 that has to be complied with before any person can be compelled to give evidence that might incriminate him.  I have pointed this out to the witness and also the provision in subsection 3 that an incriminating answer given may not be used in criminal proceedings against him and the witness in this case has indicated to me that he is willing to assist the Committee and will answer the question put to him by the member.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2261"><a name="pos2261"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Nofomela, can I then pose my question again to you, are you ready?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2262"><a name="pos2262"></a><span class="speaker">MR A NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2263"><a name="pos2263"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I want to know why in October 1981, when you went back to Lesotho on the advice or the instructions of your commander then, Mr Dirk Coetzee, to return the diamonds and get the refund of the money you had paid for the diamonds in the sum of R5 000, you then decided not to insist the refund of the money, but to get that diamond dealer to come down to the country, to South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2264"><a name="pos2264"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> It was not the intention to trick him not to get the money.  Initially we tried to get the money but we saw that he was hesitant and realised that he did not have the money and we saw that he wasn't playing the game and then we looked at the car he was travelling in and found that it was valuable and if we could get the car from him and sell the car we would get the equivalent of the money we had given them.  That is why we decided to tell him that we</p>

<p class="line" id="line2266"><a name="pos2266"></a>MS KHAMPEPE	187	MR A NOFOMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line2267"><a name="pos2267"></a>should rather go back to South Africa and discuss this because we are not from here and that is when we decided to go to Ladybrand and when we got there we left with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2268"><a name="pos2268"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Did you ask for your refund of your money from the diamond dealer whilst you were in Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2269"><a name="pos2269"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> We did speak about the fact that the diamonds weren't with the money that we had paid him and he hesitated and he gave us stories telling us to wait and telling us about other people whom we didn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2270"><a name="pos2270"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> But you are not responding to my question.  Had you asked for the refund of your money whilst you were there in Lesotho?  Did you demand a refund from the diamond dealer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2271"><a name="pos2271"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> We told him that we want to give these fake stones back and we want our money back and this is when he started telling us about other people.  I do not remember whose names he mentioned, saying that we should wait for them and he gave us a lot of stories that we could see weren't very clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2272"><a name="pos2272"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Thank you, Mr Nofomela, for enlightening us on that issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2273"><a name="pos2273"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Nofomela, continuing with that.  You said you saw the car was valuable and could be sold and through selling the car you could get back your money.  When did that occur to you, this plan of taking the car and selling the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2274"><a name="pos2274"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Joe and I discussed that amongst ourselves that the way this guy's talking now we are not going to get anything out of him and Joe and I were discussing the car saying that the car seems valuable and we agreed we were going to cheat him into coming to Ladybrand with us.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2288"><a name="pos2288"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I want you to look at page 21, please where you set out how you participated in this mission in Swaziland.  My only question to you is, were you armed as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2289"><a name="pos2289"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2290"><a name="pos2290"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Did you use your weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2291"><a name="pos2291"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2292"><a name="pos2292"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> What was the extent of your participation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2293"><a name="pos2293"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Myself and Jonas Mbelo(?) were standing guarding, covering those who had gone inside.  We were standing outside near the door.  We stood near the door when they went in.  I made a mistake where I said that we went in.   We did not go in.  Mbelo and I remained outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2294"><a name="pos2294"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I asked whether you used the weapon and you said yes.  Did you use it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2295"><a name="pos2295"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I did not use the firearm that I had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2296"><a name="pos2296"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> So was it a mistake just now when you said you did use it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2297"><a name="pos2297"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes, it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2298"><a name="pos2298"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> How did you manage to make that kind of</p>

<p class="line" id="line2301"><a name="pos2301"></a>mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2302"><a name="pos2302"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Because we did not go into the house.  The mistake that I made was saying that we went into the house saying that they kicked the door and we went in.  We in actual fact stood outside guarding those that had gone into the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2303"><a name="pos2303"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Were you aware at all times that you never entered the house, that you stood outside, but when my brother asked you, you said that you did use your firearm.  If you had been standing outside the house all the time, how do you manage to make a mistake that you used your firearm in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2304"><a name="pos2304"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Can I correct that?  It is not what you said.  You were asked whether you were armed and you said I used my weapon.  Was your weapon a firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2305"><a name="pos2305"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I did not use my firearm at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2306"><a name="pos2306"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> That was the weapon you had.  It was a firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2307"><a name="pos2307"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I was armed with a 9mm firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2308"><a name="pos2308"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Can I go back to my question.  I want to understand the basis of your mistake.  If you were at all times that you were standing outside the house and you never went in, how do you manage to make the mistake that you used your firearm in the house, if you were never in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2309"><a name="pos2309"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I am trying to correct the error where I included in my statement that I went in, when in actual fact I did not enter the house, I did not shoot, and that is how I remember that I did not use my firearm because I did not go into the house.  And due to the fact that I did not enter the house I did not use my firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2310"><a name="pos2310"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> There aren't many incidents before us in</p>
<p class="line" id="line2311"><a name="pos2311"></a>21.1 - 4B	which/...</p>

<p class="line" id="line2313"><a name="pos2313"></a>which you personally shot anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2314"><a name="pos2314"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> There are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2315"><a name="pos2315"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> In most instances either you were there outside or you took people there.  Which incident is it where you actually shot anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2316"><a name="pos2316"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> As I said Sir, where I was with Major De Kock and the group from Ermelo and Colonel Cronje, where we went to shoot people in Swaziland in 1983.  I practically emptied the whole magazine on a wrong person, someone that accompanied me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2317"><a name="pos2317"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Just tell us where did you stand when you didn't enter the house, where were you when your compatriots went into the room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2318"><a name="pos2318"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> They entered by kicking down the door and we were instructed that we should stand next to the house, myself and Johannes Mbele, near the door, one on either side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2319"><a name="pos2319"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> (Inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2320"><a name="pos2320"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2321"><a name="pos2321"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And this happened at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2322"><a name="pos2322"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2323"><a name="pos2323"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Can you explain to me how it is that you said inside we found three inhabitants sleeping?  How did you find three inhabitants sleeping when you were outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2324"><a name="pos2324"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> That is what Van Dyk related to me when he came out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2325"><a name="pos2325"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> But this doesn't say that.  This says that "we entered the house" and you say "inside we found three inhabitants sleeping".  Now you can understand ordinary common English and you know what that means.  ... three inhabitants sleeping if you were outside and Van Dyk</p>
<p class="line" id="line2326"><a name="pos2326"></a>21.1 - 4B	would/...</p>

<p class="line" id="line2328"><a name="pos2328"></a>would come and tell you there were three inhabitants sleeping.  One gets the feeling that you are not being frank with this Committee, that you are withholding information or misleading us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2329"><a name="pos2329"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Sir, it could appear so because I made the mistake in making the statement to my attorney because I notice now that in this incident, this incident in which I was involved, did not take place as in this statement and that is why I thought I would rectify that mistake now because it did not take place as I said in the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2330"><a name="pos2330"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You emptied your gun shooting at your colleague, that was Geoff standing outside with you guarding outside in another incident, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2331"><a name="pos2331"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2332"><a name="pos2332"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> How far from you was he standing when you started firing on him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2333"><a name="pos2333"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> He was quite a distance from me and it was dark and I could not see that it was him and I just fired and I struck him in his foot and he says that he survived by lying flat and shouting to me that it was him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2334"><a name="pos2334"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Apart from that incident you were asked when did you actually fire shots at people on any of the operations.  Could you tell us where did you actually participate in shooting and did you ever kill anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2335"><a name="pos2335"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes, I have killed someone.  In Amsterdam where we were waiting for people at the border gates coming from Swaziland and that's where we lay 500 ... from the ... border gate in the direction of Amsterdam.  When these people passed the instruction which we received from Eugene de Kock was that we shouldn't do anything because they were on their way to go and give weapons to people up ahead and</p>

<p class="line" id="line2337"><a name="pos2337"></a>ADV DE JAGER	192	MR A NOFOMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line2338"><a name="pos2338"></a>when they approached we came nearer to the fence and we shot them on their way back and that is where I remember shooting one of them - shooting and killing one of them - and another one fell and dropped his gun and he was injured and we tried to trace him all day but we couldn't find him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2339"><a name="pos2339"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> The incident marked No 12 in your application, that is the attack on the ANC members in Swaziland, you stated that it was Major De Kock and Lieutenant Van Dyk who did the shooting.  Now in which part of the house were the three persons shot by Major De Kock and Lieutenant Van Dyk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2340"><a name="pos2340"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I would say from what Van Dyk told me, the position of the house is as Van Dyk explained it to me, and that is how I wrote it here.  That is why I say that that is the reason for the error - that is the error I made.  Thus I ask if you would please allow me to explain it - to accept it in the way that it actually happened, not in the way that I mistakenly put it  in here.  I did not go into the house.  How the people were sleeping or where they were found is what Van Dyk told me.  I was actually supposed to say in my statement that Van Dyk told me this, that and the other, not to create the impression that I saw them or to create the impression that I went into the house because I did not enter the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2341"><a name="pos2341"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> You did not in fact witness the shooting.   You were merely told by Mr Van Dyk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2342"><a name="pos2342"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2343"><a name="pos2343"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2344"><a name="pos2344"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I want you to look at page 23 starting at the foot of page 22, where you set out the nature and particulars of what happened.  You describe how, at the top of page 23, you started assaulting him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2347"><a name="pos2347"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes, I can see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2348"><a name="pos2348"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You went there to kidnap this member of the PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2349"><a name="pos2349"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2350"><a name="pos2350"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And you approached him and requested him to accompany you and after he refused you assaulted him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2351"><a name="pos2351"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2352"><a name="pos2352"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Did you tell him why you wanted him to accompany you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2353"><a name="pos2353"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> We did not tell him where we were taking him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2354"><a name="pos2354"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> So then this whole business of asking him to accompany you is so unrealistic.  You say you approached the target and you requested him to accompany you and after he refused you stated assaulting him.  So you didn't tell him why you wanted him to accompany you, you didn't tell him at all, because you went there to kidnap him.  That's right, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2355"><a name="pos2355"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> That is correct, we did not tell him why we wanted him to accompany us.  When we got to where we had taken him that is where he heard why we had abducted him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2356"><a name="pos2356"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Then after he had been taken to the security office in Piet Retief, this man was further assaulted and interrogated, that's correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2358"><a name="pos2358"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And you took part in that further assault and interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2359"><a name="pos2359"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2360"><a name="pos2360"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> It seems that you got some pleasure out of doing this kind of thing using violence on people who are utterly helpless when you are in the company of others who are armed and you beat this person up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2361"><a name="pos2361"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> It is not that I took pleasure in that.  It is</p>

I had to force him to come with me because I had gone there to abduct him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2365"><a name="pos2365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And after he was abducted and taken away my question was then you further assaulted him and interrogated him and I am saying to you judging from the statements you've made you seem to have had no difficulty in going around assaulting people, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2366"><a name="pos2366"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> When I was present and something like that was being done at the time I was also to participate, not that I enjoyed it, I was merely doing what everyone else was doing.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2368"><a name="pos2368"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I heard from Eugene de Kock that this person was eventually killed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2384"><a name="pos2384"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> At that house where we were assaulting him in Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2385"><a name="pos2385"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Is it correct that Mr Dirk Coetzee accompanied you and that he joined in the attempt to try and overpower this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2386"><a name="pos2386"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2387"><a name="pos2387"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And the two of you couldn't succeed in overpowering him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2388"><a name="pos2388"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes, we didn't succeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2389"><a name="pos2389"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> May I take you back to the assault on ... Mkize, which is item 15 where you proceed to 18, page 24.  I notice that you are telling us that you assaulted this person after he came into the Republic of South Africa on a false identity document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2390"><a name="pos2390"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2391"><a name="pos2391"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Why should a person who comes into South Africa on a false identity document be assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2392"><a name="pos2392"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> The reason for assaulting him was when we met up with him and - when we apprehended him and questioned him we found that he had an illegal passport and there was no identify document to prove that he was a citizen from here</p>

<p class="line" id="line2394"><a name="pos2394"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE	196	MR A NOFOMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line2395"><a name="pos2395"></a>and then Sergeant Van Heerden who was the immediate commander then while Coetzee was the weekend off, he had gone to Piet Retief, he said that we should put him into the vehicle and take him to a plantation near Piet Retief.  He was in his own vehicle, and when we got there he started assaulting him and started questioning him. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2396"><a name="pos2396"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> But where is any politics about it?  When a man comes into the country with a false document and then he is assaulted, what political purpose does it serve, the assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2397"><a name="pos2397"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I cannot say.  I also don't know, but it happened that he was assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2398"><a name="pos2398"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And you go on to say that after he was assaulted you took him to a panelbeating premises where he was burnt with a welding torch  on his chest and face.  What was the purpose of doing this, of going to this extent of burning him with a welding torch on his chest and face?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2399"><a name="pos2399"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Those are the  decisions taken by Van Heerden.  He was the one who said we should take him to this panelbeating shop and he took this welding torch and he scared him with it and that was after he had been assaulted.  I cannot answer those questions.  Those were his decisions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2400"><a name="pos2400"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Did you take part in this process of burning him with a welding torch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2401"><a name="pos2401"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I did not participate.  None of us others that were there.  Only Sergeant Van Heerden did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2402"><a name="pos2402"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Didn't you hold him when the sergeant burnt him?  He couldn't have done it alone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2403"><a name="pos2403"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> He did do it.  In fact, as far as the burning goes, I had a bit of a problem because in the ... (section missing - CHANGE OVER TO TAPE 5A) ... taking him to the</p>

<p class="line" id="line2406"><a name="pos2406"></a>panelbeating shop he was very weak and I made a mistake by saying the person was burnt.  In fact, he was threatened with being burnt by the flame from the welding torch.  He was not burnt.  Because I actually testified before the Harms Commission that this person was not actually burnt, he was merely threatened with the welding torch flame.  That was a mistake that I made to say that he was actually burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2407"><a name="pos2407"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You are very pertinent here.  You are not saying that he was threatened.  You actually say that he was burnt and subsequently he sued the police and the matter went to court.  You are not saying that he was threatened.  Either you saw a person being burnt or you didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2408"><a name="pos2408"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> It seemed as if he was being burnt, because the flame was held close to his face, close to his body, because when you press this button the flame shoots forward and he cried out as though he had actually burnt and he was bleeding as well and I merely assume that he had burnt due to the extent of his injuries, whereas in actual fact he had not burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2409"><a name="pos2409"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> .... assume that he was burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2410"><a name="pos2410"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I assumed that because he was badly swollen in his face and chest and one couldn't see exactly what had been done to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2411"><a name="pos2411"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> (Inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2412"><a name="pos2412"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Because of the way that the flame was being brought close to him and the way he cried out, it seemed as if he had actually been burnt by the flame, but he had actually not been burnt.  But afterwards I never checked him to see whether he had burnt or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2413"><a name="pos2413"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Here once more it is a mistake on your part now to say that the man was burnt.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2417"><a name="pos2417"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And all this was done because the man had entered the country without a valid passport, is that it and a false identify document.  That's the reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2418"><a name="pos2418"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2419"><a name="pos2419"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Tell me a little bit more about this man, please, Paris Mkize.  Where was he from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2420"><a name="pos2420"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I think there is a place called Kraaifontein near Piet Retief.  He was from Swaziland, in fact, according to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2421"><a name="pos2421"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Were they living at Kraaifontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2422"><a name="pos2422"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> According to him his father was a community leader at Kraaifontein.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2424"><a name="pos2424"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2425"><a name="pos2425"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You said in your application for amnesty that he was apparently the son of a community leader, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2426"><a name="pos2426"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I did say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2427"><a name="pos2427"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So this was a man that had quite clearly very strong ties in South Africa, is that so?  His father was a community leader at Kraaifontein.  You have told us that, haven't you?  So he had strong ties with Kraaifontein, his father lived there.  He was not some strange foreigner who had no connection with the country, was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2428"><a name="pos2428"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2429"><a name="pos2429"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was he a South African?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2437"><a name="pos2437"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes, I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2438"><a name="pos2438"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Was that why you assaulted him and threatened him with a blow torch and things of that nature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2439"><a name="pos2439"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> That is one of the things, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2440"><a name="pos2440"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Well, why didn't you mention one word of it earlier in your evidence today?  You made no mention of the fact that he was the son of a community leader who might have been associated with the broader democratic movement?  You didn't tell us a word of that, why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2441"><a name="pos2441"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I was not being asked about this today here and there was no need for me to answer on another topic when I was not being specifically asked about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2442"><a name="pos2442"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You were asked what political purpose was to be achieved by assaulting him and you said you couldn't say.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2443"><a name="pos2443"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2444"><a name="pos2444"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> ... it may have been because his father was an enemy of the State.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2445"><a name="pos2445"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I say that was one of the reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2446"><a name="pos2446"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Community leaders were often associated with a broad democratic movement.  It didn't mean that every community leader belonged to the democratic movement.  So community leaders were associated, some of them, with a broad democratic movement, and because they were associated with a broad democratic movement, some community leaders, this man was the son of a community leader, was treated the way you treated him.  Now where is the politics involved in all this?  This is sheer brutality, where you started assaulting him without knowing at that stage that he was a</p>

<p class="line" id="line2448"><a name="pos2448"></a>CHAIRMAN	200	MR A NOFOMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line2449"><a name="pos2449"></a>community leader's son, you assaulted him and you beat him up because he didn't have proper papers or suspected that he didn't have.  You then say that he told you that his father was a community leader.  So it was after he told you that his father was a community leader, you then say community leaders were often associated.  So when you started beating him up at that stage you didn't know anything about his father's supposed political affiliations.  That's true isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2450"><a name="pos2450"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2451"><a name="pos2451"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> So then your application for amnesty for this incident quite clearly cannot be said to be motivated properly because there was no political objective to be achieved in beating this man up.  You beat him up because he didn't have the right documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2452"><a name="pos2452"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes, Sir.  That is where we started assaulting him without knowing anything about him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2453"><a name="pos2453"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I want to go back now again to the attempted kidnapping of the General.  You told us that you and Captain Dirk Coetzee went to Swaziland for the purpose of kidnapping him, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2454"><a name="pos2454"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2455"><a name="pos2455"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And you assaulted him and left him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2456"><a name="pos2456"></a>How did you get into the flat that he was in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2457"><a name="pos2457"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Firstly, it was dusk when we got there.  It was quite dark already, and we first got into a BMW that was outside and hid ourselves there.  I cannot remember when we moved from there, but we gained access into the flat via a window and we stood somewhere near the toilet so that we could see when he came to the toilet, and if he happened to come to the toilet we were going to grab him and leave with</p>
<p class="line" id="line2458"><a name="pos2458"></a>201	MR A NOFOMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line2459"><a name="pos2459"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> him and we were unable to do that.  While we were standing there, he came to the toilet and we tried to grab him, but he resisted and he was not, as we expected him.  We expected him to have been intoxicated, but he was not, because there was something that was thrown in his drink.  His drink was supposed to have been spiked in order to aggravate his intoxication, and we found that things didn't work out that way.  This person was very strong and he resisted, to such an extent that Captain Dirk Coetzee said that we should leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2460"><a name="pos2460"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Who was going to throw something in his drink to spike his drink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2461"><a name="pos2461"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> As far as I know, from what I was told by Dirk Coetzee, there was a person known as Lockwood(?), who was a friend of the General, and that day there were two of them, and he was going to throw something in his glass so that when he drank, when he consumed that alcohol it would aggravate his intoxication far more than the normal drink and that would have made it easier for us to abduct him.  And it did not happen that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2462"><a name="pos2462"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Who was his driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2463"><a name="pos2463"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I do not remember anything about him, but I heard later from Dirk Coetzee that his driver was there and he was more drunk than anyone else there.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2474"><a name="pos2474"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> When was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2475"><a name="pos2475"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> In 1986 in Ladybrand.  We took him to the Ladybrand Hospital.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2479"><a name="pos2479"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> From what I heard from my commander, Dirk Coetzee at the time, he spoke about General Neethling at the time.  I do not know, I have never seen him.</p>

I thought it was going to be Deetlefs from Ermelo, because he was someone I had become accustomed to, but I wasn't sure if it was going to be him.  We went through the border gate, I think I was in front, and they came behind.  We were travelling in one car.  After we had been defeated by General my tackie slipped off my foot because he was biting me and trying to drag me in, he did not want me to go, and I said to Dirk Coetzee this guy is biting me and he said well bite him back and I bit him on his head and he left me and I hit him with my fists and I took my shoe and put it back on and got into the car, into the BMW that was outside and from there I ran to the car that was waiting in the street.  We got into the boot, Mr Coetzee and I, when we got to the border gate.  The person driving did not have any problem about the vehicle being searched.  We remained in the boot until we got through both border gates, until we got to Oshop(?) border gates and then he came and he opened up the boot for us to get out. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2485"><a name="pos2485"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I will ask the question again, Mr Nofomela.  What role did Mr Coetzee state you were going to play when you were still in South Africa, prior to departing for Swaziland?  Were you advised on how you were going to kidnap Mr General?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2486"><a name="pos2486"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> He said that we were going to go in because this person was going to be drunk, so we were going to carry him out, I was going to assist him in carrying him.

<p class="line" id="line2543"><a name="pos2543"></a>	Mr Chairman, you will notice on the typed page 11 that the application is for amnesty with regard to the offence of murder.  That is incorrect in the case of this applicant, and amnesty is sought with regard to the offence of kidnapping.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2544"><a name="pos2544"></a>	I will also at a later stage in these proceedings come to an explanation on how this affidavit was drafted and why there are certain matters like this specific instance which is not correct.

<p class="line" id="line2545"><a name="pos2545"></a>	Mr Nofomela, how did you get involved in the kidnapping of a person by the name of Japie Maponya?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2546"><a name="pos2546"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I was at Vlakplaas at the time under the command of Eugene de Kock and he was my commander.  He called Johannes Mbelo and I and said to us that there was someone whom we should go and abduct in Krugersdorp.  He even called Moses Nzimande and we were three altogether, and he told us there was someone whose brother was Derulem Maponya who was being looked for at De Wet in connection with the murder of a policeman, a certain Warrant Officer Tswale.  Hence they were looking for Japie Maponya in order to question him about his brother, Derulem Maponya, who was a member of the ANC.  He then said to us that we should go and abduct him and he also gave us a photograph of him and a vehicle as well.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2552"><a name="pos2552"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> We abducted him in a cream Jetta, myself, Moses Mzimande and Johannes Mbele and we went to Krugersdorp.  When we got to the building society where Japie was working we parked the vehicle on a road in the direction of Pretoria and got out and we were also told what time he left work and it was - we left Vlakplaas after lunch and we were told that he travels by public transport.  When we got out of the car Mbelo was standing near the vehicle, if I remember correctly.  Moses went towards the post office because there were two roads he could take.  He could either pass the police station or he could pass where we were parked and I stood near the vehicle as well.  When he came out we went ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2553"><a name="pos2553"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> How did you recognise Mr Maponya?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2554"><a name="pos2554"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> As I had said, Sir, we had a photo of him.  The first time I saw him he was inside and I was outside near where he worked.  I was standing outside where he worked.  When he came out he went in the direction of the post office and I followed him because I could see him and Nzimande turned around and spoke to him because he had been told which one it was.  While he was talking to him I arrived and I was interrupted by talking - I interrupted them by talking to Japie.  He looked at me, I had a pocketbook inside which I had put my police appointment certificate and I showed it to him saying to him I was a policeman investigating fraud against him.  He was surprised and I asked him to accompany us to the vehicle and to the police station.  He did not refuse, came back and we got</p>

<p class="line" id="line2557"><a name="pos2557"></a>into the car and he got into the back seat of the vehicle.  I cannot remember correctly, but I think Mbele was driving.  He knew where Krugersdorp Police Station was but he saw us driving in the direction of Pretoria and he wanted to know why were weren't going to the police station.  I told him to shut up and took out a firearm and made him to lie flat in the car, on the floor of the car, and that is when we took him to Vlakplaas. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2558"><a name="pos2558"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Was he interrogated at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2559"><a name="pos2559"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> When we got to Vlakplaas we met Mr De Kock who was there and other whites.  They questioned him intensively about his brother and he continuously denied his whereabouts. De Kock was angry and was shouting and assaulting him until he said to us he is not telling the truth, hit him.  We assaulted him, all of us, myself, Johannes Mbelo, Moses Nzimande and other whites, whose names I cannot remember, who were also present there.  They also assaulted him.  At some stage he spoke about his relatives saying that some of his relatives lived at a certain place and at that stage De Kock said that I should start writing down what he was saying.  He was speaking Afrikaans.  When he was being assaulted he was speaking in Setswana and between Mbelo and myself one of us had to interpret what he was saying.  I started interpreting and I was told to stop and start recording what was being said.  De Kock said I must stop interpreting and start writing down and Mbelo started interpreting.  At that stage he was being assaulted by De Kock and the other whites.  While I was writing there came a time where De Kock wanted a canister of teargas.  I think he went to fetch it from the back of his car and he brought it and he said that we should tie Japie Maponya</p>

<p class="line" id="line2562"><a name="pos2562"></a>round his eyes and we blindfolded him, myself and Johannes Mbelo.  I cannot remember too well if we tied his hands as well.  There was a kombi similar to these that sell ice-cream which we called the A-team, because it didn't have any windows, which was also there.  Mbelo was told to fetch it when we got there.  He was instructed by  De Kock.  We then put him into this kombi and he took his canister of teargas and sprayed it on  his nose and closed his nose and he remained inside coughing in the kombi.  I cannot say how long that went on for, but it was quite a while.  After a while he opened up the kombi and let him out, dragging him out and  threw him on the ground.  He was not talking at that stage while he was lying on the ground.  There came a time where he asked me whether this person would be able to - Major De Kock asked me if this person would be able to recognise me at a future stage and I said yes, and he told me do not worry my China he won't see you again.  He said that in Afrikaans.  And then he said to us we should go, myself and Moses Nzimande and Johannes Mbelo, he said we should go and I then went with him and we left him there with those whites and Japie.  After a while I heard from Willem Nortje that Japie was killed by De Kock and company in Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2563"><a name="pos2563"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> You were not present when Mr Maponya was killed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2571"><a name="pos2571"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I even said at the Eugene de Kock trial that the evidence which I gave was because De Kock promised me that he would assist me in the case with which I was charged if I should - if I lied about him it was because I was angry about everything he had done to me because he had not fulfilled his promises to me and that was where I lied about him having killed Japie because I knew that he would never have survived, because of the way he said to me I would never see him again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2572"><a name="pos2572"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> When you say that you lied about him having killed Japie, do you refer to the fact that you gave evidence that he killed him in your presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2573"><a name="pos2573"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I gave false evidence saying that I was present when he killed him and that was not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2574"><a name="pos2574"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And where you refer to the fact that De Kock did not fulfil his promise and did not help you with the charge against you you refer to the case for which you are now in prison.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2576"><a name="pos2576"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Why did De Kock ask you whether Maponya would recognise you again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2577"><a name="pos2577"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I explained to De Kock that when we met Japie I showed him my appointment certificate and I was not sure whether he had read my name or not and he had also seen me face to face.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2624"><a name="pos2624"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Could they have been six, seven?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2627"><a name="pos2627"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Mbelo and myself and Moses participated when he was there, because the people that started assaulting him were the whites.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2628"><a name="pos2628"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> So in other words he was first assaulted by the whites and thereafter he was assaulted by yourself and Mbelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2629"><a name="pos2629"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes, and then he was assaulted by the whites again.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2637"><a name="pos2637"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> He was lying there.  When we left him his face was still covered and he was lying on the floor there after having been teargassed.  We left him lying there and his face was bloodied and all messed up.</p>

The copy Mr Mpshe has is a copy that was unsigned and faxed to him on a Monday night before the applicant could be consulted and before he could sign his application and during the consultation where I was not present apparently this was added and those must be the copies that you have as Committee members.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2659"><a name="pos2659"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Am I correct the to state to you that the only reason for assaulting Japie Maponya and subsequently him getting killed by Eugene de Kock was to conceal your identity, that is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2660"><a name="pos2660"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Isn't the evidence quite clear, Mr Mpshe, that he was assaulted to get information from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2661"><a name="pos2661"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2662"><a name="pos2662"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Not to conceal anybody's identity.  He was killed.  But the question you put was that he was assaulted and killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2663"><a name="pos2663"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I stand corrected.  He was assaulted to obtain information and he was later killed to conceal your identity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2664"><a name="pos2664"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I also understand it as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2665"><a name="pos2665"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> This killing had nothing to do whatsoever with any political objective.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2666"><a name="pos2666"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I have a bit of difficulty in answering that question because the person that sent me, Eugene de Kock, knew what the political motive was.  I was merely following instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2667"><a name="pos2667"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yes, that may be so but I am reading from your application, what you have submitted to the Committee, that paragraph (d).</p>
<p class="line" id="line2668"><a name="pos2668"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I submit that this line of questioning will not take the matter further and that it is the same as the questioning yesterday of applicant Dirk Coetzee about the Lindley shooting and the diamond dealer.  It is a question of legal argument, whether concealing and hiding the identity of Vlakplaas and the members of the</p>

<p class="line" id="line2672"><a name="pos2672"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> That may be so, but what concerns me though, and I was about to point that out to you, is whether you should not reconsider the amendment that you introduced this morning.  You deleted "murder" and I don't know whether you shouldn't reconsider that, possibly to add "abduction and murder" because the paragraph (d) that Mr Mpshe is dealing with I think he is wanting to show eventually that when he abducted this person he foresaw the possibility that he was going to be killed eventually.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2673"><a name="pos2673"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, I actually made a note of it for re-examination after the questions by the Chairman to make an application to amend again and bring back the murder or accessory to murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2674"><a name="pos2674"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2675"><a name="pos2675"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, can I proceed with my line of questioning based on the objection by my learned.  A ruling has not been made on that.  But I was going to respond to what he has said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2676"><a name="pos2676"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You  want to know whether the killing was in any way related to a political objective.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2677"><a name="pos2677"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That is so, and then objection was raised by Mr Marais.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2678"><a name="pos2678"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Yes, you may put that question to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2679"><a name="pos2679"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Earlier on you stated in response to one of my questions that you were doing what you were told by your superiors.  That may well be so, but I am referring to what you have submitted to the Committee under paragraph (d) which I will read for completeness sake.  You state</p>

<p class="line" id="line2683"><a name="pos2683"></a>It is not a question of having been told to do that.  You submitted this to us.  That is why I want a response from you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2684"><a name="pos2684"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> What I wrote there is - I still think was the way in which things were done.  That is the way things were done politically as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2685"><a name="pos2685"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Wouldn't it be fairer to read paragraph (e) with paragraph (d) Mr Mpshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2686"><a name="pos2686"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I have seen paragraph (e).  The last question closes my questions.  No further questions.</p>

We must forgive them now. But they</p>

After that we came back the same day.  In the afternoon we looked for Japie at his girlfriend's place but he had not yet arrived.  That is when I started searching for him.

Mr Mpshe, his desire for his family to be told where the remains of Japie could be might be something that might be referred to the R&amp;R Committee or the investigators, if it is at all possible to find out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2788"><a name="pos2788"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, I have indicated this to him and to the briefer this morning.

<p class="line" id="line2793"><a name="pos2793"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2794"><a name="pos2794"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> During your trial you denied any involvement in this murder and your presence at the scene of the murder totally.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2796"><a name="pos2796"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Why did you deny it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2797"><a name="pos2797"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> After the case I went to tell Captain Eugene de Kock at the time, my commander, and he said that if you should be arrested you should deny everything with regards to this matter.  I will assist you and I will speak to my superiors about this matter as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2798"><a name="pos2798"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Nevertheless you were convicted of this murder and sentenced to death, is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2802"><a name="pos2802"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Then on the 19th October 1989, the evening before you were due to be executed, you made a statement regarding your involvement in the activities that you are now seeking amnesty for, correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2804"><a name="pos2804"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> In this statement you also denied your involvement in the murder of Lourens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2805"><a name="pos2805"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2806"><a name="pos2806"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Subsequent to that you gave evidence at the Harms Commission where you admitted that you stabbed Mr Lourens several times and that he died because of that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2808"><a name="pos2808"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Can you explain to the Committee now how this killing occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2809"><a name="pos2809"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> It was on 11 September.  I remember it was during the day, I cannot remember what time it was, I was with Johnny Mohani, who came to me and told me where - I knew where Lourens and them stayed - but he said to me that Lourens and them have money, lots and lots of money in their house which we can go and steal.  So I did not have money at the time and I had a large family to take care of at home and the money which I obtained by going out to work in places like Durban and Rustenberg was money which I used to claim for travelling at Vlakplaas, and when De Kock came he said that I should not be sent out any more, that I should remain at Vlakplaas and I found that by staying at Vlakplaas I did not receive this extra money any more, and I had somewhat adjusted my budget to accommodate that and I had just bought a house and furniture and my car was at the garage and I had a lot of expenses and I found that what</p>
<p class="line" id="line2810"><a name="pos2810"></a>22.1 - 1B	Johnny/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2811"><a name="pos2811"></a>MR MARAIS	226	A NOFOMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line2812"><a name="pos2812"></a>Johnny Mohani was saying to me about this money that we were going to go and steal there seemed like a good idea and I agreed because of my financial problems.  When we got to Mr Lourens's house we found him there and when he appeared he said to me, what are you kaffirs doing on my farm?  And he was carrying a firearm and there was no chance for me to run away.  That annoyed me, the fact that he called me a kaffir, especially when I thought of the way which I worked at Vlakplaas because quite often I worked for whites who were oppressing blacks and today here a white man is calling me a kaffir.  This term that I absolutely resented.  I was angry and he grabbed me and we wrestled for the firearm he had.  I had a knife and  firearm in my possession.  While we were wrestling I took out the knife and I stabbed him with it.  He fell with the firearm.  From there onwards I found that Johnny had already gone inside and I called him, not knowing what he had found inside the house.  I lit a candle which I had found and put it under the curtain to set the curtain alight so that whoever arrived there would think that the house had burnt down to eliminate any traces of even Johnny's fingerprints if police were to arrive.  We did not proceed to do what we had set out to do because of what then happened between Mr Lourens and myself. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2813"><a name="pos2813"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Would you say that in your training at Vlakplaas and the work you did in the Security Police influenced you in the way you reacted when he spoke to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2814"><a name="pos2814"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> As I said, Sir, the way in which I worked at Vlakplaas, I saw that the battle which we were fighting against the ANC was the side which I was on was that I was fighting black people, assisting white people to fight black people and what annoyed me was that he should have called me</p>

<p class="line" id="line2817"><a name="pos2817"></a>a kaffir and that was one of the reasons why I stabbed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2818"><a name="pos2818"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What were the other reasons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2819"><a name="pos2819"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> The other reason was that while we were wrestling with this firearm there was a possibility that he would have shot me with it and I realised that if I could stab him it is possible that he could drop the firearm and when he dropped the firearm - by the time he dropped the firearm I had already stabbed him several times and I saw when he fell that he had already died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2820"><a name="pos2820"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Would you say that through your training and work at Vlakplaas you became accustomed to violence and killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2821"><a name="pos2821"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> I would start by saying that before I even got to Vlakplaas I was never involved in any violent activities and I have never been to gaol.  All this violence is what I had learnt at Vlakplaas.  When I got there I did not know anything about such violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2822"><a name="pos2822"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> When you went to the farm of Lourens, was it ever your intention to kill somebody or to steal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2823"><a name="pos2823"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> As I had said, the intention was to go and steal, we were not going there to kill anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2824"><a name="pos2824"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You had a knife and a gun with you, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2825"><a name="pos2825"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Sir, those were weapons which I carried with me at all times, that stayed with me at all times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2826"><a name="pos2826"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> No further questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2827"><a name="pos2827"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MARAIS</p>

<p class="line" id="line2830"><a name="pos2830"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, may I ask for a short adjournment. There is a document I would like to peruse first before I</p>

<p class="line" id="line2832"><a name="pos2832"></a>MR MPSHE	228	A NOFOMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line2833"><a name="pos2833"></a>put questions to the applicant. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2834"><a name="pos2834"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> To your knowledge it was fairly common for white people to call black people kaffirs during those times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2835"><a name="pos2835"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2836"><a name="pos2836"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> So this was not the first time that you heard a white man call a black man a kaffir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2837"><a name="pos2837"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2838"><a name="pos2838"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And this was not the first time that you were called a kaffir by a white man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2839"><a name="pos2839"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> It was the first time a white man had called me a kaffir to my face.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2840"><a name="pos2840"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> ... to be deeply insulting to black people, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2841"><a name="pos2841"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2842"><a name="pos2842"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And as far as I know, black people never accepted to be called a kaffir at any stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2843"><a name="pos2843"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2844"><a name="pos2844"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Nofomela, on page 27 of your application you state that you committed the murder because you were motivated and caused by the political indoctrination that you had received as a Security Policeman.  What was this indoctrination that you are referring to in your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2845"><a name="pos2845"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOFOMELA:</span> In the sense that when someone did not agree with you it meant that that person, according to the indoctrination, was that that person could be dangerous to you and that you should regard that person as your enemy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2846"><a name="pos2846"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> What in fact motivated you to kill this person?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2855"><a name="pos2855"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did not expect to find him there so I did not anticipate any reaction, we expected to find the place empty.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2857"><a name="pos2857"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Because we were going there to steal and we would not have gone there with the intention of stealing knowing that there are people there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2858"><a name="pos2858"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET-MARAIS::</span> Mr Chairman the evidence of this witness was not that it was in the evening and also from the record it appears that it was in the afternoon around 4 o'clock.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2862"><a name="pos2862"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Because of the way Johnny Mohani told me he knew that they used to go away during the day and he knew that they were not supposed to be there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2863"><a name="pos2863"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> They used to go away during the day, what sort of farm was this?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2873"><a name="pos2873"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2874"><a name="pos2874"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> When you say the training and work that you did as at the Security Branch was aimed at fighting the enemies of the State, you in fact are referring to people who were hostile to the Government you were serving?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2875"><a name="pos2875"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2876"><a name="pos2876"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> In fact Mr Lourens represented the society which belonged to the NP-led Government, he was a member of that society, he was protected.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2878"><a name="pos2878"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> He therefore was not a political threat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2879"><a name="pos2879"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No except that what he said to me annoyed me by calling me a "kaffir", apart from that, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2880"><a name="pos2880"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> During your stay at Vlakplaas had you ever heard white security policemen referring to the black targets as "kaffirs"?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2885"><a name="pos2885"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was a common word which I had heard quite often, specifically being used at Vlakplaas being used amongst the whites talking to each other but it had never been used, directed at me it was the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2886"><a name="pos2886"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> You had heard this word being used by the white security officers at Vlakplaas, so it wasn't much of a shock for you to hear another white person referring to you as a "kaffir"?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2889"><a name="pos2889"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I said that I never heard them use the word, I heard other people use the word and it was used, and I knew that black people did not like the word as much as I didn't want it either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2890"><a name="pos2890"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> ...at Vlakplaas when you say you heard other people use the word, you are not referring to white officers at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2891"><a name="pos2891"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No Ma'am.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2893"><a name="pos2893"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was probably a mistake, I did not hear whites at Vlakplaas using it, I heard whites generally using it towards blacks, referring to blacks quite often.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2895"><a name="pos2895"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I have often seen white people in arguments or fighting with blacks calling them "kaffirs".</p>
<p class="line" id="line2896"><a name="pos2896"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> ...as you've made reference to additional remuneration you received when you were working in places like Durban and you said that you had to get hooked into the suggestion to rob Lourens when the suggestion was made to you by Johnny Mohani.   What were you referring to, I probably did not understand your evidence properly, did you actually get rewards... (discussion aside between members)...thank you I now understand I've just been corrected.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2905"><a name="pos2905"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> They were as such, being elderly people an easy target for you to rob?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2906"><a name="pos2906"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes to go and steal their money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2907"><a name="pos2907"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> When you planned this robbery what did you anticipate, would they resist if they were there and what would you do if they resisted your attempt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2908"><a name="pos2908"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I was not expecting a confrontation and we were not going there to go and rob them, we were going to steal their money because we were not expecting to find them there we were going to go there and steal their money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2909"><a name="pos2909"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Wasn't he sitting on a chair in front of the house when you approached the house?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2914"><a name="pos2914"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> We came from behind the house, we could not see what was in front of the house and when we got to the front of the house we saw him sitting there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2915"><a name="pos2915"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> ...before approaching the house tried to spy and see whether somebody was there?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2923"><a name="pos2923"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No I did not know about the workers because the house in front of their house was occupied by black people and I did not know who they worked for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2924"><a name="pos2924"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> How did Mohani receive a wound on his hand, how was he wounded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2925"><a name="pos2925"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He says the way in which I was stabbing this Mr Lourens he tried to assist in rescuing(?), he says he was stopping me and I struck him in the process although I couldn't remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2926"><a name="pos2926"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Mr Nofomela did the fact that you have previously on many occasions heard the word "kaffir" being used at Vlakplaas made you think the word is less offensive?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2941"><a name="pos2941"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Where was the money supposed to be kept Mr Nofomela?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2942"><a name="pos2942"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Inside the house sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2943"><a name="pos2943"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Just lying around, this lots of money they just left it lying around did they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2944"><a name="pos2944"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The person that knew was the one that accompanied me, Johnny Mohani, he knew where the money was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2945"><a name="pos2945"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Did you ask him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2946"><a name="pos2946"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I asked him and he said he knew where it was that we should go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2947"><a name="pos2947"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Was it kept in a safe or something that had to be opened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2948"><a name="pos2948"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He did not say it was in a safe he said it was in a bag.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2949"><a name="pos2949"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Left their farm, two old men went away leaving their farm, leaving lots of money lying in a bag, is that what you would have us believe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2950"><a name="pos2950"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Sir I believed that it was there the way in which it was explained to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2951"><a name="pos2951"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> And you came around from the back of the house and you saw this old man sitting in his chair, why didn't you turn and run or walk away?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2954"><a name="pos2954"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> We were already in the front of the house by this stage, by the time we got to the front of the house he had seen us and he had already got up and was coming towards us with his gun and that is why I stood until he came to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2955"><a name="pos2955"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> He came towards you with a gun you say now, threatening you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2956"><a name="pos2956"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes he was carrying it in his hand and he had just said "hey kaffirs what are you doing on my farm?", there was no chance for me to run away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2957"><a name="pos2957"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> So you...him and stabbed him to death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2958"><a name="pos2958"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He came to me and grabbed me and that is where I grabbed his hand that had the firearm and we wrestled and I stabbed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2959"><a name="pos2959"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> ...that he was an old man, how many times did you stab him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2960"><a name="pos2960"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I cannot remember whether it was more than three times, maybe four times or five times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2961"><a name="pos2961"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> How were you arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2962"><a name="pos2962"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Johnny Mohani was first arrested and then they looked for me and I surrendered myself to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2963"><a name="pos2963"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Was Johnny a member of the police as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2964"><a name="pos2964"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No sir he was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2965"><a name="pos2965"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Mr Nofomela after your arrest you consulted Mr De Kock who was your commander who advised you that he would assist you in trying to take you out of the quagmire in which you found yourself in.   Did he explain to you how he was going to assist you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2966"><a name="pos2966"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He said he was going to speak to his superiors so that I could get out of the trouble I was in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2967"><a name="pos2967"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Did you in fact believe that he was capable of doing that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2970"><a name="pos2970"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2971"><a name="pos2971"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> That is why you persisted with the lie you gave, even during your trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2972"><a name="pos2972"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes Ma'am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2973"><a name="pos2973"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> In your application you state that the reason why you stabbed Mr Lourens was because you lost control after he called you a "kaffir"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2974"><a name="pos2974"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes that is one of the causes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2975"><a name="pos2975"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> ...him pointing you with a gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2976"><a name="pos2976"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2977"><a name="pos2977"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> So which came first, did he point at you with a gun and then call you a "kaffir" or he called you a "kaffir" and advanced towards you with a gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2978"><a name="pos2978"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He came to me having already called me a "kaffir" by the time he came to me I was angry already.    Secondly it was so that I could get the firearm from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2979"><a name="pos2979"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> After stabbing him did you take his firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2980"><a name="pos2980"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I left it lying on the ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2981"><a name="pos2981"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> As I understand it, you attempted to burn the house down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2982"><a name="pos2982"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2985"><a name="pos2985"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> I'm a little confused now, you've told us that while you were struggling with Mr Lourens your companion tried to stop you and he got stabbed on the hand?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2987"><a name="pos2987"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Was he involved in the struggle while you were struggling with Mr Lourens when he approached you</p>

<p class="line" id="line2991"><a name="pos2991"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes he was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2992"><a name="pos2992"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> I understood earlier in your evidence you said he went on into the house and you tried to burn the house down to get rid of his fingerprints in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2993"><a name="pos2993"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Sir this took place in a very short space of time, stabbing him, by the time he fell I looked around for Johnny Mohani and I found, I didn't find him next to me and I found him inside the house because this incident took place in front of the house.   I called him and saw that he was already inside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2994"><a name="pos2994"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> He was involved in the struggle, got stabbed, and then just left you struggling with Mr Lourens and went into the house.   Is that to get the money you'd come to steal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2995"><a name="pos2995"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes I assume so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2996"><a name="pos2996"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> As far as he was concerned you were taking care of Mr Lourens and he'd get the money, is that the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2997"><a name="pos2997"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I would say that was probably his intention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2998"><a name="pos2998"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> He knew you were stabbing Mr Lourens at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2999"><a name="pos2999"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I would say so sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3000"><a name="pos3000"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET-MARAIS::</span> Mr Chairman I have no re-examination but before this witness stands down I want to place certain matters on record with regard to the drafting of his affidavit, since there has appeared contradictions between the evidence of this witness and the contents of his affidavit and it could be necessary for him to confirm certain of the matters that I place on record inasfar as they fall within his knowledge.

<p class="line" id="line3002"><a name="pos3002"></a>MR DE WET-MARAIS	239	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line3003"><a name="pos3003"></a>1996, my instructing attorney Mr Knight has endeavoured to get instructions and funding for this matter through the police where Nofomela was employed at that stage.   He could not do so and when the dates were set for the hearings in Durban of this Committee, he still had not obtained instructions to instruct counsel.   After the dates were received, I went to the Legal Aid Board with Mr Jansen to convince them that Mr Nofomela is entitled to legal aid and that we should carry on with drafting the affidavit.  Until today we have not received formal notification from the Legal Aid Board with regard to this application.   Our attorney was also in contact with Mr Mpshe's office during that time and submitted affidavits for Mr Coetzee and Mr Tshikalanga.   Mr Mpshe's office urgently wanted an affidavit from Mr Nofomela and I and Mr Jansen drafted this affidavit on a Sunday afternoon from my consultation notes with Mr Nofomela from seven years ago, during the Harms Commission and from the affidavits of Mr Coetzee and Mr Tshikalanga.   The next day, the Monday, I went to prison to consult with Mr Nofomela in order to get him to sign the affidavit and to correct whatever needed to be corrected.  When I arrived at the prison I was informed that, which was quite surprising for a prisoner serving a life sentence, that a computer said that he was "temporarily out".   Apparently he was at the De Kock trial where the judge in the trial summoned all witnesses to attend the sentencing of De Kock and we could not consult and we could not change anything in the affidavit at that stage.   That night we faxed an unsigned copy of the affidavit to Mr Mpshe's office since they insisted that they needed it urgently in order to try and get the witnesses and victims together for the</p>

<p class="line" id="line3005"><a name="pos3005"></a>MR DE WET-MARAIS	240	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line3006"><a name="pos3006"></a>hearing which was due to start the next Tuesday in Durban.  I was not available the rest of that week and Mr Jansen on the Wednesday assisted us and went to prison and got the affidavit signed after Mr Nofomela browsed through it and corrected the one glaring mistake where he at the Harms Commission gave the false evidence with regard to De Kock shooting Mponja in his presence.    We arrived in Durban for the hearing which, as you will know, the Committee wanted to start with as soon as possible since there was a criminal trial set down in the matter of Mr Mkenge's murder for 2 December.   We consulted on the Mkenge matter that morning before the hearing started in Durban and that is how the evidence was led there.   After the hearings in Durban you will also remember that I withdrew then since we still had no instructions from the Legal Aid Board and it was not sure what our situation was.   Mr Nofomela was also not happy with the way things went in Durban since we could not have proper preparation and proper consultation due to the time pressures at that stage.   I was only re-instructed last week Wednesday to continue with the matter.   During the December recess or just before the recess there was an application in the Supreme Court in Pretoria brought by Generals in the Defence Force to get a court order that the State Departments where they were employed during the times they committed the acts for which they now seek amnesty, that they should be ordered to pay for their amnesty applications and this has still not been sorted out.   However, we consulted last Thursday and Friday on the five matters that we prepared for Monday's hearing and those were, according to Mr Mpshe's instructions, that we could decide which matters we wanted to call first.   None of</p>

<p class="line" id="line3009"><a name="pos3009"></a>those matters included any of the matters that the applicant confirmed in his evidence yesterday.   Yesterday we did not expect to do the confirmations before all the evidence on all the incidents had been finalised and therefore when we were asked by Mr Mpshe whether we would do the confirmations yesterday after lunch, we did not consult on those incidents, it would have necessitated a further adjournment in order to do that and the applicant has rectified the shortcomings in his affidavit during his evidence.   His evidence before this Committee should therefore be regarded as his evidence on these matters, correcting the shortcomings in his affidavits.   None of this was due to any negligence or lack of interest on the part of the applicant and it is my submission that he should not be in any way blamed for it.   Thank you.</p>

My learned friend states that I indicated to the - which is correct- that we do the confirmation after lunch and that is very correct, but it would seem unless if I did not understand him well, it would seem the fact that there were mistakes and certain things from the applicant when giving evidence on these confirmatories, it would seem this fact has been alluded to my having said that this be done after lunch, if I interpret him correctly.   If my interpretation is correct then I would say that really to me does not hold water at all</p>

<p class="line" id="line3017"><a name="pos3017"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Be that as it may, Mr Marais and Mr Jansen when we resume after the short adjournment I would like you to consider whether it is possible for you to draw our attention to the relevant pages and passages in the document which has been compiled by Mr De Kock, concerning those items which we merely confirmed, in which evidence was not directly led.   There were several items on which we had agreed, because of the modus operandi being the same in all those matters, so if you could refer us in respect of those matters to the relevant pages in the manuscript which has been prepared, we would be pleased, in respect of all these matters on which we agreed yesterday.   If there is any amendment that you would like to make in that regard in respect of those matters which we confirmed yesterday, Mr Marais, you would be at liberty to do so.   If it is convenient we should do that shortly after the adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3018"><a name="pos3018"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET-MARAIS::</span> Yes thank you Mr Chairman we shall do so.   Yes Mr Chairman we are in possession of his evidence before the Harms Commission, I will discuss it with my instructing attorney to determine in which way it can be made available to the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3019"><a name="pos3019"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Even if we can be referred to the correct pages and so on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3020"><a name="pos3020"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET-MARAIS::</span> Yes Mr Chairman I will not be able to do that after the adjournment it will take some time to link all the matters that amnesty is sought for...(end of 2a)...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3021"><a name="pos3021"></a>yes no then it will be possible to do that if the evidence</p>

<p class="line" id="line3026"><a name="pos3026"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET-MARAIS::</span> Mr Chairman the references in the Harms Commission to the Lourens case, paragraph 16 in the amnesty application, you will find on page 200, lines 17-19 and on page 655 from line 8-28 and on page 656 from line 13 through page 657 to line 2.   There may be further references that I couldn't find now, I don't have my notes of the Harms Commission, if I find that I will include it in the submissions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3027"><a name="pos3027"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> These are the references from the Harms Commission report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3028"><a name="pos3028"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET-MARAIS::</span> From the evidence, the evidence by this applicant before the Harms Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3029"><a name="pos3029"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> From the evidence before the Harms Commission.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3031"><a name="pos3031"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3032"><a name="pos3032"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Chairman we are now in the hands of Advocate Jansen on matter No 2 in the Dirk Coetzee and Tshikalanga applications, paginated page 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3033"><a name="pos3033"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Before you commence it has come to our attention that there have been reports in the press that Eugene De Kock has been subpoenaed to appear before this Committee to give evidence.   This was on the radio yesterday and again some reference was made to it this morning.   My enquiries have revealed that there is no such thing, no subpoena has been issued by this Committee to Eugene De Kock to appear before us.   What has happened, I am given to understand, is that Mr Mpshe has drawn the attention of Mr Eugene De Kock that he has been implicated in the evidence that has been given before us and that because he is implicated, his</p>
<p class="line" id="line3034"><a name="pos3034"></a>2b	attention /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3035"><a name="pos3035"></a>CHAIRMAN	244</p>
<p class="line" id="line3036"><a name="pos3036"></a>attention is drawn to it and he is afforded an opportunity to react to it in whichever way he may consider appropriate.  I think that there has been a misrepresentation in the media that there was in fact a subpoena issued to De Kock.   I am hoping that this kind of mis-reporting does not occur again, a little bit of care on the part of the media will eliminate this kind of difficulty because it leads to other problems and telephone calls are being directed to members of the Committee from all sorts of people and at all times of the day and one wants to try and avoid that.   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3037"><a name="pos3037"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, before I proceed I have drafted a short list of the incidents that we have dealt with by way of confirmations, which was done yesterday, as well as the two matters which we intend to deal by way of confirmation now.   Mr Chairman I have an original handwritten one and four copies for the members.   There are two columns, the first column refers to the application number as you would note, the application Annexure deals with the different incidents by number.   That number is followed by the paginated number of the application, I've derived that merely by adding four page numbers to the typed page number and then the second column are references to the manuscript, firstly the paragraph of the manuscript and its page.   As it pleases you Mr Chairman I then wish to call Mr Coetzee again to testify.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3040"><a name="pos3040"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Coetzee you have your application which has been submitted to this Committee as well as your manuscript which is evidence book No 1 before the Committee, before you is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3041"><a name="pos3041"></a>2b	ANSWER: /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3042"><a name="pos3042"></a>MR JANSEN	245	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3043"><a name="pos3043"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3044"><a name="pos3044"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> If I could refer you to matter No 2 of your application, the murders of Peter Nglamini and Selbe Mavuso, which is found on page 108 of your manuscript.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3045"><a name="pos3045"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I've got the manuscript Mr Chairman and I've got it on the application too, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3046"><a name="pos3046"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You have been afforded the opportunity to go through these two documents again before testifying now, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3047"><a name="pos3047"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3048"><a name="pos3048"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Will you confirm the content of these two documents, subject to your evidence yesterday concerning the history of the manuscript?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3049"><a name="pos3049"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I so do confirm it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3050"><a name="pos3050"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Shortly, Peter Nglamini and Selbe Mavuso fall in two different categories.   Peter Nglamini was a person working for Vlakplaas at the time he was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3051"><a name="pos3051"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3052"><a name="pos3052"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What was the basic motive behind killing him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3053"><a name="pos3053"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Posing a threat, I don't think he was completely -with all respect - all there as far as mental capabilities were concerned, and secondly he wrote a letter to the Commissioner complaining about the things going on a Vlakplaas.   I was then instructed by Brigadier Schoon to deal with him at the same time as when I dealt with Vusi, Selbe Mavuso who then at the time was detained at Brits Prison after being abducted from Mozambique on the Mtola raid in February 1990 by the army, in conjunction with some of the Vlakplaas askaris.   Peter Nglamini, an ANC member who studied in Bulgaria if I have it right and then went to the South African authorities when he became disillusioned</p>
<p class="line" id="line3054"><a name="pos3054"></a>2b	with /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3055"><a name="pos3055"></a>MR JANSEN	246	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3056"><a name="pos3056"></a>with the ANC and was then brought back to South Africa by the South African Security Police.   After debriefing by the debriefing team which was usually Col Jack Buchner, the later Commissioner of the KwaZulu police and Col (indistinct) Baker, retired as a Brigadier, they were the two people who were usually debriefing the ANC cadres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3057"><a name="pos3057"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Then treated as an askari?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3058"><a name="pos3058"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3059"><a name="pos3059"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Or did he join the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3060"><a name="pos3060"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's right Mr Chairman.   I don't think he was a fully-fledged member yet of the police but he was on Vlakplaas as an askari.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3061"><a name="pos3061"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Was it Peter Nglameni whom you said seemed to be mentally disturbed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3062"><a name="pos3062"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> As I say, not completely mentally disturbed but, I don't know how to put it, but not all there, you could see some times he was acting peculiar, in a peculiar way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3063"><a name="pos3063"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> So the instructions to you to attend to this matter was given by who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3064"><a name="pos3064"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Brigadier Schoon at the same time as I got the instruction to get rid of Selbe Mavuso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3065"><a name="pos3065"></a>MR JANSEN (contd)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3066"><a name="pos3066"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Selbe Mavuso was a political detainee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3067"><a name="pos3067"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct, he was held under the Security Act, I can't remember exactly what Act it was, at Brits police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3068"><a name="pos3068"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you regard the actions in respect of Mr Mavuso comparable to those in relation to Mr Sizwe Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3069"><a name="pos3069"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3070"><a name="pos3070"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Chairman just to remind you that was matter No 3 which was one of the matters that was dealt with in</p>
<p class="line" id="line3071"><a name="pos3071"></a>2b	Durban /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3072"><a name="pos3072"></a>MR JANSEN	247	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3073"><a name="pos3073"></a>Durban.   It is matter No 3 on paginated page 10.   If I could then refer you to the next incident, the incident of the attempted kidnapping of General, it is matter No 11, typed page 21 of the application and page 103 of the manuscript, paginated 25.   103, paragraph 5.4.14.4.   Again you have had the opportunity to read the content of both documents as it relates to the person called General, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3074"><a name="pos3074"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3075"><a name="pos3075"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Do you confirm under oath what is contained in these documents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3076"><a name="pos3076"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I do so confirm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3077"><a name="pos3077"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Just to clear up again, it is said that the intention was to kidnap him and to eliminate him afterwards.  Was there a firm decision taken at that stage that he would be eliminated or was it merely a question of assuming that that would be a high probability of what would happen to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3078"><a name="pos3078"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Assuming it as a 100% possibility because that was how people were dealt with in the usual way, that used to be kidnapped and refused to co-operate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3079"><a name="pos3079"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR JANSEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3080"><a name="pos3080"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> Sorry Mr Chairman I am just reminded that there are a set of documents which come from the Harms Commission and the Neethling trial relating to Mr Selbe Mavuso, if I could just HAND THOSE DOCUMENTS up.   In essence Mr Chairman these documents contain the release, the so-called release orders of Mr Mavuso as well as correspondence of his attorney, Ms Priscilla Jana, which shows that he was released I think it was 11 October 1981 and that he has never since been seen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3081"><a name="pos3081"></a>2b	CHAIRMAN: /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3082"><a name="pos3082"></a>248	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3083"><a name="pos3083"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> This will be EXHIBIT 8.   I am tempted to congratulate you for having failed in abducting this man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3084"><a name="pos3084"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes things went horribly wrong, who is this, the General?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3085"><a name="pos3085"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> This is the General.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3086"><a name="pos3086"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Ja the drops that were apparently put into his liquor he ditched on the sly and we thought it would just be a question of going in with Lt Koos Van der Lit(?) who was (indistinct), picking up this paralytic man, putting him in the boot of the car and bring him back.   We weren't armed at all, not prepared at all for what we bumped into and I might just explain that Mr Lockwood the source that would have, that was trying to get him drunk and the drops into his drinks, when he came out and told me the drops are not working, I asked him to open his bedroom window so that we can help have a, we can listen for ourselves to the speech of this guy whether he's drunk or not.   He was completely sober and the next moment he just stood up and said I'm going to leave and on his way to the toilet, he had to pass through the room where we were standing in, and just bumped into us and we had to prevent him from switching on that light.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3087"><a name="pos3087"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Is the position that up to now he is still known as General and you don't know him by name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3088"><a name="pos3088"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No, but the ANC has related his name to me he's into business apparently at the stage whilst I was in exile, he left the organisation and did business in North Africa but he was the main money-man in Swaziland supplying money for all the missions of the cadres coming through from Mozambique on their way to South Africa on missions.   But he's well-known and can be traced.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3091"><a name="pos3091"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> With regard to Peter Nglamini which is on page 7 of your application, I want to know what political threat was posed by Peter Nglamini to Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3092"><a name="pos3092"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The threat that he would blow the activities on Vlakplaas as he apparently did in his letter writing to the Commissioner of Police complaining about what's going on on the farm.   I've never seen the letter but I, if I remember correctly it was handed in at the Harms Commission so it was a question of exposing the Vlakplaas, the Security Police activities which eventually resulted in the order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3093"><a name="pos3093"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> To the senior officers within the Security Branch, he could have exposed that only to the senior officers within the Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3094"><a name="pos3094"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I think the letter was addressed to the Commissioner of Police, I speak under correction but as I say it is available I think in the Harms Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3095"><a name="pos3095"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> So in fact you were not fearful of him regarding him having to defect to the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3096"><a name="pos3096"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well I think that would have been a second option if he, of him - and I'm only speculating - if he did not get a satisfactory answer from the Commissioner of Police or Coetzee, that his complaints were just ignored.   That could have been his second option.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3097"><a name="pos3097"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> How do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3098"><a name="pos3098"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Yes, but the decision to eliminate him was done purely because he had written this letter, which might expose Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3099"><a name="pos3099"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3100"><a name="pos3100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> That's all there was to it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3101"><a name="pos3101"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3102"><a name="pos3102"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> He was really an annoyance because he was</p>
<p class="line" id="line3103"><a name="pos3103"></a>2b	timid /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3104"><a name="pos3104"></a>MEMBER OF COMMISSION	250	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3105"><a name="pos3105"></a>timid and frail, isn't it so Mr Coetzee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3106"><a name="pos3106"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No we did in fact use him and he went out with us on missions, he was just always a little bit late and delayed and sort of came into conflict with his fellow askaris, that happened, but the eventual decision by headquarters was as a result of his complaint to the Commissioner of Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3107"><a name="pos3107"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Is there a copy of that letter available?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3108"><a name="pos3108"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I'm sure at the Harms Commission it was handed in, I'm fairly sure of that.   It was mentioned in any case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3109"><a name="pos3109"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> What sort of complaints did he make about Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3110"><a name="pos3110"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I did not know Mr Chairman, I can't remember seeing the letter personally, it was just relayed to me by Brigadier Schoon and I was instructed to make a plan with him at the same time as with, that I dealt with Vusi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3111"><a name="pos3111"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> Mr Chairman if I could add, just to repeat what I stated the other day, the B Series of documents, in other words the evidentiary documents that were presented to the Harms Commission comprises this series of documents referred to as the B Series.   They have only come into our possession I think it was during the course of December and we haven't had a look at all of them but we will attempt tonight again to have a look at this specific document to see if we could find anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3112"><a name="pos3112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3113"><a name="pos3113"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> What I really wanted to know is whether it was a complaint of people behaving improperly at Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3114"><a name="pos3114"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> I have not had sight of the letter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3115"><a name="pos3115"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I also personally haven't, I don't know what the contents of the letter exactly contained, what exactly was</p>
<p class="line" id="line3116"><a name="pos3116"></a>2b	contained /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3117"><a name="pos3117"></a>MEMBER OF COMMISSION	251	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3118"><a name="pos3118"></a>contained in it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3119"><a name="pos3119"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> So it's possible the complaint was nothing about the political aspect but merely about behaviour and corruption that existed at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3120"><a name="pos3120"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It is possible but I'm speculating Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3121"><a name="pos3121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Mr Jansen we will not be concerned with all the documents that go to make up the file of the Harms Commission, but when you go through it and if there is this letter you will draw our attention to it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3122"><a name="pos3122"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN::</span> I will Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3123"><a name="pos3123"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Thank you.   It must seem strange to you that because a letter of complaint is written by one of the people employed at Vlakplaas is regarded as sufficient to want to eliminate him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3124"><a name="pos3124"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chairman in the context of the Security Police set-up and Vlakplaas set-up, no because I mean look at myself when I open my mouth, every attempt possible was made to silence me, while they police did everything to mislead the politicians.   So it is very difficult, as soon as there was some reluctance on the part of some askari that pointed towards a possible revealing of the secrets or exposing the Security Police atrocities at all, a plan was made with him.  He was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3125"><a name="pos3125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Who precisely takes the decision of such magnitude?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3126"><a name="pos3126"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> This specific incident was Brigadier Schoon, in Brigadier Schoon's office in the presence of Captain Vermeulen.   No, no sorry I'm confusing Captain Vermeulen's presence with Mohema, Isaac Ace Mohema which we will still deal with, but by Brigadier Schoon.   Of course Mr Chairman, as a result of the need to know (indistinct) I would not</p>
<p class="line" id="line3127"><a name="pos3127"></a>2b	know /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3128"><a name="pos3128"></a>MEMBER OF COMMISSION	252	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3129"><a name="pos3129"></a>know how high up, but I can have experience in my time link Brigadier Jan Du Preez, the second in charge under General Johan Coetzee to several incidents, as for instance the bounty money or the reward money that they received in the Mnenge case and in other incidents, an officer or two higher.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3130"><a name="pos3130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Who was Brigadier Schoon's immediate superior?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3132"><a name="pos3132"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Did Brigadier Schoon give you instructions on how you had to carry out the elimination of Seve Nglamini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3133"><a name="pos3133"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No he did not say in the exact way, as I previously pointed out at one of the previous cases, there is a way of understanding and talking and when he said make a, Peter, Vusi had the attitude of charge me or shoot me and so shoot him, make a plan with him.   In the same time take Peter with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3134"><a name="pos3134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> That is sufficient specific for those who understand that language?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3136"><a name="pos3136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> For present purposes that was an instruction to eliminate these individuals?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3138"><a name="pos3138"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Did you take the decision to use the knock-out drops?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3139"><a name="pos3139"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Ja it was left over to me.   I did arrange with Brigadier Schoon because General Lothar Neethling I think he said I don't know how many of those drops, it was very few, it costs R40 a drop, it was very expensive.   General Lothar Neethling of the forensic laboratory won't supply me with</p>

<p class="line" id="line3142"><a name="pos3142"></a>any drops except if it is arranged by my superior, which was done explicitly.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3143"><a name="pos3143"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Why was it necessary Mr Coetzee to first poison them when in any case you intended to shoot them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3144"><a name="pos3144"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chairman, one makes provision for any eventuality, I mean as clearly proved in the Botswana raid, power failure, we had no torches with us, rain helped us in getting to the premises but again handicapped us again.   So you never know, I had everything in my boot I made provision for, as I say any eventuality, any possibility, any way of giving these guys these drops, or this poison.   If they could get in this poison and eventually it was a heart attack and we were caught in the act before we could burn that body for instance, and a postmortem was done, it would have proved...(end of 2b)...I was supplied with a very limited one for each operation and at the most when we went to Swaziland for like in the case of abducting General, instead where four to eight drops can knock out from any slender man to any big man very easily, within 20-30 minutes, I was supplied with more than that because I had enough drops to hand to Lockwood and he did four drops - according to what he reported back to me - into General's first drink and his driver, so that was altogether eight drops.   His driver got it in and passed out.   When he saw that nothing happened to General, he apparently doped him a second time and still nothing happened.   So General must have ditched that drink, there's no ways that he could have got those drops in and stood up without falling down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3145"><a name="pos3145"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> With regard to the matter at hand, that's the Peter Nglamini and Selve Mavuso, was it your original intent to kill them by poisoning them?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3147"><a name="pos3147"></a>MEMBER OF COMMISSION	254	D J COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3148"><a name="pos3148"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct Mr Chairman, one of the options that I made provision for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3149"><a name="pos3149"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Don't you make reference in your manuscript that you intended to poison them and later shoot them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3150"><a name="pos3150"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No I think dope them and eventually what happened we gave them knock-out drops because the poison didn't work.  We administered the poison on three occasions apparently after it was doubled and trebled, we went back to, I myself once picked it up from General Lothar Neethling the poison, the poison and knock-out drops.   The poison didn't work.   Koos Vermeulen went back the second day for a double dose and about two weeks later, it was just after the Lindley incident on the Sunday 25 October, Vusi was released on 11 October, the first poison administered on the 11th, the second dose on the 12th and the third one on the 25th the Sunday after, and on the second occasion Koos Vermeulen went back to General Neethling's office and the third one Koos accompanied me on the Sunday morning to his house where we picked him up and went to the forensic laboratory.   He prepared again this poison, mixed it and he drew it up in two of my insulin syringes, 100 unit syringes, and said you must administer it.   He couldn't understand why this poison was not working because he said apparently if you administer it to sheep within minutes the sheep just give one jump and fall down and the result would be a heart attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3151"><a name="pos3151"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Don't you think you were making guinea pigs of the people who were in your care?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3152"><a name="pos3152"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well that was exactly I think what happened because with the drops, knock-out drops that I gave Vusi in that night after we saw that the poison didn't work, I kept for Lothar Neethling's purpose a record of how long it takes</p>

<p class="line" id="line3155"><a name="pos3155"></a>and what is the exact reaction that is evoked from this person after giving him this drop.   How long it takes to knock him over and then what happens thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3156"><a name="pos3156"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> This couldn't have been an experiment, you weren't really using them as guinea pigs, you were really hoping they would become corpses isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3157"><a name="pos3157"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes it is true but I did keep sort of a record for our own purposes for future references because that was the first occasion that knock-out drops were supplied to us and we made use of it.   It was important for us to know if we might go into a neighbouring country and want to abduct someone like General how many drops to administer, what the reaction would be and how long before we could move in and in what way would, what reaction it would evoke from the victim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3158"><a name="pos3158"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE::</span> Were there to your knowledge any actions, disciplinary or otherwise, taken by the superiors in response to the letter that had been written by Nglameni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3159"><a name="pos3159"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The only reaction, response was that he had to be killed, nothing disciplinary at all.   I can't remember even Mr Chairman in my time ever of any slightest indication of any disciplinary action taken against any one of the askaris or any one of the policemen on Vlakplaas in my short stint on the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3160"><a name="pos3160"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Was the purpose of taking them to Komatipoort to have them shot, why was it done, why did that have to be done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3161"><a name="pos3161"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> When the poison did not work, I left Koos Vermeulen and the two victims on the farm at Kopfontein gate, that same farm that Koos always used, Koos Vermeulen always used, because he said I can go back to Lesotho he</p>

<p class="line" id="line3164"><a name="pos3164"></a>will deal with it now because the poison wasn't working and I left.   When we were called up, the whole group on 24 October to Middelburg in the Eastern Transvaal area, Koos rocked up at Middelburg actually at Grobblersdal where we eventually went and slept in empty houses of smallholdings of war veterans, El Alamein and I think another name was allocated to this little smallholdings, where we occupied empty houses for the duration of our operation looking for this ANC cadre who was apparently responsible for the killing of the two victims in the Ogies caravan, the two men.   Koos came up with them that Saturday, arrived when I arrived there here he was still with Peter and Vusi so on that Sunday Koos Vermeulen and myself, leading the rest of the group at Grobblersdal we departed for General Lothar Neethling's house to pick up, to find out what now, what's next, more poison from him.   When we returned that was administered and well, it also didn't work.   We then had to get to a deserted area of friendly branch commanders in the area which was Major Archer Flemmington at Komatipoort and in fact where Sizwe Kondile was burned, where Peter Mvusi was then burned, it was next to the Mozambique border and we decided to do it in that area with their help.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3165"><a name="pos3165"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> Mr Coetzee would you say that it was normal for people who were kidnapped by the Security Branch to be later eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3166"><a name="pos3166"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> If they, if there was any indication that they do not wish to co-operate fully.   Usually the way it worked if people were picked up, they were either handed over, or captured by the local Security Branch who would so-called "break them in" with all different third degree methods, and then after that if co-operating and if a case can be built</p>

<p class="line" id="line3169"><a name="pos3169"></a>up against them and they are not of very big significant value or high up in the ANC they would be charged and go through a court case, otherwise if a case could not be built up they would be eliminated and if they then are of value and decided to co-operate they would be handed over to Section C and more specifically Colonel Jack Buchner and then Colonel Trevor Baker who would then go through the so-called "terrorist album" with all the photos and particulars of the ANC cadres who left the country for training and then they would get this guy to co-operate and they update the files of all his friends who have been with him in exile.   On such and such a date this man was with me in Quatro Camp for hand grenade training for instance.   In that way it was, and only then thereafter they would be placed and based at Vlakplaas, handed over to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3170"><a name="pos3170"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> They would then be called askaris?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3171"><a name="pos3171"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Askaris, that is correct.   Askari is actually a Swahili, Arabic word meaning "black soldier".   I don't know how exactly it came about that they called them askaris, that name was given to them before I arrived at the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3172"><a name="pos3172"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE::</span> So this would be the process that Mr Mamasela would have gone through to become an askari, to become an informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3173"><a name="pos3173"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No, Mr Mamasela was actually an awaiting trial prisoner in Krugersdorp prison when Major Kruger of West Rand Security went there as a result of an incident in jail.  He was then still in South Africa as a member of student organisations in Soweto.   He then approached Mr Kruger and said that he is part of this student organisation and he can be of a great help.   He was there awaiting trial on robbery.   Major Kruger then checked his background, later</p>

<p class="line" id="line3176"><a name="pos3176"></a>involved Captain Jan Coetzee as an additional handler, and in August 1979 Joe Mamasela was released and then started with the South African Security Police.   He only thereafter infiltrated the ANC in Botswana and when he was caught out by them he then worked with Jan Coetzee, I don't know for how long and exactly when he was called out, but he permanently came to Vlakplaas in February 1982.   That is how he became an askari.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3177"><a name="pos3177"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Had he been caught out by then, did the ANC know that he was...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3178"><a name="pos3178"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> At some stage I believe so yes Mr Chairman, but as I say it was not my, it was not part of my duty and I can't give you exact particulars.   I just know that he was awaiting trial, according to documents coming from the Umhlazi docket which was made available to us, there's police memorandums in which states that he was an awaiting trial prisoner, he was recruited and then voluntarily without any force and then he infiltrated the ANC in Botswana only thereafter.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3189"><a name="pos3189"></a>Did he know at this stage as to what was going to happen to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3190"><a name="pos3190"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I'm sure Mr Chairman, I don't know whether exactly at that stage but I know whilst Koos Vermeulen prepared the drinks on the farm at Kopfontein he once spoke and says he's now prepared to co-operate and will help.   It was not in my hands, as soon as you are handed over to us there's a point of non-return and it could have only been used by him for the opportunity to convince us to set him free - that is how we saw it - and so his, his beggings if you can put it that way, fell on deaf ears Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3191"><a name="pos3191"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Will you agree with me if you say he knew as to what was happening to him this man actually started suffering at your hands at the stage when you loaded the tyres on the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3192"><a name="pos3192"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Well mentally or psychologically yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3193"><a name="pos3193"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Yes.  You have testified that you poisoned him and Nglameni many a times without success and you finally succeeded.   After how many days did you succeed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3194"><a name="pos3194"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The poisoning as I said happened on the 11th and the 12th and then the third lot of poison on the 25th on the Sunday after we came back from General Lothar Neethling's house and they were eventually killed on the Monday the 26th by giving them knock-out drops and shooting them down at Komatipoort next to the river where they were burned Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3195"><a name="pos3195"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> So that gives us a total of four days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3196"><a name="pos3196"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> From 11-26, 14 days, 15 days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3197"><a name="pos3197"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> In these 15 days these men, Selve and Peter Nglameni knew that an attempt was made to kill them and</p>

<p class="line" id="line3200"><a name="pos3200"></a>until finally it was done.   They knew this all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3201"><a name="pos3201"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No I would say Peter we brought under the impression, we handcuffed Vusi to Peter, onto Peter on their arms, telling Peter that he's got to guard Vusi and there is a possibility that after the 12th, I don't know exactly where Koos Vermeulen kept them, whether he, what place, it is possible that in that two weeks he might have thought well there might be a turn of events.   I don't know I'm only speculating Mr Chairman.   I must say yes it's possible as to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3202"><a name="pos3202"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Obviously they couldn't have known that there's been an attempt made at poisoning them, they wouldn't have known that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3203"><a name="pos3203"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No they wouldn't have known that Mr Chairman.</p>

I let Vusi sign three blank receipts of the kind that were used for payments to informers.   I let him use two different pens.

<p class="line" id="line3214"><a name="pos3214"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Why didn't you assassinate him, why did you allow him to suffer all this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3215"><a name="pos3215"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Mr Chairman I know there, there can be placed many why's that's true, why didn't we just put a bullet through his head, why didn't, why does one commander hit his victim with a spade on the head and the next one poisons his victims?   I can't explain that is just how it happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3216"><a name="pos3216"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Ja but weren't you sort of enjoying sitting there and seeing this man suffering?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3217"><a name="pos3217"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No I can tell you Mr Chairman the reason why our victims were doped and you can go to Sizwe Kondile, to Vusi and Peter in the end, was that I don't think there's any human being even in the Security Police that could look a human in the eyes who is sober and just put a gun to his head and shoot him at point blank, looking him in the eye.  Well I couldn't do it and none of my men could do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3218"><a name="pos3218"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> Well he was doped and why didn't you do it then, in the long run you did it in fact?</p>

If Koos Vermeulen comes forward Mr Chairman you'll see that is exactly the way it happens, the, whether there is method in the madness or madness in the method that's difficult to explain.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3248"><a name="pos3248"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Not a cover-up, I would say a danger, eliminating a danger of a person exposing the illegal activities of the South African Security Police.</p>

If I can then just seek the indulgence for the adjournment to be until 11:30 tomorrow morning.   I don't think the Mohema matter could take more than an hour or an hour and a half so we should be finished before lunch.   If it would please you Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3291"><a name="pos3291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Would you be inconvenienced in any way if this matter is adjourned until a little later tomorrow morning?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3295"><a name="pos3295"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> That would not concern Mr Jansen and I'm wondering whether we can do that in his absence?</p>

So I think he has to be present when this will be done.   Mr Chairman in conclusion this takes care of today's work.   Tomorrow it would be the Ace Mohema incident plus the submissions on behalf of Brigadier Willem Schoon and Major Eugene De Kock.   That is all that is left for tomorrow.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3308"><a name="pos3308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, today is the 23rd.  We continue with the application of applicant Dirk Coetzee and others.  Mr Chairman, as I indicated yesterday, we are going to deal with the submissions on behalf of Eugene de Kock as well as Brigadier Willem Schoon.  The two lawyers are here with us. Copies are here with us.  Copies are on the desk to each and every member of the Committee.  I am told that we shall commence with the submissions on behalf of Mr Willem Schoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3309"><a name="pos3309"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I appear again on behalf of Brigadier Willem Schoon.  As indicated in a letter to you last Friday, I will make short submissions on his behalf.  I had the submissions typed in memo form.  I understand copies have been made;  it is before you as members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3310"><a name="pos3310"></a>	My client Brig Schoon received notice on the 15th January this year in terms of section 19(4) of Act 34 of 1995 informing him of these proceedings as a person implicated or having an interest herein.  I have requested Adv Mpshe to provide me with a copy of the applications, which was granted, and for which I thank him.  I was given the applications of Mr Coetzee and Mr Chikalanga, so we assume that my client is not implicated in the application of Mr Nofomela.  This enabled me to take instructions from client regarding all the allegations therein implicating him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3311"><a name="pos3311"></a>	I have had the opportunity of consulting with Brig Schoon and it is apparent that he is implicated by Mr Coetzee in his written application in no less than 10 separate incidents for which amnesty is now being sought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3312"><a name="pos3312"></a>	My instructions of Brig Schoon is that Mr Coetzee is once again proving himself to be an utterly unreliable </p>
<p class="line" id="line3313"><a name="pos3313"></a>23.1 - 1A	witness/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3314"><a name="pos3314"></a>MR WAGNER	269</p>
<p class="line" id="line3315"><a name="pos3315"></a>witness and that the majority of allegations against my client are disputed by him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3316"><a name="pos3316"></a>	However, for my client to prove this, Mr Coetzee will have to be cross-examined in detail on each and every incident and allegation and in view of the many occasions where Mr Coetzee has testified in the past and all the different versions given by him to date, proper cross-examination in this regard could last a couple of weeks in my estimate. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3317"><a name="pos3317"></a>	This, the Committee has indicated to me, is quite impossible inter alia in view of time constraints applicable to this forum.  So it was decided that a largely limited cross-examination of Mr Coetzee will serve no constructive purpose whatsoever and that I should merely put on record on behalf of my client the issues disputed by him.  So I will deal with them one by one. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3318"><a name="pos3318"></a>	The first incident where my client is implicated is the murder of Peter Dlamini and Selby Mavuso which you will find on page 7 of the papers.  In this regard Mr Coetzee alleges that Brig Schoon gave the order for the elimination of these two victims.  I wish to put on record this is denied by Brig Schoon as a blatant lie.  He has no knowledge of this;  it is simply denied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3319"><a name="pos3319"></a>	The next allegation is the incident on page 10 of your papers, the murder of Gonisiswe Kondile.  It is alleged by Mr Coetzee that Brig Schoon was involved in this matter and in the process gave him certain instructions.  This is also denied by my client.  My instructions are that he was not involved in this matter and that he never gave any instructions in this regard, as alleged or otherwise. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3320"><a name="pos3320"></a>	The next incident is the murder of Ace Moema which is</p>
<p class="line" id="line3321"><a name="pos3321"></a>23.1 - 1A	on/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3322"><a name="pos3322"></a>MR WAGNER	270</p>
<p class="line" id="line3323"><a name="pos3323"></a>on page 12 of the papers.  I have consulted with my client and my instructions at present are that he cannot remember this incident and due to a lack of time we were unable to investigate this matter fully and at present we are in no position to comment thereon.  If necessary, and if allowed, we can deal with this at a later stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3324"><a name="pos3324"></a>	The next incident is the conspiracy to murder Mr Marius Schoon, that is on page 19 of the papers before you.  My instructions are that my client has knowledge of this incident.  But, as far as he can remember, this was an incident initiated by Mr Coetzee himself.  Therefore my client denies the particulars of this incident as set out by Mr Coetzee in his papers. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3325"><a name="pos3325"></a>	The next implication is found on page 21 of the papers, namely the attack on Joyce Depalis house in Gaberone.  Brig Schoon denies that he had any involvement in this matter whatsoever and specifically denies that he gave any orders to Mr Coetzee as alleged by him. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3326"><a name="pos3326"></a>	The next incident is the kidnapping of one Joe Pillay, the incident described on page 23 of the papers.  In this regard my instructions are clear.  Brig Schoon admits his involvement in this matter and I am allowed to tell you that he has already applied for amnesty in this regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3327"><a name="pos3327"></a>	The next incident is the attempted kidnapping of an ANC member called General.  This is the incident on page 25 of the application papers.  It is alleged by Mr Coetzee that Brig Schoon gave the instructions to kidnap this person in Swaziland.  My client specifically denies this allegation and bears no knowledge regarding who gave such instructions, if any. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3328"><a name="pos3328"></a>	Then the incident on page 28 of the papers, the cover-</p>

<p class="line" id="line3330"><a name="pos3330"></a>MR WAGNER	271</p>
<p class="line" id="line3331"><a name="pos3331"></a>up of the murder of a diamond dealer.  It is alleged by Mr Coetzee that this person was murdered and that my client was informed regarding the particulars thereof.  My instructions are that Brig Schoon has no knowledge of this incident and that the allegations of Mr Coetzee in this regard is denied by him. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3332"><a name="pos3332"></a>	Then we have the cover-up of a shooting incident at Lindley on page 31 of the papers.  Mr Coetzee alleges that my client was informed of this incident and that he was  part of the subsequent cover-up.  My instructions are that Brig Schoon was in fact informed of a shooting incident, but that it was dealt with by other officials.  He denies that he was part of any cover-up whatsoever, or that it was done with his approval.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3333"><a name="pos3333"></a>	The last incident where my client is implicated is the one on page 44 of the papers, the theft of a labour union vehicle.  My client remembers that he received money from Mr Coetzee to be handed over to Colonel Van Rensburg, but my instructions are that he was brought under the impression that this was a private transaction.  He therefore denies any knowledge of or involvement in the unlawful actions as alleged by Mr Coetzee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3334"><a name="pos3334"></a>	If I am allowed, Sir, I have two further points which I would like to put on record.  It is on page 4 of the document before you.  I would like to put on record that three further clients of mine are implicated in the application of Mr Coetzee, they are General J J Viktor, Colonel J C Coetzee and Colonel R Krause.  They have not properly been notified in terms of section 19(4) of your Act.  Although Mr Mpshe faxed copies of notices in this regard to my offices the day before yesterday, it is</p>

<p class="line" id="line3336"><a name="pos3336"></a>MR WAGNER	272</p>
<p class="line" id="line3337"><a name="pos3337"></a>interesting to note that in this notices Mr Mpshe you identify my clients as potential victims.  I don't know whether that was seriously intended. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3338"><a name="pos3338"></a>	I have not been able to take instructions of these individuals in this regard, and therefore I have no option but to reserve all their rights.  However, it is noted that this Committee is apparently conducting its procedures without complying with the explicit provisions of the said section, which will most certainly raise a question mark regarding the regularity of these proceedings.  Thank you, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3339"><a name="pos3339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Are you in a position to tell us or draw our attention to what section of the Act you think has not been complied by this Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3340"><a name="pos3340"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Mr Chairman, that is 19(4).</p>
<p class="line" id="line3341"><a name="pos3341"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Yes, but in what respect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3342"><a name="pos3342"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Sir, people are implicated in the papers, in the application papers.  The way I read section 19(4) all such persons should be notified prior to the proceedings regarding the time, date etc.  My clients, they are in South Africa, their addresses can be established.  To me it seems as if no serious endeavour was made to contact these people before starting with these procedures.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3343"><a name="pos3343"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Of course you are wrong.  The Act does not say "prior to the proceeding".  That is your view.  The Act does not say prior to the proceedings.   If it says so it does not (indistinct) proceedings.  The Act is formulated in such a way that it accommodates even a situation where unexpectedly a person is implicated when nobody ever thought that such a person would be implicated.  In such a situation proper steps are taken to accommodate such a</p>

<p class="line" id="line3345"><a name="pos3345"></a>273</p>
<p class="line" id="line3346"><a name="pos3346"></a>person.  But what I am trying to say to you is, the Act does not say in every case a person must be notified prior to the proceedings, because it would have been a very impossible situation. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3347"><a name="pos3347"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I think you are required to be notified of the place where the hearing takes place and when and where that is possible that should be done.  To that extent I think that you were right.  But as my brother here has pointed out, contingencies arise where during proceedings names are mentioned which cannot be anticipated and it can't be said that because notice was not given prior to the hearing it nullifies or in any way diminishes the value of the work done by the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3348"><a name="pos3348"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Sir, may I respond to judge Ngoepe's remarks.  Of course he is perfectly correct.  If it is a situation where someone's name comes up unexpectedly during the procedures.  But with due respect the way I read this section, if the names are in the papers filed before the procedures.  The way I read this subsection the officials of this Committee should comply therewith before the start of the procedures.  But also, Sir, I merely say in my last remark, I think it raises a serious question mark.  I don't take the matter further than that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3349"><a name="pos3349"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I understand.   Mr Mpshe, is there anything you wish to say at this stage in connection with these submissions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3350"><a name="pos3350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, there is nothing I want to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3351"><a name="pos3351"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> These names do appear, don't they, Viktor, Coetzee and Krause, in the application papers?</p>

An impression may be gotten from what I have just read that you are saying that the Committee has told you that you would not be allowed to cross-examine Mr Coetzee, and if that is what you are saying I would be happy to know why you say that because as far as I know, people who so wish and people who have got interest in proceedings can have legal representation which entails that if they want to put questions to witnesses they are allowed to do so.  But of course, like in all other tribunals, be it a court of law or not, cross-examination must know some limits.  The Committee allows cross-examination, but like all other proceedings, no cross-examination can be limitless, but the point I am making to you is that the Committee has never barred anybody from cross-examining. Bearing in mind of course the fact that cross-examination must know limits</p>

<p class="line" id="line3360"><a name="pos3360"></a>275</p>
<p class="line" id="line3361"><a name="pos3361"></a>in all proceedings.   We have never barred anybody from cross-examining witnesses.  Neither did we, to the best of my recollection, and I want to make that point because you have been reading this thing into the record, you have raised it in the previous letter, let it be known that we did not bar anybody from cross-examining witnesses nor shall we do so.  In fact, we have drawn some guidelines.  This Committee has drawn some guidelines which advises practitioners and other interested parties as to how we intended to conduct our proceedings and it was in those guidelines that we indicated that people would be allowed to put questions.  That included legal representatives of people in your client's position.  We have circulated copies of those guidelines and I am sure Mr Mpshe would have given you a copy thereof.  So to the extent therefore that you are conveying or giving the impression that your client has been denied the right to cross-examine Mr Coetzee, I must tell you that that has not been the attitude of the Committee. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3362"><a name="pos3362"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Just to add to that.  The Act makes reference to the limited rights of cross-examination.  If you have had an opportunity of looking through the Act.  Subject to what the Act says nobody has ever been refused the right to cross-examine witnesses and in fact in a number of proceedings that has taken place.  Witnesses have been cross-examined.  Maybe you are not aware of that.  What we are against is unlimited cross-examination.  I mean the activities of your client span some years and the number of activities in which he was involved are multifarious perhaps.  And cross-examination would be within limits in respect of what he is implicated in and nothing prevents him from coming forward if he is not allowed to cross-examine, nothing prevents him</p>

<p class="line" id="line3366"><a name="pos3366"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> May I respond, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3367"><a name="pos3367"></a>	The reason why this is said in my notes as well as in the letter of last Friday was simply this.  When I and my client perused the application, we realised that Mr Coetzee, according to us, is not telling the truth in many incidents.  So we had to decide how do we prove that.  And I realised that the only sensible way would be proper cross-examination to attack this person's credibility.  But I wasn't sure to what extent cross-examination will be allowed.  Therefore I took the liberty of phoning you personally to discuss this matter with you, namely what would be our rights and you, I agree Sir, said there would be a limited right of rebuttal.  Although I wasn't sure exactly what would mean in practice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3368"><a name="pos3368"></a>	I also tried to phone your other brothers, I couldn't get hold of them, I tried on Friday, but I did get hold of Mr De Jager and I also raised the same problem with him, as to how are we going to deal with this evidence of Mr Coetzee.  Because it seemed to me that it is either a full cross-examination or nothing.  Because by merely putting a few simple questions to him would really amount to nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3369"><a name="pos3369"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> If there were documents controverting what he said you will be in a position to put those documents ....</p>
<p class="line" id="line3370"><a name="pos3370"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Sir, our problem is merely that the allegations are made that in just about all these incidents that Brig Schoon gave instructions.   Brig Schoon denies that.  He has got no documents to prove that.  He merely says he denies that.  Therefore I raised this issue with Mr De Jager and the suggestion was made that well, then we rather come here</p>

<p class="line" id="line3373"><a name="pos3373"></a>today and put the denials on record.  And that is why I say in my notes before you that it seemed as if a largely limited cross-examination in regard to Mr Coetzee will serve no constructive purpose and that is why we approached you on this basis. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3374"><a name="pos3374"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I understand your client's attitude in this matter.  I will just repeat that it is open for your client to make submissions to this Committee and put forward his version, he'd be at liberty to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3375"><a name="pos3375"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Sorry, Mr Chairman, do I hear you to say that what I have done here this morning has no evidential value and that I should rather get Brig Schoon here to say the same things that I have said today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3376"><a name="pos3376"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I think you've been a practitioner long enough to know the difference between submission and evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3377"><a name="pos3377"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, in that instance I will liaise with Mr Mpshe for an opportunity for my client to appear before you and to repeat what I have said here today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3378"><a name="pos3378"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> The advantage of him appearing and saying what he wishes to say would mean that Mr Mpshe and other parties might question him and clarify matters which they require clarification on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3379"><a name="pos3379"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> In the last instance I may just say I was brought under the impression that the matter can be dealt with in this way in order to expedite the issues, but I hear what you say.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3384"><a name="pos3384"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, the next practitioner is Mr Hugo, on behalf of Eugene de Kock.  The affidavit is before the Committee.  It is in the form of an affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3385"><a name="pos3385"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Mr Chairman, if I could possibly just interrupt at this stage.  The affidavit of Mr De Kock does not affect applicant Mr Coetzee's situation at all.  I think it is appropriate that I possibly respond at this stage to the submissions handed in by Mr Wagner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3386"><a name="pos3386"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You are perfectly right, Mr Jansen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3387"><a name="pos3387"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Mr Chairman, again I will just place on record that it is regrettable that the submissions or the factual allegations contained therein wasn't at least made by way of affidavit, because clearly in the form it presently is it surely can have no probative value at all.  Be that as it may, even if it does come by way of affidavit it is merely a matter of argument and we will deal with it in our argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3388"><a name="pos3388"></a>	Also if I may be permitted just to place another matter on record.  In terms of section 39, more specifically subsection (c) thereof, these proceedings are regarded by the Act as being on the same footing as that of a court of law insofar as its rules of contempt is concerned, and that includes the rules relating to sub judice.  It came to our attention that this morning on the media certain statements were made by another witness, a Mr Mamasela, in the same vein as is contained in these submissions.  I would respectfully request you to remind the press and the media that although generally commissions, the rules relating to sub judice as not as strict, that they do apply to this Commission, and that they should be very circumspect in </p>

<p class="line" id="line3391"><a name="pos3391"></a>commenting on the truthfulness or the untruthfulness of any evidence at this stage.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3392"><a name="pos3392"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Whilst I would like to give a considered reply, if it is necessary, to the point you are raising, for your purpose at any rate and for those who are present, I think they should note that this Committee pays no attention whatsoever to what appears in the media by people who make comments about what is proceeding here.  We have refrained from engaging in any debate in the press.  We have refrained from refuting whatever is being said in the press or in the media on matters that we are seized with.  So no matter what the media says or what others say about our proceedings, we pay no attention to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3393"><a name="pos3393"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Yes, I assumed that to be the position, Mr Chairman, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3394"><a name="pos3394"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Wagner, could I ask you, what is the intention of appearing in terms of section 19(4).  You've received a notice saying you are implicated.  Is your intention to come and oppose the application of Mr Coetzee to prove him to be an untruthful witness, or is your intention to come and put - whilst you have applied for amnesty - to make a statement to protect your client's rights and say well, I don't agree with what he is saying and I want to make it known that I don't agree for purposes of my own application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3395"><a name="pos3395"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGNER:</span> Thank you, Mr De Jager, I should have made this more clear.  My client is not opposing the amnesty application of Mr Coetzee.  But the fact is exactly the way Mr De Jager described it, my client, I've said this today here, he has applied for amnesty himself for certain incidents, but he can't apply for amnesty for something</p>

<p class="line" id="line3397"><a name="pos3397"></a>MR WAGNER	280</p>
<p class="line" id="line3398"><a name="pos3398"></a>which he was not involved with or has no knowledge of.  So therefore, to protect his rights in that regard against possible future prosecutions etc. it was my instructions to appear here and to put his denials regarding certain allegations and nothing more. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3399"><a name="pos3399"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3400"><a name="pos3400"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  For record purposes I would like to confirm that I am acting on behalf of Mr De Kock.  Mr De Kock is also placed in possession of a notice in terms of section 19(4).</p>
<p class="line" id="line3401"><a name="pos3401"></a>	Initially Mr De Kock's attitude was that he was not going to react since we are currently in the process of finalising his own application for amnesty.  As time went by it became apparent that there are certain far-reaching allegations which are being made in Mr Nofomela's application and I was thus instructed to bring to the fore Mr De Kock's version and submit it to you by means of an affidavit.   And I would now like to ask for leave and permission to read Mr De Kock's submission into the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3402"><a name="pos3402"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> ... necessary for you to read the affidavit since it is a document on oath we will treat it as we have treated other affidavits we have received, but you may wish to elaborate on any points that are contained in this affidavit in your address to us.  Perhaps for the purposes of record we will number this affidavit, EXHIBIT P.  The document submitted on behalf of Brig Schoon will be EXHIBIT O, even though that is not an affidavit.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3404"><a name="pos3404"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  The first part of the application deals with the history which gave rise to Mr De Kock's decision to submit this document.  He continues to</p>

<p class="line" id="line3407"><a name="pos3407"></a>deal with the allegation of Mr Nofomela which he stipulates under the ... Swaziland in November 1983.   Mr De Kock acknowledges that there has indeed been such an attack, that he was personally present at the time of the attack.  He refers to other persons, white officers who were involved, Warrant Officer Freek Pienaar, Sergeant Chris Rorich, Warrant Officer James Van Ziel and Colonel Chris Deetlefs, although in his affidavit he says that he was not physically present at the time of this operation and that he merely monitored the operation in the sense that the informant who provided the information to initiate this operation was controlled by him.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3408"><a name="pos3408"></a>	Mr De Kock also says that in this operation which Mr Nofomela refers to, a certain Mr McFaddon and ... Zwalibanda Nyanda were killed by them.  They killed them.  A certain MK cadre known as Lawrence in this operation succeeded in escaping and Mr De Kock says that it came to his attention that this person during cross-examination later by the ANC, or by interrogation by the ANC's security branch in Angola was killed. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3409"><a name="pos3409"></a>	Mr Chairman, Mr De Kock refers to the other incidents which were mentioned in Mr Nofomela's application, the so-called ... persons in Swaziland and it was approximately, according to Mr Nofomela, November 1985.   Mr De Kock says that he took note of this paragraph but he would like to point to the fact that at that stage he was the commander of Vlakplaas at C1.  Mr Nofomela's allegation is that this operation took place under the command of Colonel Jack Cronje.  If that was to be correct Colonel Jack Cronje was no longer in charge of Vlakplaas at that stage.  Mr De Kock concedes that this attack might have taken place, but his</p>

<p class="line" id="line3412"><a name="pos3412"></a>suspicion is that this attack probably took place in 1983 and at that stage Mr De Kock, to the best of my knowledge, was not yet in South Africa, and he was still affiliated to the Koevoet Unit in South West Africa.  In Mr De Kock's submission he says that he is clearly being implicated here to an operation that happened in 1983 while he was not in South Africa. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3413"><a name="pos3413"></a>	Mr Chairman, as far as the incident described by Mr Nofomela as the murder of Japie Maponya, Mr De Kock says that Mr Nofomela was on a continuous basis in several forums where he gave evidence that Mr De Kock was responsible for the killing of Mr Japie Maponya and that he was present when Japie Maponya was shot in the head by Mr De Kock at Vlakplaas. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3414"><a name="pos3414"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Hugo, you are probably not aware of the fact that the evidence was corrected there.  Mr Nofomela did say that he was not present and that the killing of Mr Maponya did not take place at Vlakplaas but in Swaziland, in his evidence before this Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3415"><a name="pos3415"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Mr Chairperson, Mr De Jager is correct, in the sense that I was not present here when he gave evidence yesterday but during the criminal trial of Mr De Kock Mr Nofomela for the first time conceded that up until now he had committed perjury in front of all the other forums where he had given evidence and that he was indeed not involved and he had not been present when Mr De Kock killed the other person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3416"><a name="pos3416"></a>	In his statement here he says that he was responsible for the killing of Japie Maponya and that he and Willie Nortje were involved in the death of Japie Maponya but that it did take place in Swaziland at a plantation near the</p>

<p class="line" id="line3419"><a name="pos3419"></a>Nasden border post.  He also says in this paragraph that Mr Nofomela is incorrect when he says that this operation took place under the command of Mr De Kock.  It is simply not true.  This operation was already ordered at the stage where Mr De Kock became involved in this operation.  This operation which gave rise to the unfortunate death of Japie Maponya was at an advanced stage when Mr De Kock arrived on the scene, and at that stage this operation was under the command of Warrant Officer Nortje who, according to Mr De Kock, in his affidavit was instructed by Colonel Johan le Roux who later became a general.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3420"><a name="pos3420"></a>	Mr Chairman, if we could just proceed to the so-called Lamontville killings or Chesterville killings.  Here Mr De Kock says that there was a total misrepresentation of the true facts.  He says that in actual fact he was asleep in a police barracks in Durban and that he was awoken early the morning by then Warrant Officer Willie Nortjie, Vermeulen and Makata(?) and informed that they had killed a group of people in a shooting incident. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3421"><a name="pos3421"></a>	Mr De Kock further states, which supports Mr Nofomela's allegation that before they left for Durban he arranged that an AK47 attack weapon should be drawn with the intention of using in the operation in Durban.  He says that the acquisition of this AK47 was with official permission, it went through the right channels and he goes further to say that he went and acquired this AK47 at the Security Branch Headquarters in Pretoria and he further states that when he went to fetch this AK47 it was clear to him, and he realised, that there was a large quantity of AK47 guns and magazines at the Police Headquarters which was available to them.  He says that he was not involved in the shootout and</p>

<p class="line" id="line3423"><a name="pos3423"></a>MR HUGO	284	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line3424"><a name="pos3424"></a>that a shootout happened on information received by Willie Nortje and at the time where he became involved. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3425"><a name="pos3425"></a>	Mr Chairperson, if you could just grant me the opportunity, I'd like to go to the so-called Amsterdam killings.  Here Mr De Kock says that Mr Nofomela is correct and he is giving a true reflection of the incident.  He further states under oath that the other person who was involved in this incident was Major Chris Deetlefs, Warrant Officer Labuschagne and a Warrant Officer Pienaar.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3426"><a name="pos3426"></a>	He also says that this incident took place after information had been obtained that the Piet Retief Security Branch and that branch was closely involved in this incident.  He also says that this operation was launched against ANC members who were previously responsible for planting landmines in the Eastern Transvaal and he says that when this operation took place they found that the people who were killed were in possession of hand grenades and that they also had AK47 rifles and other military ammunition and weapons. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3427"><a name="pos3427"></a>	 He proceeds to say as far as Mr Nofomela's allegation that Mr De Kock said that he did not believe in court procedure and that they should rather kill the people before the time, he says that he categorically denies that and he would not have said that they should proceed to just murder people at random.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3428"><a name="pos3428"></a>	Mr Chairperson, if I could also just go over to the next incident where Mr Nofomela referred to the abduction of Glory Sedibe or a certain September.  Once again Mr De Kock  says that Mr Nofomela is correct.  There was such an operation planned. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3429"><a name="pos3429"></a>	Mr Chairperson, Mr De Kock further states in saying to</p>
<p class="line" id="line3430"><a name="pos3430"></a>23.1 - 1B	you/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3431"><a name="pos3431"></a>MR HUGO	285	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line3432"><a name="pos3432"></a>you that this operation was planned and executed under the instruction of Brig Schoon and that Mr De Kock, acting on this instruction, proceeded in his turn to plan this operation and execute it.  Once again he says that there were other people involved with him, Mr Chris Deetlefs and a Warrant Officer Pienaar.  He then goes into detail to describe how there was a wrestling and Mr Sedibe resisted and how he was injured in the process.  For example he had a scratch over his nose, a deep cut over his nose, and that it took four persons to control him. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3433"><a name="pos3433"></a>	What is so interesting, Mr Chairman, is that Mr De Kock says that the intention was never to eliminate Glory Sedibe, alias September.  On the contrary he says in his submission that they wanted to retain him at all costs because they realised that he was going to be of such value to them and he was going to be able to provide them with valuable information.  He also says as far as the other aspect, which I marked the day before yesterday which you addressed, that the allegation of Mr Nofomela ... (CHANGE OVER TO TAPE 1 SIDE B) ... On their arrival at the police station in Swaziland, it was necessary for them to break into the police station since it was under lock and key.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3434"><a name="pos3434"></a>	For interest's sake he proceeds to say that in this process he was confronted by a young Swaziland police officer who was armed with a G3A automatic weapon which he pointed at Mr De Kock.  Mr De Kock in his turn drew his firearm and pointed it at this police officer and Mr De Kock succeeded in convincing the policeman to throw his weapon to the ground.  Mr De Kock further states that he does not know what happened to this G32 weapon, but it could possibly have come back to South Africa. </p>

<p class="line" id="line3437"><a name="pos3437"></a>	He also says Mr Chairperson that Mr Sedibe was then</p>
<p class="line" id="line3438"><a name="pos3438"></a>brought back to South Africa and in terms of section 29 of the old Internal Act was detained for a while and that Mr Sedibe in this time was dealt with by a Warrant Officer Freek Pienaar and apparently Warrant Officer Freek Pienaar succeeded in convincing Mr Sedibe to work for the South African Police, more specifically the Security Police. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3439"><a name="pos3439"></a>	Mr De Kock was then informed that Mr Sedibe, as a matter of speaking, had changed loyalties in the meantime and he was no longer loyal to the ANC but that he had decided to pledge loyalty to the South African Police and when Mr De Kock heard that he personally went and arranged that Mr Sedibe's wife and child be brought down from Mozambique to South Africa and he further states that he arranged himself for the wife and children of Mr Sedibe, were given false identity documents so that their lives weren't in as much danger when they returned to South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3440"><a name="pos3440"></a>	He also says that Mr Sedibe then joined the South African Police and Mr De Kock himself was responsible for that.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3441"><a name="pos3441"></a>	He confirms that Mr Nofomela is correct in saying that Mr Glory Sedibe, alias September, was indeed the brother-in-law of the current Minister of Defence, Joe Modise, or the brother of Mr Modise's spouse.  Mr De Kock also says in this sworn affidavit that Mr Glory Sedibe, in spite of the fact that Mr De Kock was aware of the fact that there were family ties between Mr Sedibe and Minister Modise that he never provided the Security Branch with any information about Mr Modise. </p>

<p class="line" id="line3451"><a name="pos3451"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Although this is a statement under oath by Mr De Kock, it is not challenged in cross-examination and the value of the statement I will argue in the written  heads that will be submitted at a later stage, suffice to say at this stage that it is interesting to note that Mr De Kock is making a point of the fact that Mr Nofomela lied under oath about the incident where Maponya was shot, which lie Mr Nofomela yesterday explained to the Committee.  This point is made by the same person who under oath misled the Harms Commission with Mr Mamasela to the extent that no report of any value could be brought out at that stage which allowed the Security Forces to continue with what they were doing for another four years after the Harms Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3452"><a name="pos3452"></a>	He also challenged all allegations against him in a criminal trial which had to last for over a year before he could be convicted, amongst others of this specific murder.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3456"><a name="pos3456"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> As far as this incident is concerned, the allegation that Mr De Kock would have disputed the allegations in his criminal trial are devoid of any truth.  He did not give a version with regard to the Maponya murder.  There was no version put to him and he did not deny anything and as was his right the evidence which was led was tested.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3460"><a name="pos3460"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, if the chair allows, the next matter that is to be dealt with is the matter of Ace Moema and that I leave in the hands of my colleague, Adv Jansen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3461"><a name="pos3461"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, as indicated previously, evidence will be led in full on this matter.  Mr Chairman, it is matter No 4 in the application.  It starts in the application on paginated page 12, typed page 8.  In the manuscript the incident is dealt with at page 107 paragraph 5.4.15.1, it is the matter of Ace Moema.  If I could then recall Mr Coetzee to continue his evidence.</p>

These are again affidavits  handed in at the Harms Commission.  The first one is by Mr Jacob Zuma, member of the National Executive Committee of the ANC, and the Chief of the Intelligence of the ANC at the time.  This affidavit deals both with the cases of Mr Ace Moema and the case of Mr Siswe Kondile and what was known</p>

<p class="line" id="line3466"><a name="pos3466"></a>to the ANC intelligence at the time concerning these two men.  If I may hand that up as EXHIBIT Q.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3467"><a name="pos3467"></a>	And again just to assist, Mr Chairman, as EXHIBIT R, an affidavit by Mr Martin Tembisile Hani, generally known as Mr Chris Hani, the Chief of Staff of Umkhonto we Siswe at the time, also an affidavit presented to the Harms Commission which deals with the matter of Siswe Kondile.  This document was not available to us at the time dealing with Mr Kondile's matter.  I would ask, Mr Chairman, with your permission, that it be seen in the light thereof.   There is nothing I think contentious in the matter, something that would be of interest to the Kondile family.  I think it is just for a matter of completeness at this stage, just to place before the Committee what was known by the ANC Intelligence Services at the time concerning Mr Kondile's disappearance.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3468"><a name="pos3468"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Very well, this will go in as Exhibit R.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3469"><a name="pos3469"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> May I then proceed with the evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3470"><a name="pos3470"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Yes, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3471"><a name="pos3471"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Mr Coetzee, do you know the name Ace Moema?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3472"><a name="pos3472"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3473"><a name="pos3473"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> From where do you know this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3474"><a name="pos3474"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> It was the name of an ANC cadre who came to Vlakplaas in the late 1981s, towards the end of the year, as a person that had been debriefed already through all the relative channels and he was then placed in Vlakplaas with me under my control.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3475"><a name="pos3475"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> So what would his work have entailed had it not been for the events that are described later?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3479"><a name="pos3479"></a>them in different areas as requested. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3480"><a name="pos3480"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Would he have been in a position comparable to that of Peter Dlamini?  As far as what he would have come to now of Vlakplaas and its operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3481"><a name="pos3481"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Absolutely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3482"><a name="pos3482"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> What do you know of the eventual fate of Mr Moema?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3483"><a name="pos3483"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Mr Chairman, I should just say he was a very observant, quiet, if I remember right, non-smoker, non-drinker and asked a lot of questions, which concerned me and the rest of the policemen at Vlakplaas.  At that stage I got the impression that there might be a hidden agenda.  Captain Koos Vermeulen suggested that we should take him out ....(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line3484"><a name="pos3484"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Meaning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3485"><a name="pos3485"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Meaning assassinate him, upon which I recommended that we have a meeting with Brig Schoon on the matter in his office in Headquarters, which we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3486"><a name="pos3486"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Was this a special meeting or was it one of those meetings that you had regularly I think on almost a daily basis with Brig Schoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3487"><a name="pos3487"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> No, it was a special meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3488"><a name="pos3488"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Just to consider this suggestion that was made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3489"><a name="pos3489"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3490"><a name="pos3490"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Tell the Commission what happened at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3491"><a name="pos3491"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Koos Vermeulen offered and suggested to assassinate Mr Moema, Isaac Ace Moema, as he was known, and the final reply of Brig Schoon was that Vermeulen should do as he seems fit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3492"><a name="pos3492"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Again would you be able to recall the exact</p>
<p class="line" id="line3493"><a name="pos3493"></a>23.1 - 1B	words/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3494"><a name="pos3494"></a>MR JANSEN	291	D COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3495"><a name="pos3495"></a>words used with Brig Schoon that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3496"><a name="pos3496"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> The whole conversation, not by word, but in broader context that is what it consisted of and the final was that Koos should do what he seems fit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3497"><a name="pos3497"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Would it have been clear to somebody in the position of Brig Schoon that you were conveying to him that you intended - or that Vermeulen intended killing Moema?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3498"><a name="pos3498"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> In no uncertain terms, for sure, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3499"><a name="pos3499"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> What was your personal attitude as far as the killing is concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3500"><a name="pos3500"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> If Koos sees his way open to do that, that he should continue with it in his group, which eventually he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3501"><a name="pos3501"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> So you accepted at that stage, you either expressly or tacitly approved of what was about to happen to Moema.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3502"><a name="pos3502"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3503"><a name="pos3503"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I hear you to say that he did not or whether he did tacitly approve?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3504"><a name="pos3504"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Whether he did.  What more do you know about Mr Moema's eventual fate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3505"><a name="pos3505"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> He accompanied Mr Vermeulen into the Eastern Transvaal region towards, as I said late that year, it must have been November/December and after they had been operating in the area he came back with his group.  Mr Moema was missing and he reported that the issue has been dealt with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3506"><a name="pos3506"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> To whom did he report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3507"><a name="pos3507"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> To myself and Brig Schoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3508"><a name="pos3508"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Who else was on his group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3509"><a name="pos3509"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> It is difficult to say, Mr Chairman, I cannot</p>
<p class="line" id="line3510"><a name="pos3510"></a>23.1 - 1B	remember/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3511"><a name="pos3511"></a>MR JANSEN	292	D COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3512"><a name="pos3512"></a>remember exactly,  but it was the usual Western Transvaal group with whom he operated in the area, names of people mentioned in exile was upon others Chris Mnisi, who defected to the ANC later, and as I say one should check records, I cannot remember exactly. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3513"><a name="pos3513"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> You don't personally know what knowledge Chris Mnisi has of the disappearance of Moema.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3514"><a name="pos3514"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> No, no personal knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3515"><a name="pos3515"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> But you accept that Chris Mnisi may be of assistance either to the Committee or the Commission as to  this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3516"><a name="pos3516"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Yes, that is true, and I know during the Harms Commission it was put to me that Mr Isaac Ace Moema only disappeared in February, three months later into 1982, after I have left the farm.  Now to my knowledge that is not true.  It happened during the end of 1981 whilst I was still on the farm and I can only speculate that the same method was used as I used with Peter for him to sign blank informant fees for a few months and that was then the version that was officially put over on enquiries, but as I say, I am speculating.  I know for a fact that it happened during my time, late 1981, just before I left Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3517"><a name="pos3517"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> In the context of your discussions with Brig Schoon and the Security Police operations at the time, do you have any doubt that Mr Moema was in fact killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3518"><a name="pos3518"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> No doubt at all, but that he was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3519"><a name="pos3519"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Again, as far as the political motive is concerned, did you at the time consider this as being necessary in the course of your work at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3520"><a name="pos3520"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Yes, to prevent the possible exposure, if in fact Moema would have defected back to the ANC and was a</p>
<p class="line" id="line3521"><a name="pos3521"></a>23.1 - 1B	plant/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3522"><a name="pos3522"></a>MR JANSEN	293	D COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3523"><a name="pos3523"></a>plant fro the ANC side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3524"><a name="pos3524"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Did you regard him as a security risk at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3525"><a name="pos3525"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Yes, in fact, I did.  I may just mention that at the Harms Commission, if I can remember correctly, the version that was put to me was that Mr Moema and Captain Koos Vermeulen was on an observation post on the Mozambican border and Vermeulen dozed off and when he woke up Mr Isaac Ace Moema was just not there and he accepted that he has defected back into Mozambique.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3526"><a name="pos3526"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> On behalf of who was that put to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3527"><a name="pos3527"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> If I remember correctly, Mr Sam Maritz appearing on behalf of the Police in the Harms Commission.  I think documents to that effect was drawn from Mr Moema's file.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3528"><a name="pos3528"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Perhaps, Mr Chairman, to help the members of the Committee about that, in Evidence Book 3, page 12, there is something to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3529"><a name="pos3529"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Thank you, Mr Mpshe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3530"><a name="pos3530"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Mr Chairman, these are, as far as I can remember, the findings of the Harms Commission and they deal with that affidavit, but that affidavit is - I know what affidavit is being referred to and I will attempt with  your permission to at least give you the reference in the Harms Commission before time of argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3531"><a name="pos3531"></a>	Mr Chairman, I may also mention at this stage, after the Harms Commission evidence and its annexures had been sought by a great many parties all over the country and in different institutions, because nobody had an actual comprehensive record of it, it was finally realised that the entire record that was at one stage under the control of the National Library in Cape Town had in fact during the course</p>

<p class="line" id="line3534"><a name="pos3534"></a>of last year been placed in the custody of the Truth Commission itself.  So these documents at the moment, or the one comprehensive record thereof is actually in the custody of the Truth Commission in Cape Town. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3535"><a name="pos3535"></a>	Thank you, Mr Chairman, I have no further questions on this incident. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3536"><a name="pos3536"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR JANSEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3537"><a name="pos3537"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Why was this man considered to be a security risk, because he asked questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3538"><a name="pos3538"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> He asked a lot of intelligent questions, as far as the operations and people on the farm was concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3539"><a name="pos3539"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Was that not out of curiosity to be better informed about the work he was doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3540"><a name="pos3540"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> He was extremely, as I say, he didn't mixed in with the rest of the Askaris in the usual manner.  He was, as I say, nervous, he was not drinking, he was not smoking, he was observing, he was not joining in conversations, whilst with my group and Almond Nofomela - on the specific questions I think Mr Nofomela might throw more light - and then thereafter Captain Koos Vermeulen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3541"><a name="pos3541"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> He must have realised it was dangerous for him to ask questions in the kind of situation in which he found himself unless he was a committed member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3542"><a name="pos3542"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Mr Chairman, as I say, his whole - all his actions did not - was abnormal.  He wasn't like the normal Askari coming to Vlakplaas after being debriefed.  He was a highly intelligent man, very reserved, as I say not at all a drinker and a smoker, the ones that you always got on Vlakplaas and you could see he was well-observing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3543"><a name="pos3543"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Those are among the qualifications that were required for Vlakplaas?  To drink and ...</p>

<p class="line" id="line3545"><a name="pos3545"></a>MR JANSEN	295	D COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3546"><a name="pos3546"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> To give the necessary doubt that this is possible a plant and not a real walkover from the ANC to the South African Security Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3547"><a name="pos3547"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> So what you are really saying is, he was suspected to be a plant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3548"><a name="pos3548"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> That's correct, that he was asked to infiltrate Vlakplaas on behalf of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3549"><a name="pos3549"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> What happens when there are suspicions of that kind, of an individual whom you have accepted in your ranks?  Is he never questioned about it or tested about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3550"><a name="pos3550"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> As I say it was discussed with Brig Schoon and then if questioned it should have been handed over to the people handling that and that was Colonel Jack Buchner and Colonel Trevor Baker who dealt with them before they passed them on to Vlakplaas.  But I would suggest that would have been the right way out, with hindsight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3551"><a name="pos3551"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> When he was debriefed in the first place and brought into Vlakplaas, at that stage they must have discovered that this man is sober, he doesn't smoke, doesn't drink, he is reserved, maybe intelligent.  Those factors must have been noted at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3552"><a name="pos3552"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> I can't say, Mr Chairman, but I accepted and I accept that the man, if he was a plant, was very well briefed by ANC Intelligence and wouldn't have been easily detectable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3553"><a name="pos3553"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And on the other hand he may be perfectly innocent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3554"><a name="pos3554"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Yes, he could have been perfectly innocent, that's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3555"><a name="pos3555"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You seem to have had some reservations about the fact that he ought to be dealt with ...</p>

<p class="line" id="line3557"><a name="pos3557"></a>MR JANSEN	296	D COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3558"><a name="pos3558"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> In a way, yes, Mr Chairman, and that is why I left it in the hands of Brig Schoon to decide and Captain Vermeulen to deal with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3559"><a name="pos3559"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Coetzee, you seem to suggest that no investigation was done because Brig Schoon did not instruct that such an investigation should be conducted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3560"><a name="pos3560"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman, he could have said this is the way forward from this point, from this point of suspecting this man to be a plant, that is correct, it was in his hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3561"><a name="pos3561"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Why could you not cause such an investigation to be conducted?  I mean you were able to ask Mr Nofomela to keep an eye on Mr Moema, why couldn't you have caused an investigation to be conducted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3562"><a name="pos3562"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> That was not my job at all.  I was just on the operational side executing orders, coming from my superior, Brig Schoon, and as long as I reported the matter to him it was for him to decide how forward on from there.  I was a Captain at the time and Brig Schoon a Colonel or a Brigadier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3563"><a name="pos3563"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Weren't you in charge of Vlakplaas at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3564"><a name="pos3564"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Yes, I was, Mr Chairman, of the farm itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3565"><a name="pos3565"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And were you not responsible for the functions of also ensuring that you didn't have security risks that Mr Moema?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3566"><a name="pos3566"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> If I pick up anything in the line of that to report it to my superior, which I did, Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3572"><a name="pos3572"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> If you had caused an investigation, a proper investigation to be conducted, to find out whether indeed Mr Moema was a security risk, do you think you could have found yourself facing a disciplinary inquiry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3573"><a name="pos3573"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Mr Chairman, it didn't work that way in our culture.   I can assure you that.  My duty was to report to my superior and in the (indistinct) they will decide how forward on from here and that was it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3574"><a name="pos3574"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> But didn't you know that Mr Vermeulen had an attitude towards blacks, Mr Coetzee?  You knew that Mr Vermeulen had an attitude towards blacks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3575"><a name="pos3575"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Absolutely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3576"><a name="pos3576"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> He hated - in your manuscript you make reference to the fact that he fanatically hated blacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3577"><a name="pos3577"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> That is true, 100% correct and I knew that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3578"><a name="pos3578"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And this was a person who was making a suggestion that this person must be removed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3579"><a name="pos3579"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3580"><a name="pos3580"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And you still went along with that suggestion without in fact advising Brig Schoon who was not residing at Vlakplaas, who did not have the relevant facts about the operations of Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3581"><a name="pos3581"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> We fell directly under Brig Schoon's command and we reported directly to him.  I was not on a unit on my own in security headquarters, but fell under the Section C command of Brig Schoon through which I received my orders,</p>

<p class="line" id="line3583"><a name="pos3583"></a>MS KHAMPEPE	298 	D COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3584"><a name="pos3584"></a>by whom I was briefed and debriefed, and who had to take decisions who was coming to the far.  I couldn't decide which Askaris was to come to the farm.  I just had to report back to him and he decided.  I couldn't go against that. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3585"><a name="pos3585"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Was there anything which prevented you from advising Brig Schoon to cause such an investigation to be conducted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3586"><a name="pos3586"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> As a Brigadier in charge of Section C I think it wasn't my duty to advise him.  I think it was common knowledge by such a senior officer who was on that desk long after - I think for a period of eight years - several commanders after me served under him.  He was an old Security man and I think it wasn't for me to sort of tell him or suggest to him what I should think he should do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3587"><a name="pos3587"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did you feel no responsibility for one of the men who were under your command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3588"><a name="pos3588"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> I did feel responsibility for them, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3589"><a name="pos3589"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And you've told us this was a nice, intelligent man, so why didn't you speak up on his behalf?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3590"><a name="pos3590"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> I did speak up and this fact I think worsened it because it more supported the fact that from their point of view and our point of view that he was a plant and not fitted in with the rest of the Askaris.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3591"><a name="pos3591"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Coetzee, perhaps the question I am going to ask you now has been covered by the Committee members, but I will ask it for completeness sake.  In your application you state that although I personally indicated that I did not want to do the killing myself and then it goes on, why did you not want to do the killing yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3592"><a name="pos3592"></a>23.1 - 1B	MR COETZEE:  /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3593"><a name="pos3593"></a>MR MPSHE	299	D COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3594"><a name="pos3594"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> I can't give any specific reason.  I was not 100% happy in the way it was dealt with but it was not in my hands.  Koos Vermeulen volunteered and Brig Schoon gave him the go ahead and it was not for me to go against superiors.  I wouldn't have been on Vlakplaas any longer.  I would have been seen as posed - or being a security risk, with my knowledge of the farm being transferred from the farm as a result of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3595"><a name="pos3595"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Can it have been that one of the reasons perhaps is because you felt this man was resourceful and intelligent you didn't want to have anything to do with his elimination?  Is that not possible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3596"><a name="pos3596"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> It is difficult to say what went through my mind, Mr Chairman, at the time.  I could just make out when debriefed in exile by Mr Jacob Zuma that this was a very highly respected and highly trained ANC officer in the Intelligence.  But at the time as I say, I just didn't see my way fit and open to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3597"><a name="pos3597"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> In fact, Mr Coetzee, you've told us you've never done it.  You've always stood by and instructed somebody else to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3598"><a name="pos3598"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> There was always volunteers.  I always said right through this hearings, Mr Chairman, that I am just as guilty, just as responsible as all the men under my command, but as all officers we were sitting on our backsides because there was enough non-commissioned officers who would volunteer to do the necessary work, whatever has to be done.  And in a case where it comes to shooting and Koos Vermeulen is present, like in the P Dambusi(?) case, you never had to look for volunteers.  Koos was there to do the job.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3599"><a name="pos3599"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> What was Koos Vermeulen's rank?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3601"><a name="pos3601"></a>ADV DE JAGER	300	D COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3602"><a name="pos3602"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> A Captain, but by one year my junior as it works in the police set-up and so he fell under my command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3603"><a name="pos3603"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So you could have instructed him not to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3604"><a name="pos3604"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3605"><a name="pos3605"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Especially if it was left in his discretion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3606"><a name="pos3606"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> That is correct.  That is why I say I am just as guilty as all the other parties involved, especially the men under me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3607"><a name="pos3607"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Isn't it so that the true reason why you had reservations about his killing was that you yourself was not exactly convinced that this man was disloyal, was a double agent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3608"><a name="pos3608"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> I would say yes, Mr Chairman, although I had my reservations and it did worry me a little bit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3609"><a name="pos3609"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> But surely if you were convinced you would have had no hesitation in approving of his killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3610"><a name="pos3610"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> That is correct, and that is why I because of my reservations I suggested that we discuss it with Brig Schoon and take it from there onwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3611"><a name="pos3611"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Didn't the flimsiness of the evidence as it were against him trouble you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3612"><a name="pos3612"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Mr Chairman, it was always difficult for me as a result of the (indistinct) to know what exactly - I knew nothing about his debriefing, what he was involved in, by whom he was captured and what his debrief involved.  And I was for sure not there to question superiors who did the necessary debriefing and go into detail.  I was there to express my concern to my superior who was Brig Schoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3613"><a name="pos3613"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> But the way I understand you Brig Schoon did not in fact give an order that this person be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3614"><a name="pos3614"></a>1B	MR COETZEE:  /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3615"><a name="pos3615"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE	301	D COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3616"><a name="pos3616"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> If he in our language, I might just refer you again, Mr Chairman, if necessary, to our way of speaking and the way we understand things, as I put it in the Mxenge trial I think, if he says to Captain Koos Vermeulen, as he did, do as you seem fit, and that means nothing else but if you want to then kill him, you suggested that we assassinate him, go ahead with that.  Koos Vermeulen couldn't have understood anything else from that meaning of words but only just that ....(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line3617"><a name="pos3617"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> But that surely, Captain, that's stretching it a little bit too far out of the common sense.  If a person says in ordinary life do as you see fit, surely we understand him as saying that well, the discretion is yours.  If you feel that this man is a danger kill him.  On the other hand, if you don't want to kill him, then don't.  Surely that's what it means?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3618"><a name="pos3618"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> He said to him do as you seem fit and as I said, knowing Koos Vermeulen, that meant one thing only, kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3619"><a name="pos3619"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> But if Koos had not killed him Brig Schoon would not have queried Koos because he had not given specific instructions that the man be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3620"><a name="pos3620"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Well, I can't comment on that, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3621"><a name="pos3621"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> It troubles me because it seems to me that there was in fact no such order from Brig Schoon who was your senior and the discretion to kill or not to kill was left to somebody who was your junior and in the end really it comes back to you.  You could have, without in any way offending Brig Schoon, have stopped Koos Vermeulen from killing that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3622"><a name="pos3622"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> In theory maybe yes, with hindsight, but the</p>
<p class="line" id="line3623"><a name="pos3623"></a>23.1 - 1B	way/....</p>
<p class="line" id="line3624"><a name="pos3624"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE	302	D COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3625"><a name="pos3625"></a>way it worked in the culture, for sure not, and if the Chairman would allow me just to repeat this quote as I have done before about our way of speaking when it was explained by the notorious Craig Williamson to a presiding officer, exactly this same kind of conversation in the Security family which would have a complete different meaning in normal life.  He says, and if you will allow me:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line3626"><a name="pos3626"></a>"It is a very devious way of talking. It is something that Security people will understand"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line3627"><a name="pos3627"></a>And also:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line3628"><a name="pos3628"></a>"I think for people in the profession, people who speak deviously to each other, and who have a very intimate rapport with each other, understand intimately, understand very well what is going on in this type of conversation".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line3629"><a name="pos3629"></a>And this was Craig Williamson at my internal trial on 10 June 1985, Volume 6 page 292 and 293.  So if Brig Schoon gives the green light to - he overrules me.  He is our boss.  If we are there, I am not the boss, Brig Schoon is the boss and if Brig Schoon gives Koos Vermeulen the green light to say do as you think fit, that gives Koos the green light and he knew that Isaac Ace Moema will then be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3630"><a name="pos3630"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I know that people communicate with devious ways, but that's something different.  It is one thing to give a definite order through devious ways, which is what you are reading from the paper, but the situation you are dealing with now is completely different.  You yourself is saying - you are telling us that Brig Schoon said well, do as you see fit, what does that mean?  What does the "do as you seem fit" mean, if simply to say well, if you want to kill him, kill him.  If you don't want to kill him, don't</p>

<p class="line" id="line3633"><a name="pos3633"></a>kill him.  There can't be an order out of that, Captain.  You cannot read a specific order to kill out of that kind of communication.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3634"><a name="pos3634"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Mr Chairman, if Koos indicated that Isaac Ace Moema must be assassinated, and Brig Schoon gives him an answer of "Do as you think fit", he would have very well known that Isaac Ace Moema are going to be killed, nothing else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3635"><a name="pos3635"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Anyway, what is alarming in this whole thing is that without any proper investigation or even an attempt at investigating and testing this man to find out whether he was in fact a plant or not, a decision is taken so flippantly and a man's life is put to an end.  I am alarmed by that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3636"><a name="pos3636"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> I can understand it, Mr Chairman.  I think in those days a black man's life meant absolutely nothing.  One can see it clearly out of what I am explaining at the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3637"><a name="pos3637"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Are you saying therefore, Mr Coetzee, that your office, as a commander of Vlakplaas, prevented you to order an investigation to be conducted to verify information which had such catastrophic and fatal consequences of declaring someone to be a double agent, you couldn't have done that?  You couldn't have ordered such an investigation to be conducted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3638"><a name="pos3638"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> My duty on the operational side falling under Section C - Vlakplaas was not something on its own, it fell under Section C Security Headquarters, Brig Schoon, and as I say, my job was to report to him and it was for him as a very old, experienced - more experienced Security man than I was at that time, to decide how forth from here onwards.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3641"><a name="pos3641"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> But you could have conveyed to Brig Schoon your particular reservations about Mohema's double agency status.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3642"><a name="pos3642"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Well, I actually also agreed that there was some concern as a result of his actions, but not to the extent that Koos Vermeulen did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3643"><a name="pos3643"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You agreed there was some concern.  You didn't oppose your objection.  You didn't say, you don't think that action should be taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3644"><a name="pos3644"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> No, I didn't say that, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3645"><a name="pos3645"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3646"><a name="pos3646"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> As I say, I had my sort of doubts and I was worried about Mr Isaac Ace Mohema's behaviour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3647"><a name="pos3647"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You worried and a man dies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3648"><a name="pos3648"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3649"><a name="pos3649"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You were worried about his behaviour and you let a man die, is that what you are telling us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3650"><a name="pos3650"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3651"><a name="pos3651"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Which really boils down to this, that you could have avoided his death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3652"><a name="pos3652"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Well, in theory I can assure you, Mr Chairman, in the Security set-up in that farm set-up, in that culture set-up, I wouldn't have last long and might be I might have ended up where some other of my black colleagues ended up after posing a threat to the Security Police as clearly proved when I left into exile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3653"><a name="pos3653"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You would be faced by your junior.  You would have told your junior not to proceed with this.  So what threat could that be to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3654"><a name="pos3654"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> I could not have overruled Brig Schoon's ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3655"><a name="pos3655"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> No, Brig Schoon, the matter was only referred to</p>

<p class="line" id="line3660"><a name="pos3660"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> But if you had decided there was no need for Brig Schoon to decide on the matter, if you yourself thought there was insufficient evidence or information about this man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3661"><a name="pos3661"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Well, I think in my manuscript I said some of the other policemen, and I think it came from Almond Nofomela, and other policemen, who also expressed their concern, as a result of that I felt it my duty to accompany Koos and discuss it with Brig Schoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3662"><a name="pos3662"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> But Mr Coetzee, your evidence is quite clear, Brig Schoon did not say go and eliminate.  He said you and Vermeulen were to use your discretion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3663"><a name="pos3663"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> No, it was a specific instruction to Koos Vermeulen do as you think fit.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3674"><a name="pos3674"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Well, I think one should ask that question to Vermeulen, with all respect, Mr Chairman, and Brig Schoon, put it to him.  I can't answer for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3675"><a name="pos3675"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Captain Koos Vermeulen made a report to yourself as well as Brig Schoon about him having taken care of Mohema.  Did he report to you as to how the "taken care" was done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3676"><a name="pos3676"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> No, not as far as I can remember in explicit words, but by doping, getting knock-out drops from General Lothar Neethling, I can only assume shooting him at point blank and burning him, but that's only an assumption.

<p class="line" id="line3688"><a name="pos3688"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> The whole set-up with the Askaris ... (CHANGE OVER TO TAPE 2A) ... because of the exposure of the farm.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3691"><a name="pos3691"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> My conclusion will then be correct that Ace Mohema is taken care of because of the reasons you have advanced, avoiding embarrassment to the Security and concealing the illegal operations then at Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3692"><a name="pos3692"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Yes and the more bigger one, that if he was a plant that he would defect back to the enemy and which would cause extreme danger to the Security Policemen on the farm if a counter attack was planned as a result of the information, he might have carried back if he was a plant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3693"><a name="pos3693"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Coetzee, I am saying this to you because I find it difficult to can extract any political motive in this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3694"><a name="pos3694"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> The whole Security Police set-up was a political set-up.  It was a set-up that kept the government of the day in the chair and everything surrounding that, exposing it, embarrassing the Security Police, embarrassing the apartheid government is all political.  All our activities on the farm involved the political operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3695"><a name="pos3695"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, no further questions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3697"><a name="pos3697"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Schoon, was he stationed at Vlakplaas or where was his office and where was he stationed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3698"><a name="pos3698"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Brig Schoon's office was in Security Headquarters, as I explained he was the Officer Commanding Section C.  I think there was five officers at the time in Section C, and I was the officer who dealt with the small section of Section C, which in fact was very small, and that was Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3699"><a name="pos3699"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Were you stationed at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3700"><a name="pos3700"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> I had a desk in Security Police Headquarters, right opposite Brig Schoon's office, where I sat with the</p>

<p class="line" id="line3703"><a name="pos3703"></a>other officers, Colonel Jack Buchner, Colonel Trevor Baker, Captain Willie Botha, Stan Hancock and from there the administration was done and on the farm the Askaris was only based on the farm.  So I reported to Security Police Headquarters every morning to my desk there, had my morning meeting, debriefing and briefing with all the other officers and then departed for the farm. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3704"><a name="pos3704"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And Buchner's officer was sort of next to yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3705"><a name="pos3705"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> No, in the same office.  We shared, we five officers serving under Brig Schoon shared one office right opposite the passage of Brig Schoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3706"><a name="pos3706"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And you never thought of asking Buchner listen, youv'e debriefed this man, how did you find him, do you think he is trustworthy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3707"><a name="pos3707"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> I never questioned any work that Colonel Buchner or Colonel Trevor Baker did at the time ....(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line3708"><a name="pos3708"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Not questioning him about it, asking him over tea.  Do you know this man, what do you think about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3709"><a name="pos3709"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> No, I did not, never ever in my time being placed at Headquarters.  That was the job of Brig Schoon.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3712"><a name="pos3712"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> They were the people who debriefed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3713"><a name="pos3713"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> That's right, in the second stage after he has been dealt with with the branch where he was arrested, of which I had no knowledge.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3720"><a name="pos3720"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> No, I cannot, but if I remember correctly, it was weeks and not months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3721"><a name="pos3721"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> And would it have been more than for instance one week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3722"><a name="pos3722"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> For sure more than one week, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3723"><a name="pos3723"></a>I know he spent some time with Almond Nofomela and if I remember correctly, Joe Mamasela, when he went over to Koos Vermeulen's group, he spent some time with Joe Mamasela too and his men and his fellow colleagues. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3724"><a name="pos3724"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Prior to going to Schoon, did you have one conversation with Vermeulen about Mohema, or did you have  more conversations with him regarding these suspicions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3725"><a name="pos3725"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> He expressed his concern on several occasions if I remember correctly, how many times I don't know.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3738"><a name="pos3738"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> In that case perhaps we should take a short adjournment.  The Committee will adjourn for half an hour which means we will resume at a quarter to two.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3758"><a name="pos3758"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> This morning you read the application and you indicated to me that you'd like to say something to this Committee, you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3759"><a name="pos3759"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOEMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3760"><a name="pos3760"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You are free to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3761"><a name="pos3761"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOEMA:</span> Two things.  In the course of the proceedings I was scribbling some notes but I decided probably to shelve the notes and just speak to impress upon the honourable Judge, Chairperson and every member of the proceedings how one feels about the case itself.  And in the course of the</p>
<p class="line" id="line3762"><a name="pos3762"></a>evidence given by Dirk Coetzee, he did mention the fact</p>
<p class="line" id="line3763"><a name="pos3763"></a>23.1 - 2A	that/....</p>
<p class="line" id="line3764"><a name="pos3764"></a>MR MPSHE	312	T M MOEMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line3765"><a name="pos3765"></a>that Isaac Moema, my brother, was somebody who was very intelligent, very quiet, non-smoking person, non-drinking person.  And what happened on the basis of that observation, on the basis that probably at the time of his capture and taken to Vlakplaas he did not fit within the mode of their culture and therefore he deserved to die, to be killed.  I feel strongly about it.  My mother is not here today, my father is (indistinct).  When we left this morning from home she said, she cannot stand the pain of listening to the proceedings about how gruesome a death her son died.  So she said go and listen and reflect on what the proceedings are and express her deepest I don't know what, but very, very painful for her and now she is waiting at home, she does not know what is happening, she expects us to get back to her and tell her something.  I am not quite sure when I get back home what is it that I will tell her to ensure that - to find solace in whatever I am going to tell her.  But if being intelligent, being quiet is a criteria for one to die then it really brings to light the kind of anarchy that reigned at the time at Vlakplaas.  It caused for me to begin really questioning why is it that I have to explain something that is so obvious and the facts are there for everyone to see. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3766"><a name="pos3766"></a>	In 1991 I think, at the time of the Harms Commission, if I am not mistaken, 1991, I am sure, yes, I was called in to give evidence at the Harms Commission, and I went through this, I am going through this again.  My mother wasn't there, I was in London, she was here, Dirk was in London, he couldn't give evidence to the Harms Commission because of his conditions of being in exile, I was in exile, I was called in to give evidence, I did give evidence.  But what</p>
<p class="line" id="line3767"><a name="pos3767"></a>23.1 - 2A	was/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3768"><a name="pos3768"></a>MR MPSHE	313	T M MOEMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line3769"><a name="pos3769"></a>was clear was the ineptitude, the obvious lack of sensitivity of the pain that one was going through, listening to what was going on and clearly from the word go the Harms Commission was a farce, and I am not trying to construe that the Truth Commission is a farce.  But one would expect much more from the proceedings that are going on here.  My mother would like to know where her son is, why was it that he had to die.  If they felt he was a threat to the State, there was recourse to the legal proceedings, the criminal justice was available if he was a criminal, or if there was any case against him.  If it was just felt that he was a threat to the State at the time, a charge should have been laid against him and he would have gone through the normal court proceedings and be sentenced like many others that got sentenced and went to Robben Island and many other prisons that we have in the country.  So that by saying this one is not - I am not so much here to protest, to send any protestation against the applicants in the amnesty, that is not what I am here for. I am here to express the deepest - Your Honour, I left the country because of the pain I'd gone through.  I've lived in exile, I've lived under very harsh conditions, but this is one of the worst moments for me to be sitting here to try to say how the family feels about what has happened and ... (witness distressed) ... can I round off by asking two questions and hopefully I will be able to let my mother who is at home probably sleep in peace.  Just two questions.  Can somebody go to her and say I have committed the murder, I am sorry.  The second one is, can somebody take us or take her to say this is where your son is, this is where his last remains are, if there are any remains that are still available for one to see.   I am not</p>

<p class="line" id="line3772"><a name="pos3772"></a>in a position to proceed.  I've got a whole list of questions that I wanted to ask to satisfy myself, but I don't think I should proceed.  And I would like to thank you all.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3773"><a name="pos3773"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Thank you.  We do not have before us the kind of information that would give answers to your question.  We are still open to evidence that would throw light on who it was precisely that killed your brother.  We have heard the evidence of Mr Dirk Coetzee about who desired the death of your brother.  Precisely where he was killed, we have nobody here present who can tell us.  And it unfortunately may remain one of the secrets that have been buried with your brother.  But there is the Reparations Committee.  It is possible that they may be able to go and visit your mother and perhaps give counselling to her if it can be of any assistance to her.  At present I can think of nothing else that can be done to assist your family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3774"><a name="pos3774"></a>	Mr Mpshe, is there anything else that can be done in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3775"><a name="pos3775"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, what stands to be done is that I  have to get in contact with the HRV Committee, they are the people who can do something in this regard, and I will see to it that it is done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3776"><a name="pos3776"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> More particularly if it is at all possible for people who do counselling to go there and talk to the family and be of assistance, if they can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3777"><a name="pos3777"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> It is possible, it can be done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3778"><a name="pos3778"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOEMA:</span> A bit of information.  I have submitted, and that's something that was lacking, mention was made of the presence of Mr Chris Mnisi when he left with Captain Vermeulen.  I have made a submission of the affidavit that</p>

<p class="line" id="line3780"><a name="pos3780"></a>MR MPSHE	315	T M MOEMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line3781"><a name="pos3781"></a>Mnisi made, but the other wing of the Truth Commission, probably it would come handy to the proceedings exactly what he says in the affidavit.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3782"><a name="pos3782"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Mpshe, you may also enquire whether Mr Chris Mnisi can be traced, if he is still in the land of the living.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3783"><a name="pos3783"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I will do so, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3784"><a name="pos3784"></a>	Mr Chairman, then that rounds up the day's work and perhaps more appropriately, the week's work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3785"><a name="pos3785"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Thank you gentlemen for being of such assistance.  You've taken great pains in compiling the documentation that makes the task of this Commission that much easier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3786"><a name="pos3786"></a>	Let us finalise one or two things as to the written submissions that my Committee would like from counsel. When can that be done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3787"><a name="pos3787"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Mr Chairman, as indicated initially, I thought that two weeks would be enough for me to prepare Mr Coetzee's written submissions and in those submissions I would include Mr Chikalanga's matter.  I indicated the 7th February.  I could be in a position to submit my Heads at that stage.  I would possibly maybe just ask until that Monday.  It would give me an extra weekend, it would give me three weekends basically, so if I could then submit my heads by the 10th February.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3788"><a name="pos3788"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I will not be in a position to submit Heads by the 10th.  I would say at the earliest on the 14th February, which is the next Friday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3789"><a name="pos3789"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Very well.  Since counsel for Nofomela is given until the 14th, let that be the date by which Mr Jansen you may also do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3790"><a name="pos3790"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I will then do so and I</p>

<p class="line" id="line3792"><a name="pos3792"></a>316</p>
<p class="line" id="line3793"><a name="pos3793"></a>will serve on my learned friend and ensure that all the members have copies and I will ensure that Mr Mpshe has enough copies also to forward to the other interested parties that may want to have a look at them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3794"><a name="pos3794"></a>	Mr Chairman, then just also to conclude.  We still owe the Committee some answers in relation to Mr Chikalanga's application.  I have arranged to see Mr Chikalanga over the weekend.  I will ensure that those answers reach you first thing within the course of next week.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3795"><a name="pos3795"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Ladies and Gentlemen, this brings to an end these hearings and I thank all those who have assisted;  the panel of interpreters who have so ably carried out their work in assisting us and I want to thank everybody else who made it possible for things to move smoothly during these hearings and thank you very much.
