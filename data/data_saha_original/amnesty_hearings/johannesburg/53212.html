<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>DR KLEPP:   (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR RICHARD:</span> Dr Klepp, for the sake of the record would you please describe your qualifications and specialisations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> I have an MBChB degree from the University of the Witwatersrand, a diploma in Forensic Medicine from the College of Medicine of South Africa, a Fellowship in Forensic Pathology from the College of Medicine of South Africa, and a masters degree in Forensic Pathology from the University of the Witwatersrand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  Where do you work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> I work in the Gauteng Department of Health and as a Senior Lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And during January 1988, where were you employed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> I was working both at the Soweto and the Johannesburg Government Mortuaries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> As what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> As a Specialist Forensic Pathologist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And what were your duties at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Among my duties was obviously to do post-mortem examinations on people who had died of unnatural deaths.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So do you consider yourself to be a Specialist Pathologist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  Now before you had a post-mortem report, do you recall the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Vaguely.  It was 11 years ago, but I vaguely remember a post-mortem that I did do at Diepkloof with Dr Gluckman in attendance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When was that done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> I conducted a post-mortem examination on body DK158 of 1988, on the 27th of January 1988 at the Diepkloof Mortuary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Dr Gluckman is quite well-known in the profession, isn't he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Yes, he is, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And Dr Gluckman and you did this particular post-mortem together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Well Dr Gluckman watched me conduct the post-mortem examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And why was Dr Gluckman there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> I do not know, he must have been requested by somebody, but I do not know who.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  Now if you look at the post-mortem report on Schedule of Observations, it's page 52 of the bundle, there various injuries are described, the first one being a 6mm round wound.  Now what would that wound have been caused by?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Wound 1 in paragraph 4 is a gunshot entrance wound to the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And where was the exit wound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Wound 2 is a description of the external wound which was over the ramous of the mandible on the right side, as I'm indicating at the moment.  So in other words, we had a gunshot entrance wound over the top of the head on the left side that exited the jaw on the right side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now that gunshot was consistent with somebody standing above the person, is there anything more you could say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> I am unable to say in what position the two people were to each other, the deceased could have been sitting, standing, he could actually have been standing with the head bent forward.  One cannot say that the person was necessarily above the individual when he was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does page 57 show you the entrance wound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> I don't know whether I have page 57.  Are there some photographs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Yes, photograph 57, as one looks at the book the photograph at the bottom shows the gunshot entrance wound with the hair around the wound having been shaved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Could you make any comment as to how far the firearm was away from the victim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> I do mention on page 4 of my report, under Specimens Retained, that I took the hair from around the wound and I handed it over to the investigating officer for examination, the Police Forensic Laboratories in Pretoria.  Had they found powder, in other words burnt and unburnt gunpowder, I could then give you an estimation, a rough distance from which the head was shot.  If there was no powder, and I don't have the result of that test, well then it would be considered to be a distant shot, which means over one arm's length from the deceased, but I don't have the result of whether it was positive or negative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  Now if we proceed to page 53 of the bundle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Again what I have in front of me is not numbered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Page 3 of the report is page 53.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Right, I do have it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> There we come to item 12, and it says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>"Trachea contained blood stained secretions"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>What is that consistent with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> There was blood in the air ways which could have come from the head.  In other words with the gunshot wound to the head, the skull was fractured and blood could then have passed down through the back of the throat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>	Another possible sight of where the blood could have originated is when one has sustained a severe gunshot wound to the head you actually get shunting of blood from the periphery of the body to the lower pressure system of the lungs and exudation of blood into the secretions.  So it could either have come from below or from above.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And then we proceed to paragraph 13 where you describe</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>"Sub-plural haemorrhages involving all lobes of the right lung."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What are they consistent with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Sub-plural petechial haemorrhages usually occur in conditions of anoxia where a person has had difficulty breathing.  In this gentleman the cause of them would have been the gunshot wound to the head, which would have caused respiratory embarrassment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So that would mean that the gunshot did not cause instant death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> It did not cause instant death, as is borne out by my findings of inhalation of blood in paragraph 13 on page 3 of my report, and also the large sub-endocardial haemorrhage in the left ventricle of the heart.  One finds those in conditions of shock or low blood pressure.  If one dies immediately one does not usually find those, whereas if one has sustained a severe injury where the blood pressure had dropped and that blood pressure is maintained at a low pressure for a period of time, that's when that haemorrhage occurs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I know it's difficult, but would you be able to give us any indication as to how long this gentleman took to die?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> I'm unable to do that, the only way that that could be assessed is if I had been called to where he had been found dead.  Oh no, you're not asking me how long he had been dead for, how long - no, I'm unable to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well can you give us an estimate?  You have referred to a period of time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you talking about five minutes or half an hour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> I would talk about more in the region of half an hour or longer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thanks.  I cannot be absolutely accurate on that, that's a rough estimation, but if somebody were to have seen him half an hour later and he was alive it's certainly consistent with that, if he was seem alive two to three hours later, it's also consistent with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But it's certainly more than five minutes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> I do believe so, yes.  The part of the brain that the bullet passed through was not one of the vital centres, in other words it did not go through the mid-brain or the ponds or the medulla oblongata, so it would have taken just a little bit longer than had it gone through a vital centre which would have been instantaneously fatal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now paragraph 17, there you make the comment</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>"The stomach contains undigested food."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What does that mean to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> When a person has just eaten a meal and the food is now in the stomach, on opening the stomach would appeared to be undigested.  One can on occasion actually identify what the person has eaten, one might for instance see rice particles or peas or meat.  I don't in this specific instance exactly say what was in the stomach, but it appeared undigested, in other words it looked as though it had just been swallowed.  Had it had a more fluid consistency and had undergone digestion, I would have called it partially digested food.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What are the various answers that you could have put to that question 17, stomach and contents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Well it can either be undigested, partially digested, it could be empty, it might have contained blood, it could have contained mucous, it all depends what's there.  It was actually undigested in this gentlemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when does the digestive process stop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Stop or start?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Stop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Well it would have stopped in this gentleman when he died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Not at the time of the gunshot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> It's a difficult issue, I've actually brought some references about it, that food is digested and undergoes digestion from the time one eats it.  In other words chewing food mixes it with saliva and the digestive process begins.  When it's in the stomach it continues to be digested.  There are however a number of factors which alter the digestive process, one of which, which is important to consider, is stress.  I don't know the circumstances of this death, but if for instance during the meal or shortly after the meal this man had been subjected to stress, in other words either verbal or physical, the whole digestive process would come to an end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>	We on occasion see people who had been lying in hospital for a week, still with stomach content in them because the whole movement of the stomach actually stops.  I'm not sure if that has answered your question, but it certainly would have been slowed down by a stressful situation and certainly when he had been shot, I would not have expected much movement out of the stomach into the intestines of food.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Can you make any comment as to a time between death and the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> The time of death and shooting, I think that's a question that was put to me a bit earlier, how long in other words would it have taken him to die after the gunshot wound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> From the time that he ate the from to the time that he died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> It is extremely difficult.  I have brought with me today a reference by Bernard Knight who is possibly the doyen in the world in forensic pathology.  If you would just like to hear the first sentence of his article of stomach emptying: "With one exception this controversial topic could be dismissed summarily as being quite irrelevant".  There are so many different factors that one cannot put much emphasis on the actual level of digestion of food and linking it, in other words estimating that interval.  So in other words, I found it undigested, he might have been shot five minutes after eating the food, but he could also have been shot an hour or two hours later.  I cannot exclude that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So that means that the impression that I was under from conversations that death was within an hour of him eating of the meal, is incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> I spoke to you as you know, telephonically a week ago and you put the question to me and since then I have gone to the references and this is what I found to be the overwhelming feeling.  In a normal individual a meal would take about two hour to be digested and pass through in four hours, but due to various factors, for instance if you've eaten a fatty meal it's retarded, it you are stressed it's retarded, if you've had a lot of fluid with your meal, the movement through to the intestines will be speeded up.  Because of these various factors one cannot be categorical, but usually undigested means that you've died soon after being shot, but as I say, with the exceptions that I have mentioned today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So I cannot give any indication as to how soon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> I'm afraid not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Unlike last week, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think one can make it even more difficult for you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is possible, and I stress now that I am not making any finding on this, that this young man arrived on the scene and suddenly to his horror discovered somebody there whom he was terrified of...</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... and that he remained in the company of this man for some time ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before he was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now that would, what you've just told us, lengthen the process of non-digestion if he was under a state of stress for the whole time, you couldn't estimate at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Absolutely not, I agree with that wholeheartedly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you, doctor.  Do you recall how the man was dressed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> I did not have any clothing on the body, the clothing is usually removed prior to the post-mortem examination by the police.  There was no clothing on the body when I examined him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... and things of that nature, that's not part of your function?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> No, the clothing is usually removed off the bodies before I get the body.  If a gunshot has gone through the clothing, the investigating officer would then submit that piece of clothing to be examined for residue.   On occasion we do get bodies with clothes on if it's deemed prudent.  I remember with Stompie, Stompie had his clothing on when I examined him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you examine the surface of his skin on his side at any point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> I examined the whole of his body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you notice anything on his skin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> If we could just go back.  Paragraph 4 of my report is a description of the external appearance of the body, I think we've gone through 1 and 2 which is the gunshot wound through the head, I found blood exuding from the nose.  I then got - number 4</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>"Scattered areas of abrasion which involved the forehead on the right side, the upper and lower eyelids of the right eye and a few over the right zygomatic arch, which is the cheekbone, they appeared punctate"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>I'm sure you don't want me to go into that.  You're asking about on the right side of his body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Then there were - some of those look graze-like.  Then we had the other gunshot wound on the arm, which is wound 5, and I found the bullet at 6.  Then we carry on to the annexure</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>"There were abrasions which extended from just below the bullet wound ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>No, that's on the arm again.  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>"There was bruise with associated abrasion below the gunshot wound.  There was a scratch abrasion at the dorsa aspect of the right hand and there were two abrasions over the right shoulder superiorly."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>So to answer your question as to whether there were abrasions on his body, there were none.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And you wouldn't have noticed any residue of sticky-tape or ..."</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Stick-tape I wouldn't be able to pick up.  Do you mean if stick-tape had been on an individual?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> I found nothing on the body which made me suspicious of a gummy material on the body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now let's return ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> But again the bodies can sometimes be washed off if they are grubby.  The body may have been washed off prior to my examination, but they shouldn't actually have washed off anything which looked remotely suspicious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The sticky-tape you've been asked about, there's a suggestion that he had a radio transmitter strapped onto his body with that tape that one uses for that purpose, and that this was pulled off him some time before he was shot, some hours before he was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Yes.  I didn't see anything like that, and you can appreciate we do have a number of elastoplasts found on bodies, which we then have to remove.  They often don't leave any mark on the body once we've removed them, but I did not find anything suspicious.  It doesn't mean that there wasn't or hadn't been sticky-tape on the body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I take it if he walked around for two hours after it had been removed, with his sweatshirt on, that would probably rub off anything which ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> It could well have, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> If we go to paragraph 4, you describe: "injuries over the right zygomatic arch"</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>What are they consistent with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> These are consistent with either a fall to the ground once he'd been shot - I am unable however to exclude that there hadn't been a fall to the ground prior to him being shot, it's due to any hard object coming up against that part of the body.  It could even be a punch, but it's more likely to be a fall to the ground due to my description of punctate.  In other words if one falls onto gravel or a tarred road and the surface is slightly rough, one would get that appearance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>	I mention too that some of the abrasions have a graze-like appearance, meaning that there had been a slight dragging possibly of the body, you know of the face on the hard surface.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> If the body had been dragged any distance, would you have seen any injuries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Oh certainly.  I don't feel that this is consistent with dragging of the body, it's more likely that when the face fell onto the ground, that there was some movement in that area.  There were no extensive scrape abrasions on this body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You've told us that death was not instantaneous.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So if he was lying on the ground there may well have been slight movements that could have caused all of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Absolutely.  And simply the face coming onto the ground initially was sufficient to create what I've got here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Are there any signs that the deceased was assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> All the injuries that were on the body are described in paragraph 4.  There are the two scratches which I mentioned on the annexure of the report.  The scratch over the dorsa aspect of the right hand could mean that there had possibly been an altercation and the scratch ensued.  And the two abrasions over the right shoulder, superiorly again very small, 2,5cm x 2cm, the other one 1,5cm x 5cm, these could have been sustained when, again, he possibly fell to the ground, but anything hard up against it.  But this is not a typical assault, this man has not been beaten with sjamboks or kicked, we don't have large bruises.  The prominent finding really is the gunshot wound which appears to have gone through the head and then into the right arm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Last point is paragraph 23 on the post-mortem report, 54 of the bundle and the last page, I think of the post-mortem report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> There you describe the kidneys</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>"The right kidney, the medulla are congested, there is a streaking of the cortex"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Yes, this is another feature which one gets when a person is in a condition of shock or low blood pressure, like the sub-endocardial haemorrhage that I mentioned.  The kidney has an auto-regulatory mechanism whereby instead of sending blood to the periphery of the kidney, it has a short-circuit and sends it back to the medulla.  So congestion of the medulla and streaking of the cortex is yet another sign in the deceased that he did not die immediately, but was in a state of shock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So overall to sum up what you've said, from the post-mortem report the person died at a consequence of the gunshot wound to the head over a period somewhere between 5 minutes and half an hour after the shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Or longer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Or longer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And the contents of the stomach are not an indication of how long it was between the shooting and the last meal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR RICHARD</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well again this is a difficult question to answer without having seen the scene, is it possible that after the shot he fell down and lay, apparently immobile, that people may have thought he was dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> It is.  I mean he has sustained a very serious gunshot wound to the head which has gone through both halves of the brain and he would not have mobile or particularly active, he may have lay there very still.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the fact they see there's blood in the head they think he's dead now and leave him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">DR KLEPP:</span> Probably yes.  He certainly would have been very unconscious and if no breathing was seen, he could have been considered to be dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> No questions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The doctor has very kindly brought two copies.  If anybody wants to look at it it is available, but I'm going to call this Exhibit B.</p>

<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>	Now during 1987, if I recall correctly you said that from the beginning of the year till the middle of the year you were in detention, is that not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I was arrested in 1986, November and I was released in June '87.  That is what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  Now during 1986 you already knew Mr Dube, is that not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now on your release during 1987, did you hear any rumours regarding his bona fides?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Rumours with regard to what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> As to whether he might or might not be an informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> No, that I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Who did he say he was at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Sorry, I've a technical problem with my headset.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Will the technician ... Can you hear what I'm saying and the translation clearly now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I only hear English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will the interpreter please talk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The applicant can hear.</p>

<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When you met Pat, how did he describe himself, who did he say he was, what did he say he did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't understand what you want me to say, what you want to know rather.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you know Mr Dube as either Ithumaleng, Mr Dube or Pat or Silver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I knew him as Pat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you ever hear him being referred to as Silver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> As who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> As Silver.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> No, I didn't know that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Would you agree that your suspicions regarding the deceased, Sicelo, after his so-called disappearance in October 1987, were based on pure speculation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> It's best for me to say suspecting him and speculation it is different, but the fact that he disappeared brought some concern to us, it was a cause for concern, his disappearance that is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And it was his disappearance that was your primary concern, and whether he had reported on you or not, correct or not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't follow your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What was your concern as a result of his disappearance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> You want to go back then I will go back to what I have already said yesterday.  Must I?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When he disappeared what was the result in your mind?  It made you concerned, didn't it, yes or no?  I think you've said yes yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And what was Mr Dube's principle concern as a result?  Was it to do with finding him or recovering the weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What was Mr Dube's concern, was it to locate Sicelo or to locate the supposedly missing weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Firstly, the concern was based on his disappearance, stemming from the fact that he was a cell member and knowing the cell's regulations that you don't disappear for no apparent reason because you are working together with other people who have weapons as well.  In other words if you are not present and we don't know as to where you are you pose a problem to us.  And the security was of vast importance, therefore your disappearance becomes a concern to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you know he had been arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Yes, I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This is in October?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That's very true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you know if he had been released?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What, you knew he'd been released?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you know that he - you knew he had been arrested in October, did you know that he had been released from arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Yes, I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I'm not certain as to when inasfar as time is concerned, but I knew that or I was aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Shortly after his arrest or only when you saw him again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I heard immediately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That he'd been released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> From whom did you get that information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't quite remember as to who uttered that to me, but I know that happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You didn't get it from the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> But I thought you were aware that I did not see him immediately, so how could he have told me that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now if I tell you he reported his arrest and detention and assault to his then attorney immediately thereafter, would you be in a position to dispute it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> No, I won't dispute it because I was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now - and if I put it to you further that his decision to leave Soweto and to stop living at home was so as to avoid further arrests, would you able to dispute that, comment on it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I won't dispute that either because I don't know his whereabouts, or I did not know his whereabouts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> But you also agree you could have done far more to locate him than what was done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I hear the statement, I am not sure if you are asking me a question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand what you have told us a few minutes ago, your feeling was that he as a member of the cell should have told you what he had done and where he had gone because the practice was if he was to go away for more than a day he should report it, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> But you had been asked to look for him, hadn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I agree to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And my proposition is you could have done a lot more to find him than was done, do you agree with that or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I explained to you that I did not run all over the place looking for him because he should have come to me as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When the deceased came to  your house on the day, that Sunday, were you not personally anxious to find out where he had been between October and January?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I did have interests.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you ask him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So that morning you made no effort at all to question him, if I recall your evidence from yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That is true what you've just said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well how is that?  I find it very hard to understand that you now see a member of your cell, someone you had worked with, who disappeared for three months and he reappears but you don't say to him;  where have you been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I thought I'd addressed that yesterday, am I supposed to repeat it today again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You did what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> When he presented himself to us on Sunday I only said to him that there is an important thing that we have to discuss.  I don't know as to what he was planning.  He looked like he was planning to go somewhere and I said to him he must go and come, in fact there is something we have to him about.  We let go of him and he came back.  I wanted him to explain during Dube's presence as well, as to where he was.  Another thing I highlighted was the last time we spoke about him we did agree that when he comes or when comes back to us we should ask him and he should account.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>	I think what I did was right because I wanted him to furnish the explanation in the presence of the commander, not to me alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you were his commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That I don't dispute.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And he had disappeared for three months, now suddenly you had a chance, he was there, but you say you didn't ask him you said; oh go away and come back later and we'll ask you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That's what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry Mr Richard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>	Do you mean to say that you did not even indicate to him that this important thing you wanted to discuss with him was about him having disappeared?  You did not indicate that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You just said there was an important thing which you had to discuss with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now we've heard a lot of evidence about a chain of command, were you not his commander and accordingly he was responsible to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I will again repeat, it was so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And we've heard Mr Dube say that he couldn't report to Mr Dumakude, he could only report to Mr Grasskopf, wouldn't the same have applied to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Please don't compare the two situations, that is Dube's situation with Aquino and mine as well, don't compare the two situations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You had recruited him hadn't you?  You recruited Sicelo, you made him a member of your cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were responsible for him.  You were the link between him and Mr Dube.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you never asked him a thing yourself, you never asked for an explanation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Am I supposed to lie, am I supposed to lie now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No.  Does this mean that you and Mr Dube had already come a decision about the deceased and that you weren't really interested in finding out where he'd been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Those are your words, they are not mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>	Did the deceased have anything with him when he came to see you that morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I did not take note of anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You didn't see him carrying anything or anything in his pockets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I did not notice anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> If he had had a gun or something with him, would you have been able to see it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> If I have my gun with me you will not be able to see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Do you know what he was wearing that day, do you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't remember what he was wearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> If I say that according to the documents with which I've been briefed, he was wearing a T-shirt and some grey or black trousers, red socks and red shoes, would you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't want to commit myself to that because this happened a long time ago, so I will not sit here and say I remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when he arrived, did you take any notice as to whether he was alone or whether people were with him that he left outside, or did he just come to your door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> When he arrived when, in the afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> That Sunday morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> He was alone, because I walked him out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> But when he arrived, did you see whether he was with anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I did not see anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now did you ask him where he was going to go once he'd left you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I thought I explained that he said he wanted to go somewhere and I said to him; go and come back.  That I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> If you were suspicious of the deceased at that stage, didn't it occur to you that if he arrived in the morning then went away, he might be setting up a trap?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> It could have been up to him that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Somebody you suspect arrives at your house in the morning, you talk to him very briefly and he goes away, you stay at your house and you tell him to come back to your house later that afternoon, didn't that arrangement worry you if you were suspicious?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't know what you want me to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well more than to come back to  your house, didn't you know that your commander was going to be at your house that afternoon, and here you were telling this man to come back there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I did not see anything wrong or any problem in what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you didn't suspect that he was setting up a Security Police trap, you saw no danger of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Now I don't know what to say or what statement must I utter, because from here onward I'll be lying if I have to elaborate on this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't have to lie to elaborate, you can tell the truth.  Is the position that you didn't suspect him of anything, you saw no reason to suspect a trap?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> To suspect him does not mean I must be a coward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you suspect him of working for the Security Police then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I was not certain about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I didn't ask you whether you were certain, I asked you whether you suspected him of working for the Security Police when he came to your house in the morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That did occur.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mm?  You did?  But you didn't ask him where he'd been, you didn't ask him where he was going to, you merely arranged for him to return to your house at a time you knew your commander was going to be there, is that the factual position as you put it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I explained that as you've said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now for how long was he away from your house between the time that he left in the morning and the time he came back, how many hours was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't how much you want me to say because I did say that he came in the afternoon towards dusk.  That's what I said.  As to how long, maybe I'll have to start to refresh my mind and count hours, an hour, like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> We know that there were seven hours in the afternoon approximately, at what time in the morning did he leave you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> He arrived around eleven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So he had an entire day, eight or more hours to do what he liked without any surveillance or control over him, and you were happy with that situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> No, when you refer to happiness, I don't know what you're talking about now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Very well, then when he came back that afternoon, who did he meet with first, you or you and Mr Dube, or Mr Dube?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> He found us outside, the two of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And were you present when Mr Dube started searching him and talking to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I did explain that I was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So you didn't see the discovery of this alleged radio transmitter, two-way radio?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I did say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As soon as he arrived did Mr Dube say go and phone the others and tell them to get ready?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> When he arrived he greeted us and asked us as to how we are doing and faring and he said to me I must go in and phone the other two, and I did just  that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, did you ever see the radio transmitter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I thought I explained to you that it was broken and in pieces, I could not explain, but I was told subsequently as to what it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So by the time you saw it, it was in pieces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Chairperson with respect, I think this line of questioning doesn't take us anywhere.  The witness explained in detail yesterday that actually what happened was he was sent into the house, when he came back he was shown pieces of what was said to be a transmitter, and I'm not sure where my learned friend is leading by being repetitious unnecessarily.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Nor am I ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Well, on what basis can you confirm that it was a transmitter, other than the say-so of your commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> The witness did explain that he was shown pieces of something he was told was a transmitter, he did not know whether it was a transmitter or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did Mr Dube tell ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>CHAIRPERSON</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>"He showed me a broken device and said that the deceased had been carrying a transmitter"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What happened to the broken pieces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't remember what happened to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> How was Sicelo behaving at this stage, what was his demeanour, was he fearful, cheerful, worried?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> When I came back I found the situation changed, he was not as comfortable as he was in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did your commander explain why he had smashed the device?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> He explained to me afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Then is it correct that you and Mr Dube had a discussion and it was then, while Mr Dhlomo was inside the house, that Mr Dube ordered you to execute Mr Dhlomo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you discuss it and debate it or did he just give an express command, this will happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I thought I explained that yesterday, that we did briefly discuss it.  It was not just an absolute order, I had also had an input.  We talked briefly about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Well what was your input, what did you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't know what you want me to say.  Are you referring as to whether I agreed or disagreed with the opinion or with that what he said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have just said: " I also had a input", and you are now being asked what you mean by that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> He explained the situation that he discovered that device and what we have to do is that, because what we had agreed with earlier on in our meeting was we will have to ask him.  What I said to him was; "you see this thing of interrogating him will get me into trouble or problems because if we had already discovered something like this, I don't see why we should be talking any further with him."</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So your attitude was that there was nothing really to say, you had found this device and that was it, the decision was made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That's what is surfacing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Were you angry with Sicelo on being told that he was an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Were you angry with the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't have an appropriate word here, I don't have an ideal word to explain this.  I think I was devastated.  I don't think being angry and devastated means the same thing, but I think I was devastated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You've told us, I think, that Dube gave you a copy of his statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> What I said is that he showed it to me because he had a copy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  And in his statement Dube says the deceased said that this so-called transmitter belonged to his friend's, is that what Dube told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> If my memory serves me well he first said it was his friend's, it belonged to his friend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who did he say this to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> To him, Dube that is, not me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did Dube tell you this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> During that brief time he did not say that, he told me that afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Were you present at any stage when Sicelo confessed his alleged complicity with the Security Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Confessing or confirming to who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you hear the deceased at any stage say to anyone within your earshot he worked for the Security Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> He did not say that in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So you relied entirely on Mr Dube's words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I may say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did Dube tell you on that occasion, during the brief discussion, that he worked for the Security Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Yes, he said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> During the brief discussion or did he tell you later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> He told me during that brief discussion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did Mr Dube make any mention of the missing guns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> What I heard was the guns were confiscated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When did you hear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I did say that he mentioned that to me at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who mentioned it?  Who mentioned it, Mr Dube or the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Mr Dube was relaying to me what the deceased had said to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is that also during the brief discussion you had with Dube?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Why was it necessary to fetch Mr Zungu and Mr Tshabalala to witness the execution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> If I give a different answer I will be lying, but first before he told me that he discovered what he discovered, I had already went inside the house to phone them, and when we were leaving it was automatic that we should fetch them or they should be present or they should come.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's automatic that you should want two other people to observe you committing murder, is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't see any problem there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now where was your weapon at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> You mean where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> In what way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Where was your weapon, was it in the cupboard, in your pocket?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> It was on my waist where I used to keep it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And where was it that morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I always have my weapon, I never leave home without it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So you were happy to have a weapon on your person even though there was the possibility that the police might be aware, through Mr Sicelo Dhlomo, where you were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I have no problem or I had no problem with that because I was in a fight.  Whether I had it or not, that was my business and against them, fighting against them.  So that does not shake me one bit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So from you say then, when you walked away from your house off to the school and to fetch the other two and onwards towards the tree, you were quite happy to wear this weapon, carry this weapon through the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Do you think I carried my gun to show off or to walk pompously about that?  Apartheid did not please us, I don't understand your line of questioning.</p>

<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> It was  Makarov.</p>

<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Yes, that's the one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They are large weapons, aren't they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> It's not large to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> It's not large to me.</p>

<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Sorry.  Who did you go and fetch first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I first went to Sipho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now you found him at home, what did you tell him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I told him that we have to meet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you explain why you had to meet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I told him that Sicelo is around and he's with the commander presently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you tell Sipho that you and your commander had already decided to execute him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> No, I did not say that to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was there ever any discussion with Sipho about whether it was necessary to execute him or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't know as to how you expect me to answer this, because I did not say that to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I asked you ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying the question of execution was never raised with Sipho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That's what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When Sipho saw what was going to happen, did he say anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't understand as to what you want.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You took the deceased to this tree and at some point in time Mr Tshabalala must have become aware of what was going to happen, did he ever say anything about whether the deceased should or should not be executed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> What I said yesterday was, when we left Sipho and Sibongiseni were not told, I did not tell them rather as to what the decision was, and when we got there we did not have any discussion in relation to that, we only executed the action and brought to fruition what we discussed with the commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand your evidence, when you got there the deceased was sitting under the tree and you just pulled your pistol from out of your belt and shot him in the top of the head, there was no discussion, nobody had an opportunity to say anything, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That's what I said.</p>

<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> No, that's paragraph 4, where there Mr Dube states the circumstances.  At paragraph 5, there Mr Dube states he, Mr Dube, referring to himself as</p>

<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> If I may say that I did phone to tell him that his disappearance is posing some problems to us.  These are technical things, because I did explain or say that I'm the one who brought this to his attention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What counsel is putting to you, if you would just listen to him, is that Mr Dube in his statement says that he rushed to the three cell members at Emdeni and that they then took a decision.  Now on your evidence that is not true, is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That is what I was trying to explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's not true, is it, he didn't rush to the three other members in Emdeni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I'm the one who called him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you not prepared to say that what Mr Dube says is untrue?  Do you feel you must back him up as far as you can?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I'm not backing him up, I'm not supporting him either but what I'm understanding with Mr Dube is that he is not having a clear recollection of all the events and the sequence in which they took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right, so as a result of his not having a clear recollection, is what he said in his statement untrue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> This is why I answer the way I do, because I have realised that he is not having the clear recollection of all these things.  If I was backing him up or supporting him for that matter, I will be concurring with his evidence through and through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you know that the others are not going to back that up.  So you are not prepared to say, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> When Mr Dube gave his evidence, did he adhere to this version of the facts that he went to the others, after the others and ...?  Did you listen to his evidence when it was put to him did he adhere to it, did he say "yes, I stand by that statement"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> In other words are you suggesting that I must turn around my evidence and agree to what he has said or agree with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> No, no, no, you don't understand what I'm trying to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Dube gave evidence, you listened to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Yes, I listened to him although I was not here all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you're being asked did he in his evidence say that he rushed to the three cell members in Emdeni or did he give a different version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't know how to reiterate this, because I did say that I'm the one who called him.  How else must I put this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are being asked about the evidence Mr Dube gave here which you listened to.  Did he say in that evidence that he rushed to the three cell members in Emdeni?  He was asked about it, wasn't he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> He was asked and how am I featuring in that questioning of Dube because I'm telling you what I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You know what he said yesterday.  You can't suddenly shut your mind to things you're being asked about what was said.  Don't you want to answer the question?  ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Chairperson, the witness said in response to the question that was he listening to evidence, that he did listen to evidence but at times he did go out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's not what he said earlier, but we'll leave it there if you want to abide by that answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Very well.  When in May 1997 you signed your application and read it, didn't you know then that Mr Dube's statement was incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> You asked me yesterday about this statement and I told you that this is a very general and broad statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Sitting before this Committee you have given a version very different to what is said in this statement, and I refer you particularly to paragraph 5 where you associate yourself with the statement</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a>"We then took an unfortunate decision to eliminate Sicelo Dhlomo."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a>Today you tell us that neither Mr Tshabalala nor Mr Zungu were party to that decision, is that not a complete contradiction, that's not a generality, do you agree with me?  How do you reconcile those two statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> If my memory serves me well, when Dube tendered his evidence he told you that he took this decision alone.  He did say that to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> But here Mr Dube puts in a sworn statement saying he didn't take it alone, he took it with the other three as well, including Mr Zungu and Mr Tshabalala.  My question is, how can that be described as a generality?  Please tell me how do you reconcile the contradiction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> The way you look at this thing you see contradiction but that's not how I perceive it.  And if I attempt to explain in another way, it's fatal.  But he did say that the reason why he said, he wrote this way is that the command decision is the unit decision.  There's no democracy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a>	When he has taken a decision that is a decision for the unit.  He did say that, he tendered that evidence to that effect to you yesterday and told you that we were together, the two of us, when this decision was taken.  That I did mention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do I understand though that you abide by your application for amnesty in which, when you were asked to deal with such things as justifications, you keep saying refer to the commander's statement?  That is the statement that he made which you say you were shown a copy of.  That is what your application for amnesty is based on, do you realise that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you still say that it is based on what is contained in that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Yes, I adhere to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Do you think that execution was the only option available to you or Mr Dube at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That was the option we had, only option rather.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now during the period between the 24th of January and the beginning of October, had anyone of your cell members other than Mr Dhlomo been arrested or detained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Referring to which period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> October '87 to January '88.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't remember anything in relation to detention or arrest of any other cell members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well you hadn't been arrested, although you walked around with a Makarov pistol in your belt all the time, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I never was arrested in possession of a firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you arrested at all, were you taken in for questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I explained that I was arrested in '98, 6 November and I was released June '87.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  You're being asked about October '87 to January '88.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> No, I never was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was your house searched?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't remember any of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were living at home then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I was not living at home then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where were you living?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I had my places where I used to live.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you in different places all the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I had different places, I never used one place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it would be very difficult to find you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That's what I'm saying, those are my words.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So how could the deceased have come and reported to you if you weren't at home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I did say that he came to one of my harbouring places and got the message.  That's what I said yesterday if I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did he come to one of your harbouring places and get the message?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> First, he knew that it was not easy to get hold of me at home, so in this one particular harbouring place he came and I still had communication with him from that base.  That's where I left a message that anyone who will come looking for me I would be somewhere or at home.  And they also knew that they were not entitled to furnish any kind of information to just any person, only specific people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you now say he was looking for you and he went to one of your harbouring places and got a message to find you at home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I think that's what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When was that, Mr Makhubu, was that during the period the deceased had disappeared?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That happened in the morning on the 24th of January before he came to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh so you already ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Please activate your microphone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before he came to you that morning he already had information that you were to be found at  your home on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That's exactly what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now taking into account that on your version there had been no communication between the deceased and the cell for a considerable period, what information could he have given to the police that you were so worried about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> There's so  much he could have furnished to the police.  And at that time to capture an MK soldier was valuable.  So he had so much he could have disclosed to the police and in also in relation to the units as well.  He could have furnished so much to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> But he could also have given the police your home telephone number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> The police had my telephone number at home that is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But on this day he could have told the police that you the Umkhonto, not only soldier but commander of the unit, would be at your home where you were, and later during the day he could have told the police that the other overall commander would also be there.  So they could have arrested all of you, couldn't they, if he had told them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I won't speak on his behalf.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I put it to you that that afternoon he hardly needed a transmitter if he had been an informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That's what you are saying, it's not me who is saying that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And taking into account that he never took part in any activity or mission with the cell, other than to locate places of hiding, if I remember you, it would have been a simple matter to just have nothing further to do with him, there was no need to execute him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> What were we supposed to do according to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Have no more contact with him, tell him to leave the cell.  You had no evidence that he had informed on the cell, nothing had happened despite the presence of this supposed transmitter still nothing happened.  I'm putting it to you that even if you believed he was an informer, execution was hardly necessary in those circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> As you say.  That is your opinion.  I was in a fight then and you were not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I would suggest something rather different, that from what we are now told by Mr Dube, on that afternoon without him having been put under any pressure in any way he told Mr Dube that he had been turned by the police and had operated with them.  That is what we have heard in evidence, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That I heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would it not have been extremely important for the underground activities, activists, to find out from him as much as he could tell them about the police actions with informers, whether he had met any other informers, whether he knew who the handlers were and information of that nature?  Because it appeared from what Mr Dube said, that he was now prepared to disclose things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I hear all what you say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well didn't you think it was important to find out what he'd told them about you, what names he had given to the police, matters of that kind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> If it was today, I think this is what I could do but then it's a different time, it was a different situation altogether.  An informer then meant something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, because what amazes me, and the more I hear the more difficult I find it to accept it, is that Mr Dube who is the overall commander of numerous cells gets told by this man that he is an informer, doesn't try to find out what he has told the police, kills him but then goes on carrying on his activities for another six months or so before he leaves the country to go to Lusaka.  It just doesn't make sense to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Maybe Dube could be able to inject some sense in that, not me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well what about you, this was a member of your cell?  Surely it was important to you to know so you should break up your cell, form new cells, whether the police knew about your cells, would watch you?  Wasn't that important to you to know?  Are you not prepared to answer that question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't know how to answer this question because you're telling me it was of great importance to this and that, at the end none of that happened.  This is why I am quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> None of it happened, you made no attempt to find out what this alleged informer had told the police, what they knew about you, whether you were in danger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I did say that we did not ask any of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You did not want to ask any of that, Mr Makhubu, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> What I explained, and I will again explain, is that the last time we met was that we'll sit down and talk to him, but the whole thing changed altogether that day, we decided the way we decided.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> If you sincerely - if you really had a suspicion that Sicelo was an informer, were you not concerned that one of the things he would have told the police was your telephone number?  And when you phoned Sipho and Precious, were you not concerned that perhaps the police would have been listening in to the conversation and they would know what you were planning and where you were going to be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> If my memory serves me well I did not say I called to discuss with them on the phone as to what we were going to do, the details, but what I said is I called and I told them to remain, to be alert, on standby.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Ja, the police - that is exactly what the police would have been listening in to.  I mean if they were listening in they would have heard that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> No, I don't know how to answer you now because I'm not a police force member and I don't know if they were monitoring my house phone or not, so I'm not is a position to explain further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Yes, but didn't the police normally intercept telephones of the activists in those days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Anywhere a phone would be used whether intercepted or not, but you'll still continue using the phone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you.  Thank you, Mr Richard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> After the shooting where did you live?</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I had my places where I lived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you continue however periodically going to your home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Yes, I periodically went home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And where did Sipho live?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> He also had his own place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> But is it not correct he also continued going to his own home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I never said a person would not at all visit their respective places.  You would have your own ways and means to show at your house.  I did not completely disappear from home so that they did not even once see me subsequently, I used to show up at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was your home ever raided?</p>

<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What did you do with the firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't know what you mean because that was my weapon and I kept it with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> After the shooting, did you pick up the spent cartridge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Where is the weapon today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That was confiscated at a certain raid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> During late 1988.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Where was this raid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> In Emdeni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> After the deceased was shot, what ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry, Mr Richard, just to get more detail on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>	Whose house was raided at Emdeni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't know the address, but it was one place we used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> After the deceased was shot, what was the position of his body?  In what position did you leave him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't understand what you mean, the position of his body after he was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was he lying on his face or on his back or on his side, still sitting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I won't be able to remember such details, but after I shot him because he was sitting on the stone I shot him and he fell on the ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did he fall on his face or his back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> On his face.  Excuse me?  Yes, on his face, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> We have heard that you had no direct knowledge that the deceased was an informer, do you still think he was an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't want to answer that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Because I put it to you that the story is in fact far simpler than anything that we've heard.  If you refer to page 63 of the bundle, there is a report which is substantially correct, that on the 20th of January, that's five days before the shooting, four days before the shooting, the deceased was detained at the offices of the Detainees Parents Support Committee, not assaulted, taken down to John Vorster Square and signed a statement.  In a sworn statement I'm reading he said that he had been invited - in that statement he declares that he implicated the makers of this television programme as forcing him to say what he did say.  And there's various version of this.  Isn't it that it was as a result of that arrest that you and your commander for whatever reason decided to label him as an informer, quite incorrectly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> My reasons are not based on what you have said, I told you about things that happened before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Isn't it significant to you that within a few weeks of that television programme, "Children of Apartheid" being broadcast the deceased died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't understand when you say is it not significant to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now tell me, there is evidence that shortly before his departure for Soweto that Saturday the deceased had over R1 000 in his pocket, do you know what happened to the money that was on the deceased's person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did anyone remove the money from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I have no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR RICHARD</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a>	When you made your application for amnesty I take it that you knew that you were to make full disclosure for you to get amnesty, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> What I know is that I have to disclose everything with regards to the application that I've submitted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes.  Now in your application why did you not disclose that you shot and killed Sicelo?  When I say "you" I refer to you as an individual.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> When you say myself I don't understand, please repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I'm saying when you made your application why did you not disclose that you shot and killed the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I'm not sure if I never at all mentioned that because I only submitted an amnesty application.  As to whether I wrote that or not I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Let me remind you.  In your application you were asked at paragraph 9(a).4 to give the nature and particulars of the murder.  You say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a>"A person was shot with a Makarov pistol."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Is that what I've written?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Didn't I say it's me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> No, you did not,  you say he was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> But I've already said anyway, I've mentioned it now in my evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, I understand that Sir, but my question is why did you not say at the time you were making the application, that you shot and killed Sicelo Dhlomo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I have no answer to your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you see it's complicated further I think because you refer from time to time to Dube's statement which we have heard a lot of, and in Dube's statement he doesn't say who shot him either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> As I said I don't have an answer to that question as I am also talking about my application.  I don't see any problem even though it does not appear on my application, but I have admitted now and I have said it in my evidence-in-chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Do I understand your evidence to say that Sipho and Sibongiseni did nothing in the killing of Sicelo Dhlomo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> Briefly, they did not participate physically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And they did not participate even orally, is that so?  Because at the time they arrived you had already discussed the matter and made a decision that you are going to kill this gentleman and they only witnessed you killing him, is that a true reflection of what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> That's not necessarily a picture that I want you to have, but that's exactly how it happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Yes, but did Sipho and Sibongiseni do or say anything to associate themselves with the killing of Sicelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> I don't understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did any one of the two, that is the two Sipho and Sibongiseni, say they agreed that what you were doing was right, to kill Sicelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> When we explained to them afterwards they did not object.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did they say you did a good thing to kill Sicelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKHUBU:</span> It's difficult for me to relay exactly what they said or the words they uttered, but what I know is they did not object to this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Nothing in re-examination.</p>

<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> He was called Clive Makhubu.  Maybe I should explain that there were two commanders, one I can refer to as an immediate commander who is Clive Makhubu and then the other one was Pat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now Pat, would Pat be the first applicant, Mr Dube who had appeared before this Honourable Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now what was your involvement in the killing of Sicelo?  Are you involved in any way with that killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> There is not much that I did except that I was present when he was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now his killing in your mind, do you associate it with a political motive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> In what way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> After he had been killed it was explained to me why he had been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So when you say you associate it with a political motive, that is only based on what you were told by, I think it was Mr Dube?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, that's what I'm saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now you come before this Honourable Committee to ask for amnesty for your involvement in that killing, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That is correct, I'm asking amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Other than seeking amnesty, would you like to take this opportunity to say anything for the benefit of this Committee or anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Please repeat that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Is there anything that you wish to say, other than what you have said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I must say that as I am seeking amnesty I feel bad with regards to the families of ...(indistinct) Dhlomo and their friends and relatives, that they should lose a member of their family because of an act of which I was part.  That is why I feel that I should seek amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Chairperson that will be all for now on our side, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KOOPEDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Just one question.  You said you were a member of certain organisations, you didn't mention them.  What organisations were these of which you were a member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I was a member of the Soweto Students Congress.  I was also a member of the ANC underground structures.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a>	Now you described yourself as a friend and comrade of the deceased, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> For how long had you known him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> If I'm not mistaken I think I knew him as from 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And his family describe his relationship with you as close, in fact you were the best of friends.  Do you agree with that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And in fact you were a regular visitor at the Dhlomo Njele household.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> In fact the Dhlomo family treated you as a member of their family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And - so when you say you were a member of Sosco, that's the Soweto Students Congress, one of your colleagues at that organisation was the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now what happened in May 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> A lot happened, but briefly, there was a war, some of us were attacked by a group we referred to as amazinzimo at that time.  Sicelo's home was burnt down when they were attacked by those people.  My home was also attacked and the house was burnt down, and they also killed my brother.  A lot of other people were injured on that attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Indeed during May that year for those reasons, the deceased left home and looked for a safe place to live.  Do you recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, like everybody else at that time.  He was not the only one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And then in June that year, do you remember his detentions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> After his detention, did he discuss it with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I don't remember quite well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did he tell you that he had been tortured and assaulted and in detention, that he'd been under pressure to become an informer, but he refused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I think it happened because that happened to everyone, all of us were being detained at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And the experience he relates wasn't unusual?</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, that was part of our lifestyle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Then do you recall him being prosecuted for an attempted murder of a teacher?</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What happened in that prosecution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> There was a trial and they were prosecuted and they received a suspended sentence and were told to disassociate themselves with what they'd been prosecuted for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> My instructions, to speed it up, were that he was acquitted of the attempted murder charge but then sometime later he was charged with possession of a firearm,  ...(indistinct) convicted and given a five year sentence.  Were you aware of those incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I cannot remember everything because people were arrested and detained all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Very well.  Do you know what the DPS is, Detainees Parents Support Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I do, it's the Detainees Parents Support Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you ever go to their offices?</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> For what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> As the name suggests, as a person who had been detained a number of times I would go there in that capacity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And were you aware that the late Sicelo Dhlomo worked there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I know that he used to do volunteer work there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you get involved in their work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Then were you aware of the deceased's activities in making a television documentary called: "Children under Apartheid"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> While he was making it did he discuss his activities with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I don't know whether he did, but it was something that we knew about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't know if you're not placing too much value on the word "discuss".  I don't think counsel means that you had formal discussions about them, what he means is that did you as friends talk about these things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, he did talk about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And he discussed the radio interviews he was doing with Dutch television and the British Broadcasting Corporation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> He did not go into the details, but I did see the video cassettes after some time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you watch the video cassettes on a television set, on a VCR?</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I do not remember whether I saw it on TV, but I had the video cassette.   I had one for myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So the deceased's activities in this regard were widely known and very public amongst his circle of friends?</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I can say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when your legal representative asked you the question when did you recruit the deceased, you stated very quickly and very certainly August/September 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That is what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So when people put it earlier in the year you think their memory is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I would not dispute it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> But you're certain that it was as late as potentially September in the year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, that's what I'm saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now what motivated you to recruit the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Firstly, the deceased was my friend, a person that I knew I could trust and I knew that he could maintain secrecy, and that he had maintained a high level in the political arena.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And in fact from your point of view he was a desirable and valuable person to recruit, public figure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Not because he was a public figure, but I felt that he could fit into that category of desirable people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What did you tell the first applicant, Mr Dube about the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Are you - what ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> At the time that you proposed that he join the cell, what did you tell Mr Dube?</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Let me put it this way.  I contacted the commander, Clive Makhubu and I recommended Sicelo.  I did not speak to Dube.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What did you tell Clive Makhubu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I told him that as I had been requested to find somebody with whom we could work, I had identified Sicelo Dhlomo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now can you explain what the reporting obligations for cell members was to each other and to their immediate commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Are you referring to the report I had to make after I recruited Sicelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What were ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What were the members of a cell required to do regarding reporting of their activities and their plans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I do not know if I get your question clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Have you been present over the last two days?  You've heard evidence that cell members were required to report their activities, could you explain your version of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I must say that some of these activities were simple and obvious, but there were time when you had to report about activities which were not so simple.  For example, if I were to visit a relative in Daveyton and I would be absent for a while, there would be a need for me to report to the commander that I have to go visit my relatives.  I think that is how I can respond to your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you do this personally from the very beginning of your membership of the cell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> What are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When you joined the cell, you personally, did you immediately start reporting to your commander, that's Clive, if you went to Daveyton to visit a relative or any such activity? - from the very beginning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Those were some of the rules and principles which had been given to me, and I followed them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what you said, Mr Tshabalala, and I can understand it, is you said if you were going to go and visit a relative for some time, that is if you were going to be away for some time you reported the fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> But you also say some of the activities were quite simple and obvious, can you explain what you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I'm trying to explain that as Clive Makhubu was a commander and he was mostly aware of the activities of the student movement of that time, some of the things that were happening, or that we did, were obvious to him, some things that may not have been so obvious to a person who was not aware of the situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> So if one got involved in those things which you say were obvious to Mr Makhubu, he would not have to give a report to him because he knew about them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Should one understand you to say that it was not always required that one should give reports every now and then as to where he goes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> ...(no English interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Okay, let's leave it, maybe it's too simple.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what you were saying weren't you is that you were a student activist, as was the deceased, and you carried on these activities.  And a lot of them were very well-known, and the students were holding protest meetings, everybody knew about it?  So there was no need to report things like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> What I said was some things were obvious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you didn't have to tell him what you were doing in the line of student activities, but some things he didn't know about you would tell him about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> My problem with the question is that it is too broad.  If maybe you were referring yourself to a specific activity and date and enquire on that activity, maybe I could have a better response to the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What I mean is you were all, as I understand it, active people and you didn't rush along telling your commander every single thing you were doing, he knew that you were a student activist and you were taking part in these activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a>	And you personally knew in any case that the deceased would regularly go into the city centre into Johannesburg from Soweto to do his DPSC activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> What time are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> The DPSC had its offices here in Johannesburg, the deceased would go there on a regular basis as a voluntary worker and do whatever a voluntary worker does, and you knew that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And you also knew that he went there very often.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I knew about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And it certainly would not be expected of anyone, particularly the deceased, to report to anyone when he was going to the DPSC or not, it was part of his normal activities at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Please repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was it not completely normal and ordinary for the deceased to go into Johannesburg on a very regular basis and work at the offices of the DPSC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And you personally knew that he did that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, that's what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And there was no expectation that he would have to report his trips to the DPSC to either you or anyone else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> There was no need to report to me, Sipho Tshabalala because I knew about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Or to Clive Makhubu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I haven't said so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I'm asking whether that's so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> There might be a need with regards to Clive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You were there at the time, was there a need at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I think there might have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Didn't it depend on how long he was going to be away for?  If he was just going in in the morning to do his work and coming back in the afternoon, there was no need to report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I must mention that Sicelo did not come home every evening.  What makes it difficult for me is that I am not aware, I do not know what period you are referring to as of this moment.  I can give better responses if I'm referred a specific time frame.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> On your evidence the deceased joined no earlier, and I'm asking you to confirm that, than August 1987 and no later than September 1987.  Now during that period August/September/October, that's the period we're talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And if I understand your evidence, you were perfectly aware that on a very regular basis the deceased would go into Johannesburg and not come back that night and would stay with people in Johannesburg -he was your friend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I knew about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you know the names of telephone numbers or addresses of houses that he stayed in Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you have any telephone numbers where you could contact him in Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Except for the DPSC I did not have any others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you know the name Joe Kawela?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Joe who?  I do not know whether you're referring to the same Joe, but I do know a certain person called Joe, because I do not know his surname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did he work at the DPSC office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> That is the same Joe.  Now, is it correct that the accused was arrested on the 12th of October? - the deceased, I beg your pardon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I know that he had been arrested in October 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> '87.  What do you know about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That he had been arrested and released on the same day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Where do you say he was arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> If I'm not mistaken he was arrested in Zola.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> In Zola?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Is that near, on the way between home and school?  Between his home and school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I cannot say that with certainty because the house in which they were arrested is far from the way that they would normally take to school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> How did you learn about this arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> The people that he had been arrested with explained and he also mentioned later on that he had been arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What did he say happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What did he say happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> He did not get into details, but as a person who had also been detained it was apparent, it was obvious that he experienced the same treatment that everybody else did when they were arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now you say "they", "the house they", who is the "they" that you speak of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Those are the people I can refer to as members of the Sosco leadership at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Do you remember their names? - you were a member of Sosco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> One of them is Pax, another is Libelo, there may be Vusi as well.  Those are just some of the names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now according to my instructions, what he reported, that on that date, 12 October 1987 he was detained on his way to school, those who detained him requested him to be an informer and offered him money, support and that his family would be better off.  Would you contradict that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I cannot dispute it because I was not arrested with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry Mr Richard, let's put it this way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a>	Is that one of things he told you when he reported that he had been detained and what had happened to him?  Did he tell you that his interrogators had tried to recruit him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> He said he had been interrogated, but he did not explain the details of what had been said to him or what he'd been questioned on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would that have been purely normal practice that the police tried to do these things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, they normally did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They normally tried to get you to be an informer, told you that it would be much better for you, they would look after you and all that sort of thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now did Mr Dhlomo report to you that he was kicked and assaulted and that he was released the same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I did say that he did not go into details, but if a person tells you that he had been interrogated you would understand what he meant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now we know when the arrest happened, but when did Mr Dhlomo tell you about the arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It's obvious that he told me after he'd been released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> One day afterwards, one week afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I cannot remember, but we did not see each other on the very same day that he was released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So was it some days later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It's possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now at that stage, and as a result of that arrest, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry, can I just interpose for a minute?</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a>	Where was this place he was telling you all this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> We were at one of my hide-outs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> And where was that hide-out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It's difficult for me to remember because there were several, but I think it was at Emdeni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did he come to see you there at this hide-out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I cannot remember how it happened because we used to meet in various ways.  Sometimes I would go to his home, sometimes he would come to my home or to my hide-out, but it is difficult to remember clearly how or what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a>	Now after that arrest, according the deceased's mother, Sylvia Dhlomo Njeli, she made contact with the firm Ishmail Ayob and Associates and requested assistance in finding somewhere for the deceased to stay as it was no longer safe for him to be in Soweto even though he was not at that stage staying at home on a regular basis.  Did you receive any sort of intimation from the deceased, you were his close friend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I cannot remember clearly, but I had my own hide-outs which I could share with him and he also had his own hide-outs as an activist at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And some of his hide-outs were in the city centre, in and around Johannesburg, in the suburbs, not in Soweto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I cannot confirm or say that with certainty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now at this stage, on your version of the date of his recruitment he had been a member of the cell for some two and a half months, which was not for long, August, September and 12 days, 14 days of October.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I will not commit myself to that time period, two and a half months, but at that time he was already a member of the cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Had he been trained at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> How much training had he received?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It is difficult to remember because that training does not resemble the training you receive at school where it is specified what you do on this day and that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Yes, but were you there when he was receiving training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I would sometimes - I think I was present at all times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> At any stage during this period did you receive a report that he'd been arrested in possession of a handgun and a handgrenade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I knew about it.  Please repeat the question, I may have responded to something ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> In and during the period October 1987, did you receive any reports that the deceased had been arrested while in possession of a firearm and a handgrenade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I don't think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So the Sosco people certainly made no such report, the people that he was arrested with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Please repeat that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You used the word "they", "they" were other Sosco people and none of them made such a report that you are aware of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Are you referring to the incident when Sicelo was arrested with a Makarov pistol and a handgrenade?  Are you asking then that, did anybody inform me about that, amongst the people that he was arrested with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You've answered a question that during October 1987 you didn't receive any reports of that nature, that he was arrested with a pistol and a handgrenade.   You said no, you didn't, if I understood you correctly.  Was there any other such report at any time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I think it was at the beginning of the year that we got such a report, in fact I think it was after he had been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> From where did you get that report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> From comrade Pat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> But you received that report after he had been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, that's what I'm saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So that means you can tell us nothing at all about Mr Dube's allegations that the deceased was arrested in October at Khotso House, with a gun and a grenade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I think we are making a mistake somewhere here.  Sicelo was arrested in October together with other Sosco leaders at the time.  Sicelo was also arrested at the beginning of the year.  This was in the media.  It was also reported that he had been released a few hours later.  What I am saying is that I only heard that in that January 1988 arrest he had been arrested in possession of a pistol and a handgrenade.  I only learnt of it after his death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I'm dealing with October 1987, I'm not dealing with January '88.  I will come to the 20th of January 1988.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a>	From what you say, and please correct me if I'm wrong, the arrest in October '87 was with a number of other Sosco members ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He has said that, he has told us all about it.  Why do you have to repeat, repeat, repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Because on the 20th of January 1987, '88, it is correct that the deceased was arrested at Khotso House in the presence of other DPSC members, who will say there were no firearms at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> There's nothing wrong with them explaining that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And the only intimation you have that on that arrest that firearms were involved, comes from the first applicant, Mr Dube.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That is what I'm saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And in fact you have no idea of how Mr Dube got that information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, I do not know.  You are referring to the information that he was arrested in possession of these firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Correct.  And that when Mr Dube talks of an arrest in October '87, with firearms, he's mistaken, he's muddled the two arrests.  Is that not what appears to be the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now prior to October 1987, did Mr Dube or anyone else express or raise any concerns with you regarding the deceased's behaviour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Prior to October 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was there any reason why anyone might have had any concerns about the deceased's behaviour before October 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now we know that after the 12 October 1987 arrest, the deceased made the decision to leave Soweto and live away, and it seems to be at that stage he was reported missing by the cell.  Were you aware that he was missing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I'm sorry, I was distracted, what was your answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> He said yes, he was aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You were aware of it, thank you.  Now were you aware of it after the deceased reported to you about the 12 October detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> What are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> The deceased reported to you some days after the 12 of October 1987 what had happened, then you say you are aware that he apparently went missing.  When did you become aware of him being missing after he reported to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I do not remember just how long thereafter it was, but it was a while.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now the evidence is that you received instructions to locate the deceased, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What efforts did you make to locate him after October 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I went to his home.  I also went to Zola, as well as Orlando West.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And if Mr Dhlomo says you never went to the Dhlomo household during that period, what would you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I would not dispute it because it is not easy to remember everything as it happened, but I do remember that when Sicelo disappeared I did go to his home.  I may not remember the specific dates when I did this, but I did go and I did not find him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Do you remember who you spoke to, if you spoke to anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you speak to anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now what other efforts did you make?</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Do you mean ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You went to the Dhlomo household, you went to some other places in Soweto, what other efforts did you make?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I mentioned three places, the Dhlomo household and I went to Zola, two houses in Zola and I also went to Orlando West, I actually visited one house at Orlando West.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you go to the DPSC offices or phone the DPSC offices?</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I just telephoned the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Because the DPSC offices will say you went there and you were seen with the deceased during that period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I would not dispute that because I should think they keep records of who goes in and out of the offices, but it is not easy for me to remember, but I do think that I made that phone call, trying to locate Sicelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And you went there and you saw the deceased on a number of occasions during that critical period when he's said to have been missing.  You were seen with him, do you admit or deny it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I will not dispute what, agree with it.  I think you are trying to remind me of something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I'm doing more than trying to remind you, I'm putting a proposition which you have to either say yes or no to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It is not easy to deny or agree with what you are saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry, sorry for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a>	Mr Tshabalala, is there any reason why you would not have gone to the DPSC offices to look for Sicelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I don't know.  Do you mean was there a reason that could have prevented me from going to the offices to look for Sicelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Yes, if you were looking for him and you knew that he was working at the DPSC, is there any reason why you  wouldn't have gone there to look for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Do you mean was there a reason why I did not go there instead of phoning?  I felt it was better to phone.  That is what I remember doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> I'm trying to understand your response to the questions that are being put to you by counsel for the family.  Would I be correct to understand you to say that you might have gone there, but you cannot remember?  You're not disputing those who say they saw you there and you were with the deceased?  I'm trying to understand your response.</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> What I'm saying is, what I remember doing in locating Sicelo is what I have just explained as well as phoning the DPSC.  If you say there are people from DPSC who will say they saw me with Sicelo at that time, I will not disagree or agree with it.  With regards to the question if there was a reason why I would not go to the office at that time, my response is I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a>	I must say that the situation that prevails now is different from the one that prevailed at the time.  It is difficult to remember everything that happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  Now your answer then, and I can only work it out this way, is that you don't remember or are choosing not to tell us, which is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> ...(no English interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Did the witness say that he choose not to tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Why do you choose not to tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> That's not what the witness said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> That is not what the witness said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I beg your pardon, what was the witness' answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> He said he does not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> He does not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's not quite what he said is it?  As I recollect what he said is: "What I remember is that I telephoned there.  However, if people say they saw me there, I can neither agree or disagree."  He ...(indistinct) to say he remembers telephoning ...(intervention)</p>

<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He purports to say he remembers telephoning there, but he says: "it's a long time ago and if other people say they saw me there, well ..."</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Very well.  When you telephoned, what did you do, did you get through to somebody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It is obvious that I did speak to someone and that person said Sicelo was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you leave a message?</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I asked them that if they see him he should get into contact with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> How often did you telephone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> There is a noise in my headset.</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> How often did you telephone the DPSC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was it more than once?</p>

<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did the deceased contact you in response to your messages?</p>

<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now we turn to your amnesty application which is at page 13 of the bundle, and in that bundle on a number of occasions you say</p>

<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a>What do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Are you trying to get me to explain what I meant by the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I was trying to say that: please refer to the statement made by Pat, on answering this particular question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now if you go to page 10 of the bundle, and there is a three page statement, is that the statement that you're referring to?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I beg your pardon, I heard you say "no", was that your answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, that's what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Then what statement are you referring to you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You're referring to paragraph (b) as at page 6?  Now when you took the oath to your application, did you intend to imply that those three points listed in paragraph (b) at page 6 are correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> The problem I have with your question is that you are very broad.  What I was trying to say here was that you should refer to the statement because I had seen it when it was submitted, and in this statement Silver is explaining, giving reasons why this took place.  And because I only learnt of the reasons after the incidents had occurred that is why I put that statement in my application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you made your statement were you assisted in making it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you shown the commander's application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I'd seen it before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who showed it to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I requested from him that he should show it to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And he did so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And it's after you'd seen him you filled in yours?  You filled in yours after you'd seen his application?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you agree with his statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I would say so.  I don't know whether you want me to explain further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Mr Richard, which part of the statement by Silver do you want to draw his attention to?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He doesn't say the statement, he says he agreed with his application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> No, I'm referring to Mr Richard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Well the witness in answer to my question, if I heard the answer correctly, referred us to paragraph 10(b) which appears at page 6 of the bundle.  There he refers to a statement</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a>"I discovered that he was a police informer working with the MK cells I commanded."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a>That's what Mr Dube says, but that's the paragraph that I understand the witness to be referring us to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This was all what Mr Dube had told you after the deceased had been shot, was it, that these had been the reasons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now in the paragraph that you refer us to, it also says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a>"Please find attached copy behind this amnesty form."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a>Was the document headed:</p>

<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when you made your application for amnesty, did you believe that you were supporting and corroborating what Dube said in his application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When you put in your application and signed the form before a Commissioner of Oaths, did you or did you not believe that you were corroborating and supporting Mr Dube's application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I was explaining that with regards tot he statement in paragraph B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now were you present when Clive Makhubu gave evidence this morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Do you agree or disagree that at some point that evening he came to your house and said "come with me", and didn't explain.  You heard the evidence, do you agree with what he said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, he had telephoned before that I should wait for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When he came to your house did he explain where you were going or why you were going?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, he did not explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When was it that you first became aware that the deceased, your friend was about to be executed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I did not have knowledge thereof, I just saw it when it happened.  I did not have prior information that he was going to be killed.  I only got the explanation thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So that meant that until the previous applicant pulled out his weapon and shot your friend, you didn't know what was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> What do you when you say "what was happening"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You say that you had no knowledge that Sicelo was about to be executed.  And then, I'm extending it one step further, you became aware when you saw Clive Makhubu shoot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I saw that happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you simply watch the execution or did you try and stop it or ask for an explanation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It happened quickly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What was the effect on you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I was shocked and disappointed, but I was certain that I would get an explanation about what was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Who gave you the explanation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It was Pat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What was his explanation, what did he explain to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> He explained that he had a problem with Sicelo.  He said he knew that he was an informer and he then gave details that Sicelo had been following him, keeping him under surveillance and he also explained that when he was arrested he had certain weapons on him and he had been released on the same day, and also that when he questioned him about these things, he admitted that indeed he was an informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When you say "weapons", what precisely did Mr Dube say?  "He had certain weapons" was what I heard you say, what weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, he did explain the kind of weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What sort of weapons did he explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> He said it was a Makarov pistol and an F1 handgrenade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And these were with him when?  What did Mr Dube say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> From the explanation that he gave I think it was immediately after his arrest, on the very same year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> In other words, his arrest during 1987? - '88?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now during that discussion with Mr Dube, what were you told to do in the future, if anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, we were told.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What were you told from thereon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It was said we should keep this amongst  us and not divulge it to anyone else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And were you told what might happen to you if you did divulge it to other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What did you think would happen if you broke silence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Obviously I would have been arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> By whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> The people who used to arrest everyone else at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> If you broke silence and told other ANC members in Emdeni that you just seen Mr Dube execute your best friend, what do you think would have happened to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That did not occur to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Think back on those times, if you had broken silence as instructed by Mr Dube, by confiding to the ANC structures in defiance of his direction to you, what would have happened to you?  Think.  You've just seen your best friend shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That would not have happened because at that time the ANC was banned and myself and other people were members of the ANC, and I was not part or I did not take part in communications between ANC leaders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You were a member of Sosco, there were plenty of people that you could have discussed the event with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you believe Mr Dube when he told you why he had executed your friend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I accepted the explanation furnished by Mr Dube.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you believe the explanation?  In your heart of hearts, did you think he was telling you the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I accepted the explanation given by Dube although I did have certain reservations, but I did accept the explanation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Do you still believe and accept his explanations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I do believe it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now you left the scene and you ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry, sorry, just before you move away from this scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a>	Can you explain what you mean by these "reservations"?  You say although you accepted his explanation you had some reservations, what are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I was entitled to have those reservations because Sicelo was my friend.  If something happens to somebody close to you and people tell you that he or she has been doing this and that, you wouldn't want to accept it because you have feelings for that person, that person is close to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Prior to  your discussion after the execution, did you have any suspicions about your friend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Do you mean after his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I mean prior to that discussion where Mr Dube gave you a justification as to why he had just instructed Clive Makhubu to execute your friend.  In other words, earlier that month, the month before, did you have any doubts about your friend, Sicelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I did have certain reservations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I think it was in January 1988 just after the schools had opened, Sicelo had disappeared for some time and he returned.  When I enquired about his disappearance he gave me an explanation and I was not satisfied with that explanation, but I requested him to get in contact with the commander because we were worried about his disappearance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What explanation did he give you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> He said as he had disappeared for all this time he had been away consulting an Inyanga.  I think he said this Inyanga was in Meadowlands.  He just gave me an explanation about going to that Inyanga.  And when I enquired further his final words were that I may not be able to understand everything.  At that time I thought that he must be referring to his work at DPSC, but I then urged him to contact the commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> By the commander you are referring to Clive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, Clive Makhubu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now were there any further discussions between you and Mr Makhubu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> When?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> After your discussion at the time of the execution.  Did you make any plans as to what you were going to do next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> We used to see one another almost daily and we used to discuss things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What did you discuss with him about - what did you plan to do next about the death of your friend, Sicelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> We stuck to that agreement that we would not divulge this information to anybody else, it would remain amongst us, the people who had been present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now on the 28th of January 1988 you went to  see the firm of attorneys, Ismail ...(indistinct) and Partners, is that not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Why did you go there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> As a person who knew the Dhlomo family it came to our attention that the lawyers wanted to see  us or get into contact with us as we had been close to Sicelo, because the attorneys were interested in asking us some questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when Mr Makhubu was giving evidence he made a statement to the effect that there was a need to fabricate statements, were you aware of that need?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I was aware.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Why were you in need of making fictitious statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Because there was no need to divulge the truth because if we did that our lives would be in danger, moreover we had agreed that we would not discuss the matter with anybody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> But why not then not go to the lawyer at all, just leave it and say nothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Do you mean that we should have just disregarded the request made by the families of Dhlomo and Njele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> It was an option, you could have done that if you had so chosen.  Clive Makhubu while giving evidence said that while you were moving towards the place of execution you had been seen by somebody, do you remember any such thing?  ...(indistinct) company of the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When Mr Makhubu gave evidence there was a statement to the effect that the deceased had been seen in your company by others that afternoon, that evening.  What do you comment about Mr Makhubu's statement to that effect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I agree with him, he's telling the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now - so then when you look at Exhibit A, which I presume has been shown to you by now, is there anything in it that's true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> What I can say is, what is contained in the statement is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I know that there are untruths in the statement, but my question is are there elements that are true?  For instance from the police docket I know it is correct that the deceased was wearing a red T-shirt and a blackish trousers and red shoes and red socks. ...(indistinct) are there any portions of it that are true? - that's the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well if you're going to take him through it I think we'd better take the adjournment at this stage and you can do so after the adjournment.  I propose to take a shorter adjournment than normal.  We will adjourn till quarter to two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">S G TSHABALALA:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'd just like to clarify something.  I'm not sure, Mr Richard if you in fact at some stage this morning amongst all the other things, you said when this television programme was put on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> It was broadcast in December 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was broadcast in December 1987.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> ... broadcast in South Africa also, Mr Richard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Not to my knowledge in South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Unlikely it would seem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> May I proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR RICHARD:</span> (Cont)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a>	Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a>	What we were dealing with before the adjournment was that in the statement which we know is in some ways fabricated, there are some correct statements.  I had referred you to the second paragraph where it reads:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a>"He, (the deceased, Mr Dhlomo) had on a red T-shirt and a blackish trousers and red shoes and red socks."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a>Now we know that to be correct from the police docket.  Does that tally with your memory?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I do remember as to what he had on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when Mr Dhlomo wore a T-shirt, did he tuck the shirt into his trousers of did he leave it hanging out, do you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now from Mr Dube's evidence we do know that there was a man called Joe who did live in Naledi.  Why in this fabricated statement did you use the combination of Joe and Naledi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I don't remember the reasons thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now wouldn't it be dangerous to name an activist who was part of the MK and his suburb, wouldn't that be a breach of security?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It may be so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now the next thing.  We know from other sources that he was given over R1 000 on the Saturday, and here you say he had with him a diary, a radio cassette and a sum of R830, so is or is not the sum of R830 correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I think it is so because he is the one who said he had that much money with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you see the money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, I did not see the money, I did not even count it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did he say he had so much money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> He got to me during the day, it was on Sunday if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So you don't know what happened to the money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, I have no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now we do know from the police docket that he had with him a diary, a collection of telephone numbers, business cards.  How did you know that he had that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> As I said, we met during the day on that day, he came to my house.  Now I'm assuming those are things that were visible because the writing of that statement as I said, the content is not completely true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What time did he come to your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It was during the day.  I don't know what time it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And when had you seen him before that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I think I'd seen him a week or two, I don't quite remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when you say he had a radio cassette with him, that we can assume to be one of the truthful parts of this statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when you use the word "cassette", I presume you imply that it was a cassette recorder on which you could play music and record things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I think it's some device like that.  There will be something that people will have and hang it on the belt on the waist and have the headset as well.  It appeared to be something like that, what I just described.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> But you know what a cassette, walkman, or whatever they call it is.  You would know exactly what it is by looking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Then we also know from Mr Dube that one of the things that Mr Dube hangs his opinion that the deceased was an informer, was that he had a device on his side on his belt.  Was it the same thing, could it be the same thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I may not know but what I saw looked and appeared like a radio.  I would not know.  You see I'm not fully conversant with such devices.  I only saw something like a radio.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Can you give us a description of this thing?  How big was it, what colour was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I don't quite remember the colour, but it was something a little bit tiny, small rather.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> According to Mr Dube about this size, the size of the ...(indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Well it may be that size.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now did you ever see in either a working order or a broken state, the thing that Mr Dube alleges that he found on the person of the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, I'd never seen the one he found.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did he have the tape-recorder when he died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I did not search the man, and also I did not take any notice.  I only saw him in the state he was when he came to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now I then take it that the next paragraph is where you start fabricating</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a>"This meeting at this house was not arranged, it just happened."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a>That's not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And the next paragraph where you say he got ...(indistinct) and the other person who you did not know went to buy food, the cafe was not far from the house.  That part is also not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> This issue of Naledi is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And the remains of that paragraph where you say you got the food is untrue, you've answered that question as would be the next paragraph</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a>"A small walk and then we"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> As I said that issue of Naledi is not true or it's not the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now in Emgeni or somewhere thereabouts, is there a KwaNguni - I'm sorry I can't read it - Mgeni South General Dealer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> What about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> KwaMgeni General Dealer in Mgeni South?  Is there such a thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes there is a store or a shop called Mgeni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Why did you put that into the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I'd already said that what was in that statement was fabricated so it will create some picture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When we come to the issue of proportionality we have a scenario where a man, your friend the deceased, had been a member of the cell for a very short period of time and we know from other evidence that the deceased had not taken part in any operations with the cell and in fact had been out of contact with the cell for a considerable period.  In those circumstances, do you think that an execution was the only appropriate manner of dealing with the situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> This was such a long question, I lost you somewhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you agree with those circumstantial factors that are outlined which went, the deceased had been a member of the cell for a very short period of time, then he's out of contact with the cell, that's the next factor.  The next factor is he never took part in any operations with the cell, never was party to planning any operations with the cell.  Do you agree with those factors and those statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And in fact other than knowing you, his good friend, the other cell members, he really didn't know very much at all?  Yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> In those circumstances, if he had been an informer, what he could have told the police was very little more than the names of the cell members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I have no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now in those circumstances, my next question is do you think that it was appropriate to execute him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I've outlined various factors surrounding the situation as it was perceived in January 1988.  My next question is, in those circumstances if he had been an informer as Mr Dube seemed to believe, was the only manner that the situation could be dealt with, the execution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I think that necessitated a need or some explanation to be granted or to be given to the members of the cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Right, on the Saturday, I believe that would be the 23rd January 1988, were you at a meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I don't remember but a good part of my life was to attend meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now were you with the deceased at a meeting that Saturday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> No I confirm there are no further questions with my client Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a>	There is a version that I will put to you that you were with the deceased that Saturday at a meeting, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I said no, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR RICHARD</p>

<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I have just a few points I would like to clear up with you please?  You saw the deceased on the Sunday morning sometime as he came to your home, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I said during the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, sorry.  It may have been in the afternoon.  Had he told you he had the money, did he tell you what it was for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes I think he said, if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> For Baragwanath, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The money was for people at Baragwanath Hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes he had said that money was for the detainees.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now you told us you met him about two weeks before then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes that was a rough estimation, I think it could have been that much or less.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And how long before that had you met him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Quite a long time although I don't quite remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well an estimate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I think it was more than a week, I'm not sure if a month or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Between a week and a month you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes around there, between two weeks or a month or two months but it was a lengthy period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well on that, you met him on the 20th January, you met him two weeks before, that's on about the 6th January, if you met him a month before it's the 6th December or sometime in November.  Is that all correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the relationship between you was all quite normal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes it was quite normal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And when did you get this disk?  Was that the disk of the television programme he appeared in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It was a video cassette.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was a video cassette?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I don't remember as to when I got that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it of the show he was in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I think it was something like a documentary, I'm not sure if I'm using those words correctly.  It was a video cassette relating to him the way he was harassed and tortured in prison and other things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he give it to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh, where did you get it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> If I'm not mistaken I think I got it after his death.  I'm not sure, however it was sent to me by one of the people he went to school with, sending it from abroad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh.  Thank you.</p>
