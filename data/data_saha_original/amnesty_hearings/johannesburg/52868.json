The facts to which I depose are true and correct and within my personal knowledge, unless the context states otherwise.  I was born in Uitenhage in Kwanobuhle Township and grew up in the Eastern Cape.  I was born 29 years ago and unmarried.  I left school in 1989 doing 9 and left the country to Botswana the same year.  I joined PAC through Azania in 1984 and joined APLA in exile in 1989.  As APLA operative, my general instruction from APLA high command was to prosecute the armed struggle with all means against the racist minority regime which was undemocratic and oppressive.  They said the armed struggle was in essence a guerilla warfare during which we as APLA cadres had to seek and attack the bastions and minions of the then aforesaid regime.  The ultimate objective of PAC and APLA was not only to topple the then racist minority regime, but to eventually return the land to the majority of the African people.  The bastions and minions of the then erstwhile regime were in terms of the APLA perspective the member of the South African Defence Force, the members of the South African Police and reservists in general, the farmers as they belonged to commando structures over and above the fact that they occupied the farms which had to drive them away from so as to widen our territorial operation base, which was aimed at eventually consolidating, deliberated and repossessed land.  The white homes which were garrisons of apartheid.  My general instruction was to seek, identify and attack the enemy who was seen in the context of the above stated bastions and minions of the regime, and also to train other cadres and command them in whatever operation that is being embarked upon.\n\tDiepkloof Police attack.  In consequence of and in pursuit of the above stated objective, during May 1993 I commanded a unit of APLA cadres that launch and attack on a South African Police vehicle in Diepkloof which resulted in one of the policemen in the said vehicle losing his life and apparently another one was injured.  During May 1993 the South African Police, through its security forces, launched a national swoop on the offices of PAC and also arrested various members, including those who were in the national leadership position of PAC.  This act was seen as being provocative and declaration of hostilities against the PAC despite its involvement in the negotiating process, which action had to be responded to.  I then received instructions from the director of special operation who was also a deputy director of operation who had deployed myself in the area earlier in the year to counter the above stated aggression of the South African Police.\"\n\tMr Dolo, I would like in that paragraph just to tell the Committee if you know the name of this person who was the director of operation and who was also deputy director of - who was director of special operation and also deputy director of operation?  The name of the person who deployed you in the Gauteng area.",

The following day, that I think was on the 26th, I think this police sweep was on the 25th, then the following day, the 26th I have the contact with Sipho telephonically.  And he encouraged me that we have to intensify our operations in response to this aggression which was committed to the PAC.  In that same a unit, I ordered a unit under the leadership of Kenny to go out and attack the police.  But I learnt the following day that nothing crop up.\n\tThe same following day, that is on the 27th I again ordered him with the same unit to go out and attack the police station, the police, whether on their police van or whether moving on foot.  They again, out of a lot of dilly-dallyings caused by one of the operatives names Musa.  They were using Musa's car.  So, Musa was having problems.  That's the information I get from Kenny, that he was having problems with his cars.  That led my involvement now, to be practically involved in these operations, that would be on the 28th.  \n\tThen on the 28, with the information from Peter Patrick Mochundu about the movement of the police in that area of Diepkloof and Orlando it was then that we decided to attack the police in questions.

Peter, Musa and Godfrey came to my place as we agreed the previous day to go and launch this attack.  \n\tThe attack or an ambush was going to be carried out in the T-junction area of Orlando East and Diepkloof.

One 26 gram petroleum, 2 kg of plastic explosive, one block of 250 grams petroleum, one Chinese stick granite.  Initially I was not going to be involved in the Diepkloof police attack, but due to numerous delays I decided to be involved and command the operation.  The reconnaissance of the target was done and we knew of the times of the vehicle we were to attack as it was always taking policemen to and from work.  We decided to wait for it at the robots of Orlando, Diepkloof and I was armed with R4 and the other person, I have forgotten his name, was carrying an AK47.\"\nThat's Kenny, Mr Chairman.\n\"And I'm not sure about the others.  We divided ourselves into three groups.  Assault group myself, security group the person I've forgotten his name who was also a recruit (which is Kenny).  Three, warning group Peter and Godfrey.  The police van came and we executed the mission and thereafter we withdrew using Musa's vehicle who turned out to be a police informer.

I was with Kenny, the one who was also involved in the Diepkloof attack, who was also involved in Eikenhof incident.  The police came, I think it was early in the morning, very early in the morning after all.  We hear the sound or the bricks caused by Nyala, one of the police van.  We wake up and I told him that we have to fight.  Normally the guns will be positioned in the position whereby we won't be caught napping, but in this time they were behind the mattress.  That is the R4 and an AK which was in my room.\n\tWhilst I was busy searching for the guns my friend who was with me, Kenny, jump out of the window.  Then I took the R4 and whilst I was approaching the same window, I was approached or startled when I saw that there was a light directed to my face.  I pointed the firearm to that direction and when I shoot it could not.  The person who pointed that firearm I think was very shocked and perplexed because he cried, made some sound.  He didn't shoot.  After those few seconds trying to figure out what is the cause of the firearm, then he shoot me.  Then I fell inside.  I came out again trying to fight my way out.  I was shot again.  \n\tAgain on the third occasion I sort out the question of the firearm.  I find out it was locked and this time my left hand was badly caught.  I have to position the firearm in my elbow.  When I came out again on the third occasion, I think I only manage if I shoot not more than one bullet.  Then I was caught again from both of my hands.  When I fell back again I was closely to the - there was a case, I was on top of it next to the bed.  There were shots from all directions.  I was then on top of the bed, then the shot caught me on both of my legs above the knee.  Then I fell down.  \n\tThey continue shooting until at some stage whereby they thought maybe it's over, because they found out maybe they are the only ones who were shooting.  They kick off - open the door to my room.  They drag me out of the house.  I was only wearing an underwear at that stage.  Outside the house I was positioned to lie with my back.  They throw stand grenades to the adjacent house.  I think two stand grenades were thrown and out of the explosion of those stand grenades a window debris fall in my body and cause some scar.  \n\tAfter that they came to me and started their interrogation.  I was beaten up.  They were kicking at me.  Some will extinguish their cigarette butts on my face.  They will make their interrogation asking me a lot of things.  I was in pains.  I don't think I even managed to answer them.  I was in pains and I think I was crying up to an extent I lost consciousness.  I awake at the hospital.",

Throughout history people have demonstrated their rebelliousness against oppression, against exploitation forced upon them by the avaricious, the greedy and the ...(indistinct) vile systems or Governments.\n\tThe people also demonstrated their commitment to world history, a stepping stone to the emancipation of mankind under the vanguard body, that is PAC whereby they call, inter alia, for the overthrowal of the white domination.  That was the images of the APLA.  The APLA images to carry forward the people's mandate, that is of the defending of Azania, its wealth and its people.  And in that struggle the police and the army were regarded as the pillars of white domination of the settler colonialism and that distinguished them to be the prime targets of our bullets.  \n\tAnd further to that, police have been seen by the masses as the instrument for protecting their property and the political order of the haves.  So, our struggle therefore, it has nothing personally or in whatever action I was involved in it, it has nothing to do personally with the victims that we are dealing with in this matter.  It was part and parcel of the mandate to carry forward.  So personally I had no vendetta against the family or the one who passed away.  It's a pity that people have to die.  After all, death I believe it is supposed to be a universal taboo, something to be treated, but it has to be.

            "I was actually the passenger in the police van that was driven by the late Constable Jacob Mabaso.  We were conveying members who just went off duty from Meadowlands to Orlando, and on our way back we took the road that led us to the Soweto freeway which was at the intersection between Diepkloof and Orlando.\n\tJust on the intersection we were forced to stop by a robot that turned red and a couple of seconds after we stopped there actually I personally heard a sound, sort of a banging thing at the back and I tried to look out of the window, only to find - actually when I looked out of the window I saw these guys who were like firing towards our van.  I didn't know what exactly was going on, but I remember I screamed for Jacob and I just said, \"Jakes\", and I tried to pull out my firearm but I was struck by the first bullet on my shoulder, on my right shoulder and my hand went limp.  And I went down between the dashboard and the seat just in the passage into the car trying to duck the bullets that were like showering at us.  I was shot several times while lying inside the car until I lost consciousness, and I only woke up I think after the car hit the railings on the other side of the road, because we were standing in the robot and apparently when Jakes was shot he lost control of the vehicle and it was in some kind of a steep slope.  So, the vehicle went down until it hit the railings on the other side of the road.  And that's when I woke up.  \tWhen I woke up I looked at Jakes who was then sitting in the driver's seat and I tried to call him, but unfortunately my voice didn't come out and at that point in time his head went like down like this and I think he was gone.  I tried to get up and I realised that my whole body was sort of stiff, I couldn't move.  The only part of my body that I could move then was my left hand, and with my left hand I pulled the door and when I pulled the door all the glasses from the bullet that broke the glasses, all the glasses like fell on me and my whole weight went to the left side of my body and I was like - I actually fell to the ground from the car.  \tOn the ground I realised that my gun was actually in my right hand, but the trigger gun had hanged in my small finger.  That was the time when I tried to pull out my gun, it only landed up in my left finger and I couldn't move my hands, I couldn't move anything except for my left hand and I tried to scream but my voice didn't come out.  \n\tI realised that I was shot, but at the stage I didn't even know where was I hit because I had blood all over from the top of my head down to my legs.  I lied on the ground for several minutes which I can't remember how long exactly, and in a while someone came.  I didn't know who the person was.  That person came very close to me and I thought he was like one of those guys and he was just going to shoot me and kill me, because maybe he realised I was still alive.  And the person came to me.  He pulled out my right hand which had my gun in it and he took my gun and he pulled - I had on a jersey, he pulled my jersey and put the gun under my jersey and covered it.  Then he untied my boots and he pulled off my boots and untied my field dress trouser as it was like tied and he took off I think socks, if I remember well.  Then he lied me on my back on the ground.  He was talking, but I couldn't make out what he was saying because I was like almost half dead and in a while I opened my eyes and realised that there was a car standing, I think it was an ambulance because I heard the little sound of this ambulance, the sirens.  I was put into that car and that was the last time I was conscious at the scene of crime.",

Mr Chairman, the only aspect I will deal with is the question of disclosure extensively, but I want just for the purpose of the completeness of this matter.  Mr Chairman, there's no doubt that Phila Dolo was a member of APLA, and as such a member of PAC, and that at Gauteng he was not familiar with this area.  He's originally from the Eastern Cape.  He only came to Gauteng only for a specific mission and that mission was on behalf of his organisation, that is APLA, and this incident was part of his action as a member of APLA.\n\tMr Chairman, as I indicated, I don't want to waste time.  The court judgment also - normally in cases of this nature, Mr Chairman, earlier you find people denying even if they were members of political organisation, let alone of being APLA.  I know that they deny they are APLA.  Of course, one knows that everybody wants to get away with whatever he's charged of, but also it's also clear in the judgment, also even the Judge accepted that his actions in particular, because the others were acquitted, that is Peter and Godfrey, that his action with regard to this incident were political.  And also it transpired during the mitigation of sentence when the Deputy Secretary of PAC then, Carter Sliga, came and gave evidence and he also confirmed that they were members of APLA, though also the Judge said that it's clear though they were denying it.  Then it covers now that portion that they belong to a recognised political organisation, because also the court accepted that, and also the political motive it was also accepted by the court.\n\tNow, Mr Chairman, the point which is left is that whether the applicant has made full disclosure before this Committee.  Mr Chairman, it is my submission that the applicant has made full disclosure regarding his participation in these incidents.  The Diepkloof attack and the incident regarding surrounding his arrest what he did, Mr Chairman.  He forthrightly told the Committee what actually took place, even went to the extent of telling the Committee about even that there were delays, which even the Committee would not have been aware that he was not going to participate initially, would not have been aware of that.  But the way he put it, he wanted the Committee to have a fuller picture of what was happening.  He took the Committee to his confidence and told the Committee what actually took place.  And he did not lie to say that somebody else did the shooting.  He told the Committee that, \"I was in the assault group.  I'm the person who did the shooting, and I was supposed to do the shooting\".  \n\tAnd as such, Mr Chairman - and also he went further even before his arrest that, \"I was the person who was going to initiate the person because I was going to avoid arrest.  That was the reason, I wanted to get away.  I was going to shoot the police, but unfortunately my firearm jammed\".  So, he does not deny or hide any role he played in this matter, regarding the whole issue of Diepkloof and surrounding his arrest.\n\tAnd also, Mr Chairman, even his part in the Yeoville incident, that he supplied the weapons that were going to be used in the Yeoville Police Station attack.  Though I think, Mr Chairman, if I'm correct in reading the judgment, also that he was not, I don't think he was charged for that offence initially.  He was only convicted of possession of arms which were found in the house.  But he went further to tell the Committee that, \"I was also involved in that incident, because I'm the person who supplied and who gave the order that they can go and carry out the operation\".  And, Mr Chairman, as I indicated that I don't want to waste the time of this Committee regarding this part, suffice to say that I submit that the applicant have complied with the requirements of Section 20(1) and (3) and it is quite clear that he was acting on behalf of APLA, a publicly known political organisation and the liberation movement, which was engaged in the political struggle against the State at that time.  And also, Mr Chairman, that the applicant did not act for personal gain or out of personal malice or ill-will or spite directed against the deceased and the victims.  It is quite clear that he had no personal knowledge of these people and that he merely carried out the instructions, and he acted within the course and scope of his activities as a member of APLA and also as a commander of APLA.\n\tAnd on that basis, Mr Chairman, we are submitting and requesting that this Committee grant the amnesty to Phila Dolo as he applied for it.  Unless the Committee wants me to address on any point, thank you, Mr Chairman.",
