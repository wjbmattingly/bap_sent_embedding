You are dealing here with the promotion of national, of unity and reconciliation, and I submit with the greatest respect that if the rules are going to be completely restrictively applied, and it is, I submit your suggestions are making the rules extremely restrictive, I submit that maybe this will have an adverse bearing on achieving the desired reconciliation and unity, as what, that's what this Act is all for.  I submit that it should be liberally applied, not restrictively applied.  \tI submit with the greatest respect Mr Chairman that in a circumstance like this, where it is probable, and I submit that on this it's not for the applicant to show you beyond doubt that he put an application in and it got lost.

According to this affidavit, this application is allegedly to have been completed on or about the 10th of May 1997.  One would have expected an explanation as to why enquiries had not been made thereafter about, what about the position of this application.  So in your preparations, one would expect an explanation for that as well.\n\tMr Steenkamp there's been an application for this matter to be postponed to next week.  Have you got any comments on that?",

My only, with all respect Mr Chairman, the suggestion is that when considering this application the rights of the victims must be considered.  That's my only remark if I may make it.  Thank you Mr Chairman.\n\tBut regarding the position of postponing it, may we put on record I think it's a common fact that during the time of this application I don't think this specific individual in discussion was a member of the TRC.  I think that's a factual position.",
