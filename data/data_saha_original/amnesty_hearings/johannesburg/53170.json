Beki was therefore the driver of the hit squad that was operational that day.  And he also referred to incidents where Nthabazimbi tavern was attacked or a tavern at Nthabazimbi was attacked.  One of the people who were victims of the attack is confined to a wheelchair, but then importantly it was the driver of the hit squad members.

We killed ourselves, whereas there were other people who had infiltrated the black communities, 'though we are not sure whether there was third force involved or something else, but I hope now during this new dispensation people will not be used to kill their own people.  I would like to apologise to the parents of the two gentlemen where, of which I was involved in the killings.  I apologise.  I also want to apologise to the committee that is here, but I was forced to do whatever, because of the situation, and my parents also died and I don't know their killers but I knew very well that the Inkatha people have killed them.  I was forced, it's not that I was taken by anger to the Khanyile families and the others, the apology is coming from the bottom of my heart.  I hope this will never happen again, 'though I knew very well that the elections are coming because all this happened just after Chris Hani's death and just before the elections.  But I hope such things will never happen again.  I'll try to avoid such things as the former commander if I see that there are some attacks that are imminent.  If Beki's family is here I would like to apologise 'though I fail to go to their house and apologise.  I did not know what their response would be.  I want to apologise again and I hope that even the Truth Commission would forward my request to the family of Stephen and Beki.\nMy request is this, I don't know what to say at the moment, but the major thing is I would like to be granted amnesty as a person who confessed.  \n\tI know that no-one knew what happened except the members of the SDU.  No-one knew that we killed Stephen.  We used to cover up for one another and knew very well that even the Commission, the Committee and the police wouldn't know about that incident because we used to cover up for one another.

The fight started there between the Xhosas and Zulus up to a certain stage whereby the IFP and ANC then the Zulus were falling under the IFP because they were residing at the hostels and I believe that there were other Zulus who were against the IFP but for the fact that they were staying at the hostel and everyone in the hostel nationwide would be regarded as an IFP member.

That is when the people got the opportunity to use the people to kill the larger population who were to partake during the registration.  Perhaps now such things will not happen because some of the people were worried that they will lose power and they were worried that the black people were there to defend their own country and win back the power.  Because of the situation that has happened now, the situation that is brought about this new government and ANC has done a lot of things I think it's the people who were used they've got their own jobs now, they are working now, it won't be easy for violence to be used again.  I'm not sure about Tokoza but I think the registration process is on right now and even the no-go areas are no longer like that.
