<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Chairperson, my next - I'll try to call them in a sequence Mr Chairperson since two are involved in two incidents.  I'll call Zola Prince Mabala, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>	Mr Chairperson, just before he is sworn in to testify Mr Chairperson, I want to put it on record that he is the person we have been waiting for the whole of this morning.  Mr Chairperson, Mr Mabala, I've received information also myself I've consulted with him, is not well.  He's - if I may put it this way, he is suffering from memory loss, we have a problem even in communicating with him and he was in prison hospital, he's been kept in prison hospital because he can't, whatever he is saying you can't make sense from it, but he's trying if you are patient with him.  What I'm trying to, I'm calling him to confirm the affidavit.  That's why I didn't start with him though he's a commander, we are supposed to start with him concerning the affidavit of Mr Khotle.</p>
