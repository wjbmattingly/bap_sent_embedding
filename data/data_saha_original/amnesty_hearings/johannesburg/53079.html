<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Were you a member of an SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And who was your commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> That is Chris Motokwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> You are applying for amnesty for two crimes, the first on is kidnapping and the second one is possession of ammunition, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Okay.  Describe in your own words to the hearing, the kidnapping.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I don't remember the actual date of that particular incident of kidnapping.  What I remember is that it was on the day when people from the hostel were going to bury their members ...(indistinct) to Polla Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're going too quickly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> I didn't hear the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're going to fast and the interpreters have to keep up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I don't remember the actual date but it was in 1993.  It was when the hostel dwellers were going to bury on of their members.  They were coming from the hostel direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>	They started to shoot from the tennis court in Thokoza ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who shot from the tennis court, the funeral marchers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I would say those people who were shooting we were not able to identify them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, what I - shots from the general direction of the tennis courts were discharged in which direction, to whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> They were in houses next to the tennis court.  We did not agree with them that they should pass through Khumalo Street when they were going to the cemetery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who were these shots directed at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Those people who attended the funeral were those who were shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja, yes, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> After that shooting I was from Extension 5 towards Beirut.  We met Peter Sewasi.  We were three in that car.  It was myself, Siphiwe Galata and Linda Radebe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Linda Radebe.  I was driving towards Polla Park looking for AK47 ammunition because I was ordered to go and buy those ammunitions.  Linda Radebe who has since died saw Peter Sewasi, who is my co-applicant.  They asked me that my car should be used.  Peter was having a red headband like members of the IFP whom we were fighting with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>	When he was put in the car, because police were many and the soldiers.  We drove to Polla Park.  When we arrived at Polla Park we found that there was a meeting of neighbours around Polla Park.  We explained that we were afraid to take along one person who had a red band, in case the police and the soldiers saw us and seeing that person in our car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>	I was driving a Kadette 1992 model.  It was white in colour.  Registration of that car is RRS674T. ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't understand, just hold on.  This person with the red band, where did that person come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> We found him immediately after those people who were shooting dispersed.  Many things happened which he was implicated in those things around our area.  When we took that person we wanted him to explain the neighbours of Unit F.  Because there were people who disappeared, he was seen with people who were members of the hostel, who were staying in the hostel.  We wanted him to come and explain as to whether what happened to those people who were kidnapped by hostel dwellers whom he was with at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Okay, Mr Thulo, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could you kindly explain, did he get into your car voluntarily or did you grab him, how did he land in your car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> We requested him to get inside the car but he wanted to run away, then we forced him inside the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Now Mr Thulo, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what did you want him to explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> He was involved in - there were allegations that he was involved in incidents of people who were kidnapped.  Where I'm staying is near the hostel.  When there were shootings he identified with Buyafuti's hostel dwellers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>	He was again seen taking three boys who were just walking in the street around the township in Unit F.  I don't know where they came from, but unfortunately they were stabbed with assegais by residents of Bhuyafuti hostel and he was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you believed that he had associated himself with the commission of crimes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, that was my belief, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now before I interrupted you you told us that you said to certain people that you were uncomfortable with taking this person into your car because he had a red band on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, that's what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please explain that to me, I don't follow that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> When we met with Peter, we met at Sheagwe. it's near Polla Park.  When we took him inside the car we were afraid to pass through the township because the police and the soldiers were around that area.  We took him to Polla Park where I was supposed to go and buy AK47 ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>	When we arrived there we saw people assembled in a meeting.  It was near to a water tank next to Polla Park.  When I explained to the meeting, because they saw me driving faster inside, we told them that we should take that person to Unit F because we were not protected and we were afraid that the police and soldiers would see us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>	We wanted to leave him there and then we would return later when the police have left the township.  I bought what I was supposed to buy.  I left those ammunitions in Section F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Sorry, Mr Thulo, just on the point of the meeting, you say that you took Peter Sewasi to this meeting, did you leave him there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, I left him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I left him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And where did you go to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I returned to Section F, after buying the AK ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Did you have anything else to do with Peter Sewasi at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I requested that I should leave him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> I see.  Do you in fact know what happened to Peter Sewasi at that meeting after you left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> As I've already explained, I left them, I went to Unit F.  When I returned to Polla Park later I found him dead.  When I tried to find out as to what happened to him, they showed me where they burnt him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you expect to see him alive when you got there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, I expected to find him alive, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I just want to know something here now, how much ammunition did you buy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Between 1993 and 1994 I think I've bought plus-minus three thousand rounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm talking about that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I bought 250 rounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> There was a person who was selling ammunition.  His name is Uys.  We were calling each other by code names, so I did not know and I don't know his full names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know where he would have obtained these rounds?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> It was difficult to find out as to where he got them from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is this source of ammunition still available in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> No, he has since died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is one able to unlawfully buy bullets in the area still?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, we were able to buy them from Polla Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where would this - where would the distributors of this illegal ammunition, where would they get it from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> As I've already explained, we met at safe places.  I wouldn't be in a position to ask him questions about that because we were not trusting each other because there were people who were collaborating with the police and collecting information.  That is why it was not possible to ask him where he found those ammunitions from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why would people need the ammunition now, after 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Do you mean after 1994, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I never bought those ammunitions after the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I'm not saying you bought it, I'm just asking you, you told me that one is still able to buy unlawful ammunition or illegal ammunition, sorry.  Do you know why people would still want to buy ammunition in this country today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I am not able to account to that question, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you still a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you hold any office in its hierarchy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I am an ordinary member of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> And finally, Mr Thulo, did you know that it was illegal for you to possess these bullets at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SAMUELS</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Swanepoel, I don't suppose you have any questions to this witness have you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Not at this stage, thank you, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR SWANEPOEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Patel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS PATEL:</span> Thank you, Honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>	Sir, could you please tell us, you stated earlier that you were ordered to buy ammunition, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> By whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> That is Chris Motokwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> I'm sorry, could you repeat that please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Chris Motowe: M-O-T-O-W-E.  Chris Motowe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Chris Motokwe.  I beg your pardon, Chris Motokwe: M-O-T-O-K-W-E.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> And who is he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> He was the commander after I left that position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Sir, of which section would that be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> That is Unit F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Was he specific in his instructions to you in terms of purchasing of weapons, in terms of where you needed to go and what needed to be done with the weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I was given money that I should go and try to find the place where I would be able to buy that ammunition.  Fortunately we were able to trace that place in Polla Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.  What would happen to the weapons after you had purchased them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> We were near Buyafuti hostel.  In many instances our section was attacked by people who were hostel dwellers.  That is why we went to buy ammunition to defend ourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.  Would this then be distributed to the various members of your unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> You stated that Peters Sewasi was involved with the police hit squad, in your application, do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, I verify that because the police were associating themselves with hostel dwellers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> So what other information did you base this on?  Was there any specific information that Peter Sewasi himself was involved with the police hit squad or are you saying this generally because you think that police were involved with the hostel dwellers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Those people who were attacking us at all times were driven by police cars.  When people were stabbed with assegais, they were attacked in the full view of the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Were there any other incidents that you can recall that relate to Peter Sewasi, upon which you based your decision or upon which the unit had based its decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I would say I've said a mouthful by saying one member of the youth was attacked with assegais, because I'm staying near that hostel.  He was attacked in front of the police or in the presence of the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Do you ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> It was Peter Sibya at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, he was present when that person was attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Do you have any idea why this person was attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> They would ask questions about people who were not seen regularly near the hostels and they would use Zulu.  Then if you are not able to respond in Zulu, therefore you would be attacked, especially when you can tell them that you come from Beirut or Cathrada or Sesulu or other sections, you would be attacked.  You would survive if you can tell them that you come from Vosloorus or other places outside that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> So you're saying very simply that these people were attacked because they were not Zulu speaking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> That's the method which was used, that those people who were not conversant in Zulu would be attacked.  I would say that in short.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> You've mentioned the Polla Park Kangaroo Court in your application, could you briefly explain how the court operated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> As I've already explained earlier, that we found that meeting being on - maybe you would - I said a meeting, not a Kangaroo Court.  That is where we left Peter there in that meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Now if you would turn to page 268 of the bundle, at 9(b), you mention specifically the Polla Park Kangaroo Court, you didn't mention it in your testimony here today, but it is mentioned in your application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, I see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Didn't he say Ms Patel, that when he came back expecting to find this person, that he discovered that that person had been killed and he was shown where this person was burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> But he didn't mention the Kangaroo Court specifically, he just mentioned a meeting generally.  So the gist of my question is really, does this applicant know how that Kangaroo Court operated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I have no knowledge of their operations.  Maybe I included that Kangaroo Court by mistake but in that meeting, in many instances that is where they would discuss about people who were collaborating with the police and then those people would come and attack Polla Park and Beirut.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Maybe you don't know, Mr Thulo, what happened that day, but are you saying you have no knowledge what has to come to be known in these newspapers as the Kangaroo Court, you don't know how these things operate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> That is where people would be asked questions to get some light about particular issues.  That is why I - perhaps I would say they would be question then when I arrive we will be able to have information as to whether why was he, why did he associate himself with attackers of the residents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm not talking - I prefaced my question by saying I'm not talking about the events of that day, I'm talking generally, are you not aware how the people's courts operated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I don't have ..(end of tape - no recording on side B of English only tape)</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(no recording) 1984 to 1994, you have never been in a position to understand or be told how these courts work and why and how people were convicted and executed by way of being burnt, in most cases by being burnt with a tyre around them?  You never heard of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I'm not able to explain because I would not identify that kind of a meeting as a Kangaroo Court or what, but I know that it was just a general meeting so that at the end of the day they would question a person then they would make a decision and burn that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Under whose instructions did you leave Peter Sewasi at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I left Siphiwe and Linda there in that meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think he testified that he requested that he, that the deceased be left there because he wasn't comfortable with riding around with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Was it your understanding that he would be left there so that the persons present at the meeting could question him, could question Peter Sewasi on his activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> No, as I've already explained, I requested that he should remain there because the police were roaming around the township, so I was not comfortable that we'd meet the police if we could go around with him.  I did not leave any instruction that they should question him about his activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, then perhaps you could explain to us, persons who were present at the meeting, for what purpose were they gathered there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I explain that in many instances we would hold meetings to try to solve the problems in our area, about attacks and about people who were helping the police, so that they should be identified and then we should remove them from the association of the police and come to our side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Are you saying that the purpose of the meeting, parties that had gathered there, that their sole function would be to try to ensure that persons who were involved with the police would then through some kind of process with them, cease that activity and become a part of the organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I'm requesting that you should repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was the purpose of this meeting to persuade third force, for example, members to stop their activities against the community and join the community or to join a favourable political party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I believed so in short.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Patel, when you get to a convenient stage we will adjourn for tea.  We adjourn for ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>MACHINE SWITCHED OFF</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Mr Thulo, by the time of the abduction of Mr Sewasi, for how long had you been involved in the Self Defence Units, up until that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not activated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> It was about a year and six months then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> During that time, in terms of your experience, how did the community generally deal with persons who were in Mr Sewasi's position, ie: assisting police generally involved in acts of terror against your community?  How did the community generally deal with people of that kind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> The community would try to convince them so they can change and be part of the community again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> And what would happen if they refused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I did not experience that kind of an incident, as to what would happen to those people who did not want to co-operate, but in our section we were encouraging people to be rehabilitated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did you attend any meeting where they in fact convinced or persuaded a collaborator to change his views and join the movement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I don't remember attending such meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Have you heard of any person who has been named as a collaborator, who changed his point of view?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> After you had abducted Mr Sewasi, was there a conversation that took place between yourself and the other persons in the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> That thing happened in a very short space of time.  We did not have an opportunity to discuss with him because the car was seen when we put him in, by other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Was there a discussion before you had abducted him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> We requested that he should co-operate with us and go with us to that particular place, that is Unit F, then he denied, then we forced him inside the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> And what was the plan, what were you going to do with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Our intention was to get information from him because many parents lost their children and some of them disappeared to unknown places.  Within the black community if a member of the family dies, that family should be informed and therefore they should get the remains of the deceased and bury him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Who would authorise this plan, whose idea was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Because I was a driver I explained that the person whose name is Linda Radebe, identified Peter within attackers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Do you still stand by your earlier testimony that the purpose of abducting him was to try to persuade him to desist from the activities that he was involved in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, I still maintain that view.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> What was the primary objective though, was it to illicit information as to where persons who had gone missing, where they were or what had happened to them or was it to convert him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> It was that he should be rehabilitated and be accepted by the community because we lived with him in that Unit F.  We did not believe that we should take a decision on our own and ill a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> What would you have done with him if he refused to give the information regarding the persons who are missing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Our primary objective - I don't know what could have happened to tell you the truth, because we did not have an opportunity to talk with him.  I would not predict and say what would happen if he denied, but I our intention was to rehabilitate him so that he will be acceptable within the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> I ask you once again, Sir, what would you expect to have happened to him if he refused to co-operate with you?  Surely that must have been discussed, or in terms of the manner in which the organisation had operated, or the community had operated before then, there were certain expectations that you had, what were those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> In our meetings as a community, together with the commanders and members of the committee who were responsible to resolve the problems or our area, I believe that they would have an ability to persuade him to give up that information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> No, but when he refused to co-operate, what did you expect to happen to him, would you leave him just like that and say: "You are refusing to co-operate"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I would not be able to respond to that question, as to whether what could have happened if he denied because he was taken to a place where he was supposed to be.  That is where they would see what would happen if he denied or if he gave out information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Thulo, isn't it a fact that during those turbulent years, if he would have refused and he was seen as a collaborator, wouldn't you expect the community to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I did not believe that he could have been killed.  As I've explain, we did not have a right to kill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Were you surprised when they showed you where he was burnt and were you surprised that he was eventually killed and burnt, were you surprised?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, I was surprised.  I did not even have the ability to ask questions because I was afraid that something would happen to me if I ask questions about that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Was there no bad blood between ANC and such members of the Self Defence Unit and people like Peter Sewasi who was IFP aligned, were you not fighting each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> It was not war in that sense, we were in a position to defend the community against the attacks which was launched by hostel dwellers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> You were buying arms and ammunition which is illegal and if you defend yourself against such attacks, wouldn't you kill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> The Self Defence Unit was created to defend the people and then in that defence you'd be able to kill, people would die in that kind of a defence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Mr Thulo, here was a man who you'd abducted, who by your own admission had been involved in gross human rights violations against the very persons whom you had undertaken to protect, do you seriously want this Committee to believe that if he had not given his co-operation to you and your colleagues, that it was not reasonably foreseeable that he would be killed or at the very least seriously injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> We did not foresee or think about that because those things happened in a very short space of time.  That is why I had to leave and go and hand over that ammunition to my commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Let me ask you this, what was Mr Sewasi's behaviour like after you forced him into the vehicle with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> He denied to co-operate with us, that is why we forced him inside the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Given that, what made you believe that he would co-operate with you in terms of giving you the information that you required?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> If you're a person you have a conscience, then you have fear.  I would say that he would be frightened that something would happen to him.  If we were prepared to kill him we could have advised those people we left him with so that they should kill him in our absence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> The purpose of this hearing is not to ascertain whether you were guilty of a crime or not.  We're not a criminal Court, we are a body who would give amnesty to people who come forward and tell us the whole truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>	So as a matter of fact we are granting amnesty to people who would say: "I'm guilty of doing this or that or another thing", and openly talk about it so that the community can hear what happened and then if you've committed a crime and it was for political reasons, we must give you amnesty according to the Act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>	So there is no reason to be afraid to tell us the whole  truth and what in fact happened during those days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, I do understand.  I believe that what I am saying is the truth.  As I have taken an oath, I am mindful of the fact that I'm coming here for amnesty.  That is why I did not know what would happen thereafter when I've left that meeting.  If questions have been asked, I am not able to tell this Committee because I did not know what would happen thereafter or what would happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could you tell us who was in control of the meeting, who was the chairman and to whom have you handed Peter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I explained that Siphiwe and Linda, I left them in that meeting so that they would take care of Peter, together with the committee which was present or in that meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>	What happened after I had left to hand over the ammunition to Unit F, I don't have knowledge of what happened thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Is it correct that persons at that meeting were in fact waiting for you to bring Peter Sewasi there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> No, that is not the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> So this was pure coincidence, that you ended up there and left him there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you know there was a meeting there?  When you picked up Peter, did you know there was a meeting near that water tank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I did not know that there was a meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you just per chance landed up at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, that is correct, it was a coincidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you left Peter there because you were scared of riding around with him because of the presence of police and whoever else, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What would you have done with Peter had there not been a meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Our intention, we were supposed to take him to the places where he was involved in those political crimes or those crimes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, where were you going to persuade him to change his ways, if there wasn't a meeting at the water tank?  That was your reason for picking him up, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> May you please repeat your question, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The reason for your kidnapping Peter, was to ask him certain questions about the disappearance and the injuries and the deaths of certain people, as well as to persuade him to change his ways for the betterment of the community, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You didn't know that meeting was taking place at the water tank, when you picked him up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, I did not have the information about that meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where were you going to take him to persuade him to change his ways and to give information about these missing people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I've explained that we would take him to Unit F where we would meet with our commander so that we would call a meeting of the defence committee, because in many instances those were the people responsible to give us money to buy guns and ammunition after the community has contributed money to that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why didn't you just take him there instead of just leaving him in that meeting that you didn't know about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I don't know as to whether I made it clear, that on my way to meet Peter, I was going to buy ammunition.  That place was near to the place where we met Peter.  And then because of the confusion and the presence of the police and the soldiers and that there were people who saw my car and they saw me taking him inside my car, I decided to take him to Polla Park where I was going to buy the ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> You said the intention was to take him to the Defence Unit and to hand him over to the commander, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.  What would the procedure then have been after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> That defence committee was able to persuade people who associated themselves with the hostel dwellers.  There is one, I just forgot his name, he succeeded to go back home after he was involved with the hostel dwellers in the attacks of the people.  So they were able to persuade him to come back and be acceptable within our community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> And how would they persuade him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> The attempts they made was that he must disassociate himself with war talk so that he will be able to see that people who are hostel dwellers are the enemies of the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Are you saying that only verbal persuasion would be used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, the one I know, he was persuaded verbally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> And that's the only method that was used by the Defence Unit, verbal persuasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I don't remember that there was a person who was tortured or assaulted so that he should be persuaded to change his mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> When you came back and found that they had killed Peter, who did you speak to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I met Siphiwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> What exactly did he say to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> When I asked him where Peter went he said that he would show where he is.  He led to where he was murdered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> ...(inaudible) he was murdered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> He did not explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> This Siphiwe that you referred to, who exactly was he and what was his function?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> He was an operator in the Section of the Defence Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Why didn't you ask him what had happened?  Here was somebody whom you had assisted to abduct, do  you want us to believe that verbal persuasion would have been used in order to achieve the desired intentions of having abducted him, and you find him burnt to death, weren't you at the very least curious as to what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> The question I asked is, what is the reason that he was killed?  The explanation I received was that people who attended that meeting took him and then that is why it happened the way it happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Before this meeting and before you saw this body that's been burnt there, were you aware of any other people who had been killed and burnt, necklaced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I read from the papers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So were you so surprised when this happened to him?  Wasn't it often reported in the newspapers, that Councillors and people collaborating with the police were burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I said he was stabbed, I don't know of people who were burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) were you involved in the struggle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I started in 1986 when I was still at high school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How old were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I was 25 years old - I was 18 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You belonged to the youth movement, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And during that time when you were a member of the youth movement, ...(inaudible) very important part in the struggle, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And part of the strategy of the youth was to attack collaborators, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In particular black people who sold their own souls?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> May you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In particular black people who sold their own souls to apartheid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I saw it only in the newspapers, I don't remember being part of the youth group which attacked or killed collaborators.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which group were you attached to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I was a member of Thokoza Youth Congress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) the Thokoza Youth League must have been the only league who didn't do that in the whole country, would you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I would not dispute or agree that Thokoza Youth League did not attack people, but what I'm saying is that I was never part to a group of the youth congress which attacked people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Not even community councils?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> The attacks which I remember were attacks against the police with petrol bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You remember the time when our people said we are not going to vote?  Do you remember that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, I do although I don't remember the year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And during that time the youth rose to the occasion, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If I'm not mistaken that was around 1987/1998, October.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I would agree with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And despite the objections from many quarters, progressive quarters, certain people in all the locations, Indian, Coloured, African, there were people who were prepared to sell their souls, do you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And those people were dealt with, do you recall, by the youth congress?  Not only the youth congress, but the youth congress was involved in dealing with those people, do you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And do you recall what happened to those people and their properties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> What I remember is that they were beaten with batons or sjambucks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't know if you recall in the Eastern Cape, a gentlemen by the name Kenny Kini, much publicised in the whole country, do you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I don't remember him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't recall any of the community councillors being killed, even here in Gauteng which was then the Transvaal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I remember that petrol bombs were thrown to a member of the council in Daveton, that is Tom Boya.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that all that happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, I remember only the petrol bombs which were used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you never heard or read in the newspapers that somewhere in the country some of these community councillors who made themselves available for this apartheid system, they were killed, they were burnt, a tyre was put over them with petrol and set alight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> When I was reading the newspapers or listening to news I learnt that they were using petrol bombs to burn the people to death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did you ever hear the newspapers coin the phrase "Kangaroo Courts"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you not find out from your comrades what this was all about, what is this Kangaroo Court that the newspapers are referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I learnt that those people who were collaborators with the previous system were brought to that particular institution so that they would be able to be questioned about their activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I remember that people were sjambucked in the Kangaroo Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You didn't hear in these courts that the chairman would assume at times the names of appointed judges in the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, I do know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And they would conduct a trial of those people who were brought before the meeting, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, that is correct, but I've never witnessed that, I just heard about it.  I never witnessed the process of the Kangaroo Court or I never met somebody who was a member of the Kangaroo Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you know at times what happened at the end of the day when certain people were found guilty and how they were punished, they were burnt to death, isn't it, because they sold the people, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now on this day when you kidnapped Peter, you were aware of such things and that such things had occurred before, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I would not identify that meeting with a Kangaroo Court ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) Kangaroo Court.  You said you didn't know what was happening, you unexpectedly came across that gathering.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> As I've explained that people used to meet and discuss how they can avoid the attacks we suffered by members of the Thokoza community which came from many directions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>	I believed that they were discussing those kind of issues.  The explanation I gave about the Kangaroo Court, with a judge and other members of that committee, I don't know that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Ms Patel, have you got any questions left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Sorry.  This application, is this your handwriting, on page 268?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I believe so.  Somewhere is not my handwriting but somewhere is my handwriting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Okay, look at page 268, do you see paragraph (b), was that your handwriting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Yes, that is my handwriting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And there they ask you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>"State whether any person was injured, killed or suffered any damage."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>And you said:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a>"By Polla Park Kangaroo Court."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>You've written that yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Now what do you want to convey or wanted to convey at the stage when you wrote that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I explained earlier that it is because of not understanding the English language, so that I'd be able to identify a particular meeting because a Kangaroo Court in many instances was seen where many people have met or assembled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>	So it is a misuse of that word because I did not understand exactly what it meant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Mr Thulo, when you refer further - if you look at that very (b), you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>"Refer"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>and you have:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>"(Peter)"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>Wouldn't the conclusion be that when Peter was taken there, that those people who had assembled there formed a Kangaroo Court and hence his execution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> I was trying to explain where I included the name Peter to identify the victim of a person who was taken to that particular meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Mr Thulo, on page 69 you have stated that you would also like to apply for general amnesty for things that you may not recall, is that still your request?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) relevant Ms Patel, whether it's still his request, he can't get it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> My legal representative explained to me that the way the TRC Act operates does not allow a person to apply for amnesty for the things he does not know.  That is why apply for amnesty for things I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Just finally though, were you involved in so many incidents that you can't recall what you were involved in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> When I tried to explain about things which I do not remember, I was thinking of those issues, that the cameras which were used by the police during the attack, if we would go to help the community in a different manner, maybe I appear in their videos.  That is why I say those are the things which I cannot recollect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Sorry, if you would bear with me just one moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>	You've mentioned in your application, under whose approval you acted, you say:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>"Commander Chris Mdago."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>Is this the same as Chris Motokwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> Yes, that is Chris Motokwe, that is my commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Who is Chris Mdago, or is it the same person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULO:</span> It is a slip of my hand because I don't know the correct spelling but I know that he's Chris Motokwe, but the way it's written here does not correspond with the real name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Alright.  Thank you, Honourable Chairperson, I have no further questions for this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS PATEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Ms Patel, do you know whether the deceased had any relations or where he stayed, any notice given perhaps in newspapers in recent days or so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> If I may place on record, Honourable Chairperson, that ads were placed both in newspapers and on the radio some time back, for victims to come forward.  The response was very poor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>	I might add also that another ad was placed last week, to which we have had no response.  And in terms of the report from our Investigative Unit, they haven't had any luck in terms of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So as far as the Amnesty Committee or its staff could possibly have done, they've tried to get hold or give notices to everyone involved and the victims involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> That is correct, Honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUELS:</span> No re-examination.  That is the evidence for this applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
