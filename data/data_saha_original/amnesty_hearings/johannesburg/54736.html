<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman the very following one, the killingof a policeman and his wife in Hammanskraal, the same applies,it has been complied with.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Is this compliance notification to boththe victims and to all interested parties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, Members of the Committee at thismoment, and as far as the three are concerned compliance willmean notification to the victims and their legal representatives. We did not form those affected in the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But doesn't the Act require that, that'sthe point raised yesterday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman the Act requires that, but giventhe time constraints Mr Chairman that I could not do between yesterdayand today, because I had to make sure that the victims of theirlegal right and legal representation which has been done, butI did not have the time to do the rest Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Perhaps by the time we reach these applicationswe may be able to have complied with those requirements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman we may be able to do that by then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr Mpshe I did not understand you, whenwere the requirements complied with?  By complying with the requirementsI assume you mean serving them with the necessary notice, whenwas this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman this was done yesterday.  As I havealready indicated the time constraints to which I was subjected,I had to depend entirely on the Investigating</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>1A Officers/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>115</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>Officers who were doing the job right around the clock includingeven yesterday, but they informed me later while the session wason that the people that I said there was no compliance are alreadyhere and they introduced them to me.  They were present yesterday. But in the morning I was not aware thereof. They could have donethis over the weekend.  JUDGE NGOEPE:  Do you have anyindication from them what their attitude is towards the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That is so.  I spoke to the victims, or ...(indistinct)victims their attitude is opposing the applications and they havetheir legal representatives with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> In all these three instances that you havementioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> In the Hammanskraal one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> There is a legal representative present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> There is a legal representative, Mr Brian Curren. In the Nyalunga one I explained to them yesterday they said thereis none and they don't need any.  And the Committee can confirmthat as soon as they take the stand.  In the killing of Joe Tselethe same applies, the six children were here, I explained to them,and they said they don't need any legal representation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> That is number 8?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That is number 2 from the top, the killing ofJoe, it's spelt - it's supposed to read Joe Tsele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Oh I see.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> The policeman I am sorry in Hammanskraal, theyhave a legal representative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Are they satisfied that they had ampletime to prepare and consider their position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>1A MR MPSHE: /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>116</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman I did not get into that one becauseyesterday I made available copies of the relevant events to themin the afternoon as agreed between me and them and they did notindicate to me that they still need time or that they are notsatisfied.  Perhaps if they are not they will have to state itas soon as they take the stand for cross-examination purposes,but I did not ask them as to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Yes may we proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Further Mr Chairman the last thing I want tomention is that in terms of this schedule the hearings are dividedinto two, the hearing in Johannesburg as well as the hearing inPretoria.  May I just make it known to the honourable membersof the Committee that we shall not be sitting in Pretoria dueto lack of venue as indicated to me by the TRC regional office. All matters will be dealt with in Johannesburg, at this hearing. Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> In Joburg at which venue, do you have asuitable venue in Joburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman I am looking around for it all invain.  Unfortunately Mr Chairman, Members of the Committee I amnot responsible for arrangement of the venues but the logisticoffice in Joburg was responsible for this type of a venue andwhen I indicated to them that can't we have something else andthey said this is all they have, and I have to make do with whatthey've got.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Mpshe has the changed of venue been explainedto the victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yes Madam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> That is the victims who were notified thatthe hearing was going to be next week in Pretoria, have they beennotified already that it will be here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>1A MR MPSHE:/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>117</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> All of them have been notified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And do I understand you to say that youwere told, and I know it's not your responsibility, this was theonly venue available in Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Indeed so, that is the information given tome.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And that there is not a single venue availablein Pretoria, including the universities and other such places?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That is what was conveyed to me by the logisticofficer as well as the manager of the office, Mr Patrick Kelly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Pretoria seems to be overcrowded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> It seems so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Alright.  Let us proceed with the hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman I think that is all.  I will handover to my colleague.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Before we proceedMr Chairman I would just like to hand up copies of the documentsI promised which I will have available this morning.  The documentsare firstly the telephone list and then the article to which Irefer to during cross-examination.  Mr Chairman it is possiblethat reference might later be made to the telephone lists specifically. It sets out quite clearly the structure of the Northern TransvaalSecurity Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> These telephone lists will be handed in asExhibit C.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>EXHIBIT C HANDED IN - TELEPHONE LISTS</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> As the Court pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And the article in the journal will be ExhibitD.</p>

<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>EXHIBIT D HANDED IN - ARTICLE IN JOURNAL</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a> MR DU PLESSIS:   As the Court pleases.  Thank you Mr Chairman. Mr Chairman if the Committee agrees with the procedure that mylearned friend and I have agreed upon we will now go ahead withcalling Brigadier Cronje with the purpose of giving certain backgroundevidence.  The purpose of this evidence Mr Chairman would be thatI don't have to lead this kind of evidence in respect of eachof the five applicants.  Some of the evidence overlaps and I don'twant to burden the Committee with the extra evidence.  So I willonly lead Brigadier Cronje on the general background and thenI am informed by my learned friend that we will then deal withColonel Venter's application and specifically with the Pepco 3incident.  But firstly I beg leave to call Brigadier Cronje.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">BRIGADIER CRONJE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr du Plessis before you start do I understandit correctly you will not lead the evidence indicated in the scheduleas schedule 4, 6, 3, 5, 8 and 7?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You are not leading that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> No the evidence which I am now going tolead will deal with the general background which is set out inBrigadier Cronje's application and I will start on page 2 andtake it up to the first schedule, in other words page 29, thatoverlaps with some of the other applicants' evidence so it willnot deal with specific events.  My learned friend told me thathe plans in respect of Brigadier Cronje's specific evidence toadduce that right at the end.  I don't quite understand why thatshould be so but we don't</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>1A have/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>119 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>have a real problem with that procedure.  May I continue?  Thankyou.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a> Brigadier Cronje could you start on page 2 of your applicationplease.  I would like you to comment on your involvement in anypolitical party during the period that you were a security policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Chairperson I was not a member of any politicalorganisation.  I was a supporter of the National Party until 1994. Since the 1994 elections I am no longer a supporter of the NationalParty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Could you then turn to page 3.  I wouldlike you to give a short explanation of your career so that therecan be a general idea of how your career progressed. BRIG CRONJE:  I joined the South African Police on 1 January 1956, six monthstraining, afterwards transferred to uniform branch in Durban forone year, Overpoort station and then transferred to Ermelo forabout a year.  Then I underwent a detective course in Pretoriaand then transferred to Springs.  There I was also promoted inSprings.  I was then transferred to Brakpan as divisional chiefof the detectives.  I then passed my officer's course and I wasthen promoted to lieutenant.  I was transferred to the safetybranch in Johannesburg first Gray? then John Vorster Square. Three months order duty in the Caprivi.  Two years later transferredto Umtata as a captain.  I was second in command of the divisionsecurity branch in Transkei.  Two years service in Rhodesia afterthat.  I was then transferred to the John Vorster Square afterthe independence of the Transkei.  I was stationed for three monthsat John Vorster Square.  After that I was transferred to EastRand Springs where I was second in command of the</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>1A security/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>120 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>security branch as a major then promoted to lieutenant coloneland transferred to Headquarters.  I was commanding officer ofVlakplaas under Brigadier Schoon from 1983 to '85.  I was thentransferred as divisional commander to Northern Transvaal, Pretoriauntil June 1987.  Then I underwent a heart by-pass operation andwas declared unfit.  MR DU PLESSIS:   Brigadier Cronjethis general background which you have given us and which youset out in your application covers certain aspects which are notrelevant to the acts committed by yourself but they serve as ageneral background which could be important.  I am now going todeal with these incidents in the order in which they appear inthe application.  Page 6, the first aspect I would like you tofocus on and to comment is the issue of your recollection of thisapplication.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Unfortunately this is subject to lapse oftime.  I don't have all the particulars regarding each and everyincident, I only have a vague memory.  In certain cases I can'tremember it at all and I would like the question of whether Imade full disclosure to be considered in the light of this, becausemy memory could be defective in certain cases and if certain factsare omitted it's for no other reason that I simply cannot rememberwhat exactly happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you.  If you turn to page 7 I wouldlike you to tell the Committee, we heard General van der Merwe'sevidence yesterday, which is of a more objective nature from theperspective of the Commissioner of Police and of General van derMerwe's perspective regarding the struggle in which the SAP wasinvolved, what I would like you to do, I want to make it veryclear that you are also</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>1A doing/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>121 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>doing this on behalf of the other applicants before the Committee. They were all, to some extent, they all served under you to someextent, I'd like you to sketch to the Committee from your subjectiveperspective how the development of the struggle of the South AfricanGovernment against the liberation organisations developed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Chairperson during the Rhodesian war I performedtwo years service in Rhodesia.  The South African Government decidedthat the South African Police had to be used in support of theRhodesian Defence Force and Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Brigadier when was this, the two-year period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> This was during - I can't remember the dates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Chairperson I may mention here that duringthe preparation of this application Brigadier Cronje's memorywas a bit vague as far as certain events which took place a longtime ago are concerned, so in some instances the dates have notbeen filled in because we weren't able to determine the exactdate and we couldn't obtain his file.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I may also just mention that I lived inRhodesia until the withdrawal of South African troops.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr du Plessis why I am asking this is thatit may become important to determine who had perhaps given theorders during that period and who the responsible person or personswere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> I understand that.  From the early 1980'sonwards there is no problem as far as time periods are concerned. It's actually just the period before that that we have a bitof a problem with.  There are no applications for amnesty as faras that period is concerned except for one incident concerningSwapo.  Brigadier Cronje as far as</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>1A I/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>122 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>I am aware you were involved in the Rhodesian war towards theend, in other words the late 1970's, the end of the period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Could you continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> The South African Police became involvedin the 70's in the guerilla war and counter-insurgency operationswhich did not involve normal functions of policing.  The factthat the South African Police was used in such a way made quitea difference in the training techniques.  The police had to beable to also combat guerillas and take part in a military war. This included all elements of combat, guerilla warfare and counter-insurgencyactivities.  It also included training to kill, self-defence andmilitary tactics.  It also included training relating to interrogationof terrorists and planning of military operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a> The ANC/SACP alliance during the 1970's further started a full-scaleguerilla war against the Republic of South Africa.  The populationwere indoctrinated to believe that there was a full-scale waragainst the Republic of South Africa.  The way in which the guerillawar developed showed that this was a correct view of the situation. The ANC/SACP alliance was supported by the Eastern block countriesand specifically the USSR. </p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURREN:</span> My apologies for the interruption Mr Chairman. We don't all have the benefit of a copy of the statement whichis being read.  Without the copy I must say I am finding it difficultto follow everything.  If I could just ask the witness to reada little bit more slowly it would really help.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>1A CHAIRMAN:/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>123 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I think that for the purpose of the Interpretersas well you should give them a little time so that they can catchup with what you are reading, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> I beg your pardon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Have you a spare copy of the statementbecause I understand there is photostatting equipment availablehere and if we could have another copy of it we can get it photostattedand then made available to counsel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman just give me a minute I amtrying to locate ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Nevertheless I think that when you do readkindly read sufficiently slowly to enable the translators to catchup so that people at the back who don't understand Afrikaans mayfollow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Mpshe I see that the legal representativesare writing on their laps, there is no table available.  Mr Currenis trying to make notes and he's doing it on his lap.  I reallythink that this is not the way in which we should proceed withthis trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman and Members of the Committee a commenthas already been made by an honourable members of the Committeeabout this venue.  Mr Chairman if I have to make a table availablefor everybody it means this table will go right down towards thedoor and that is what I was trying to avoid.  Mr Chairman I havearranged this with the legal representatives that when it comesto cross-examination they will take the table.  But if it is thefeeling of the Committee I will ask that we adjourn for a whileand then I can fit in other tables, for all lawyers to be on tables.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> It does seem that this hall has its limitations</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>1A and/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>124 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>and it may be a bit awkward and difficult for attorneys and counselin this matter here.  Unfortunately we will all just have to dothe best we can.  We have heard that there are limitations andI don't think that Mr Mpshe himself can do very much.  Maybe hewould be able to push a wall or two but I don't think he can domuch more than that.  So let's just see how far we can go in thedifficult circumstances in which we find ourselves.  So pleasebear with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr du Plessis we have prepared guidelineswhich govern proceedings, the way that this Committee runs itsproceedings, I don't know whether you have had a copy thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> I have a copy yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> One of the provisions is that any partywanting to make use of documents will ensure that all other interestedparties receive all copies of such documents as that particularparty wants to use, and I think it may be useful to try and keepto that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.  Mr Chairman I wasn't under the impressionthat that provision included copies of the applications to everyinterested party.  Nobody approached us yesterday except one legalrepresentative approached us yesterday for copies of the applications. I am just trying to locate my copy of the guidelines.  So ifthere are requests for copies of the applications then obviouslywe will endeavour to do so.  We haven't had any requests for copies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I am talking about documents which havebeen - we are now at Exhibit D aren't we?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> So there have been some documents, I amnot</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>1A talking/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>125 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>talking about the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Oh I beg your pardon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I am talking about the documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> I thought you were referring to the applications.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> No.  The guidelines do not refer themselvesto copies of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes I will gladly make available copiesof any documents to anybody who is interested and want extra copies. I have got extra copies of documents available, of the exhibits. So anybody, Mr Curren if you want copies of any of the exhibitsplease just ask me.

<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEINTJIES:</span> If it pleases the Committee I am Roelf Meintjiesfrom the firm Meintjies and Hoegh from Pretoria North.  I am appearingon behalf of Mr J J H van Jaarsveldt, identified as Captain vanJaarsveldt and mentioned in this proceedings.  It refers to theincident of Piet Ntuli as well as any other matter where the gentlemanis identified in these proceedings.  This is apart from the PietNtuli matter.  It also refers to any other incidents with regardto which my client has been identified in the testimony beforethe Committee and is implicated in this testimony.  I must putit on record that my client is a State witness in the intendedcriminal case.  Thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman another legal representative isnot present here today, that is Advocate T Botha from the PretoriaBar representing the Ntuli family.  He was here with us yesterdayMr Chairman.  That is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Is that the killing of Piet Ntuli?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That is so.  Advocate Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman I would like in response tothis, I would like to raise one possible problem which I would like  to  deal with now instead of when it arises.  Mr RoelfMeintjies has placed on record that he appears on behalf  of Captain van Jaarsveldt who is a State witness, he has indicatedto me that he intends, when his client is implicated, he intendsto stand up and put his client's version if it in fact differsfrom the evidence given.  Now as I read</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>the Act, and specifically section 30(2) it says that "Duringany hearing before the Commission, if any person is implicatedin a manner which may be to his or her detriment, the Commissionshall, if</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>1B such/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>130</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>  such person is available afford him or her an opportunity tosubmit representations to the Commission within a specified timewith regard to the matter...."</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>I read that as after the hearing.  And then </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>  "....under consideration, or to give evidence at the hearingof the Commission".</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>I want to place on record here that we do not read the Act asallowing a legal representative on behalf of a person implicatedin evidence simply to stand up and to state his or her client'sversion without that person being able to testify and withoutme being afforded the opportunity to cross-examine that specificwitness.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a> If Captain van Jaarsveldt is a State witness he would clearlybe affected by the application I made yesterday pertaining tothe State witnesses and our attitude is that either he must testifyin these proceedings if he's implicated or otherwise his legalrepresentative cannot simply stand up and put his version withouthim testifying.  I thought it convenient to raise this now sothat we can deal with this matter perhaps now or in any otherway that you deem fit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Meintjies is your client not available?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEINTJIES:</span> Mr Chairman my client is available, he isin this room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And is there any reason why he won't give evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEINTJIES:</span> My client has got no reasons not to giveevidence.  The State has, however, opposed the application bythe applicants and we have already made our decision clear thatwe do accept the decision of this Commission on</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>1B the/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>131</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>the question whether the State witnesses should give evidencebefore the Commission or not.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr du Plessis that section gives the personimplicated the opportunity if that person so wishes to clear himself,to clear his name in whatever best way that person may think. Now I don't know whether it is for us to prescribe to such aperson as to how he should go about clearing his name.  If thatperson chooses, well I don't think really he can stand up everytime, but I would have thought that Mr Meintjies would, at somestage, put questions to such witness as shall have implicatedhis client.  Now he may succeed in so putting questions to theperson implicating his client.  He may succeed in showing thathis client is being wrongly implicated to such an extent thathe may see no need to put his client in the witness box to clearhis name.  And your suggestion has a further difficulty, if weallow Mr Meintjies to put questions to whatever witness, to oneof your clients on the understanding that he should put his clientin as a witness, what if he refuses later to put his client inas a witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Quite clearly if he does not got into the boxand if all we are left with is no direct evidence from him butmerely a statement by his attorney or his counsel, when the timecomes to evaluate that evidence due regard will be taken of thatfact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes I understand that completely.  Theonly reason why I raised this is to make this point clear thatthis is the attitude of Mr Meintjies.  I wanted to make our pointclear that we wanted Captain van Jaarsveldt from the beginningto give evidence and if he simply cross-examines</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>1B and/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>132</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>and puts the version I want the Commission to be clear on thesituation.  On that basis I will accept it.  Mr Chairman obviouslythe value of such statements we will then argue about that atthe end of the hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Are we then ready to proceed wit this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman I am ready, I just want toplace one other aspect on record.  I was approached by certainmembers of the Press asking for copies of the applications andI just want to place on record that we have no obligation, theapplicants have no obligation to provide the Press with copiesof the applications.  The evidence will be read into the recordand it will be treated as evidence on that basis.  I just wantedto place that on record for purposes of the Press.  Thank youMr Chairman, may I go ahead.</p>

<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>Mr du Plessis discusses with Brig Cronje regarding the sound</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> During these riots there were many casesof incitement, damage to property, bombing and shooting.  Manyinnocent civilians suffered as a result.  I was not involved inany of these riots at this time and I was therefore not involvedin any cases where activists were killed or dealt with in anyother way.  I was also not directly not involved in the interrogationof activists.  At that stage I was second in command of the securitybranch in Springs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a> The events took place a long time ago.  My memory is not so goodanymore.  I can't remember specific events which took place duringthat time in which I was involved or which I ordered.  The UnitedDemocratic Front was established in 1983 and from 1983 they wagedfullscale guerilla war.  This was done by the internal wing ofthe ANC, namely the UDF, until approximately 1989.  The situationwas that there was a fullscale war which included death, tortureand other actions committed by activists as set out above in respectof the Soweto riots.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a> The South African government's approach was that there was atotal onslaught against the country at all levels and that wereinvolved in war. Security legislation was promulgated and otheremergency measures instituted.  This happened in 1985, at thestart of '85 and it was made permanent in June 1986.  During thisconflict South Africa was infiltrated by activists of the ANC/SACPalliance as well as the PAC.  These activists continued to tryand make the country ungovernable.  All the acts were aimed at</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>1B destabilising/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>134 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>destabilising the country.  Actions committed by them includednecklace murders, ordinary murders, assaults, robbery, arson,damage to property, intimidation, the organising of school boycottsand consumer boycotts, bombings and stonings.  These actions hadto be countered by the South African Police. </p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a> The South African Police were forced at that stage to act ina way which was not in line with normal conduct in times of peace. It was necessary to institute counter measures against the actionsof the activists and therefore to act outside normal policingchannels as well as outside the confines of the legal system. The nature of the events as they escalated therefore led to ablurring of the distinction between lawful actions and objectives. It was necessary, sanctioned and approved that the South AfricanPolice use methods and act in ways which would not be acceptablein normal peace times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a> The training of the South African Police also had to be adaptedto focus more on the military component of training as it wasnecessary for the daily functioning of the South African Police. This was especially applicable to people involved in the securitybranch of the South African Police.  The ultimate result was thatduring the period of 1983 to '89 was that there was in realitya fullscale, almost a conventional war in South Africa and thattechniques and actions were based on military models, militarystyle operations were performed and actions of a military naturewere undertaken by the SAP.  Use was further made of informersand agents relating to the gathering of information and the conveyingof such information.  Espionage was the order of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>1B violations/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>135 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>From the above it is clear that there were gross </p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>violations of human rights on both sides of the spectrum.  Onthe side of the ANC/SACP alliance, as well as the PAC the well-knownexamples of the necklace murders, consumer boycotts, school boycotts,strikes, arson, group murders, uprisings and riots in generalcan be clearly recalled by anyone who lived in South Africa during1983 to 1989.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a> It was also so that members of the South African Police, duringthat period had to be indoctrinated and to be persuaded that whathad to be done in the circumstances had to be done with one objectivenamely to protect and maintain the State and the National Partyso that the State would not be overthrown by the liberation movementsand to combat the onslaught of the ANC/SACP and PAC and otherliberation movements against the South African government. </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a> Normal policing functions, therefore, took a back seat in thesecircumstances.  It was especially members of the security policewho were involved in operations and this was necessitated by virtueof the situation of war.  It was also expected of them to formthe backbone of the attack against the ANC/SACP and PAC.  Thesecurity police were in the crossfire of this war and acted like,for instance, select units and battalions in the Namibian bushwar.  A good example of this is for instance 32 battalion, specialforces and Koevoet as far as the police was concerned. </p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a> The security police in the Republic of South Africa found themselvesin exactly the same situation.  It was the security police whohad to counter the infiltration of terrorists and activists andwho had to combat the actions of terrorists and activists.  Forthat reason it was that members of the security police were mostinvolved in </p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>1B multiple/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>136 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>multiple violations of human rights necessitated by the circumstancesand by virtue of the situation of war which existed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a> A distinction cannot be drawn between a conventional war anda guerilla war which was waged by the ANC/SACP and PAC in theRepublic of South Africa in that time.  It was only the methodsof warfare which differed but it cannot be denied that guerillawarfare was nothing other than just a different form of warfare.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a> In the light of the above it was therefore necessary to eliminateinsurgents, terrorists and activists where the circumstances justifiedit.  If such persons were not eliminated in these circumstancesthey would not be permanently neutralised by way of the securitylegislation, detention and by means of normal legal procedures. The legal system was simply not equipped or able to deal withthese situations and to counter the soldiers of the ANC, SACPand PAC.  The struggle had to be waged on a military level, asa war, and for that reason the elimination of terrorists and activistswere seen as justified and were regarded as part of the struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a> There were active steps taken to prevent the killing of innocentpeople, so we acted in a preventive way.  If only the acts ofthe ANC, SACP and PAC activists and terrorists are taken intoconsideration one can come to no other conclusion than that therewas a fullscale war in the country.  Acts included, amongst others,various bomb explosions such as a motor car bomb in Church Street,Pretoria, various other car bomb explosions, limpet mine explosionsand incidences of sabotage, landmine explosions, murder and otheracts of terror.

So it has a specific reference to securityforces.  Brigadier the next page the Hans Commission, statisticsfor acts of terror for the year.</p>

In the light of the above it happenedthat from time-to-time general orders were given by commandingofficers to their subordinates to take steps to combat certainsituations. Such orders were general orders which didn't necessarilyinclude a specific authorisation for each and every operationto be undertaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a> The authority to issue orders was delegated further down thestructure of command and a Brigadier in the position which I foundmyself and other officers were increasingly confronted with generalorders in terms of which action had to be taken on a broader basisthan what would normally be the case.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>allowed a greater degree of discretion before authority had tobe obtained.  This was necessitated by virtue of the situationand this was exacerbated during the state of emergency.  Obviouslyauthority could not be specifically granted for each and everyaction of the subordinates.  Sometimes authority was granted beforehand,in other cases commanding officers were only informed of certainactions after they had already taken place.  In such cases thiswas normally caused as a result of a need to act immediately andthe practical impossibility of obtaining authorisation for eachand every instance from commanding officers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could you just stop there for a moment.You say here that the power to grant instructions were thereforedelegated further down the structure of command and a brigadieretc had to carry out orders, was there ever a meeting at whichthis was decided that the powers and functions had to be delegatedfurther down the hierarchy and structure of command and that decisionscould be taken at own discretion or how were these powers extended?

<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> The actions of the South African Policeto combat the onslaught of the liberation organisations were undertakenin the performance of the duties of the South African Police andformed part of the structure of the SAP and specifically the securitybranch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a> Insofar as subordinates under my command took such action aimedat fighting the war in which we found ourselves and which wasaimed against the actions of liberation movements who were tryingto destabilise the country and trying to overthrow the governmentI am morally obliged to assume responsibility for that, all actionsof my subordinates within the confines of Brigadier Victor's commandwhich I will now deal with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a> In early 1986 I was contacted by Brigadier Victor who was secondin command of the counter insurgency unit.  Due to the structureof the SAP at that stage Brigadier Victor was my senior and Iwould have been compelled to accept orders and instructions fromhim.  He told me that he had called in Captain Jacque Hechterand gave him the instruction, along with his son, this son ofhis was a lieutenant at the time, and stationed at Mamelodi, tobring the riots in Pretoria under control.  It didn't matter howit was done and what was done.  He said that Pretoria was burningand that South Africa was burning.  He said that all necessarysteps should be taken to normalise the situation and bring itunder control.  He further said that if a policeman's house wasattacked immediate steps had to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>2A taken/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>142 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>taken against the person who was responsible for that act.  Sucha person's house would then have to be burnt down as well.  Hisorders were to the effect that when we retaliated we should justgo a step further than the enemy each time.  His instructionsamounted to the security police taking active steps in the struggleagainst terrorists and activists.  What his orders in realityamounted to was that the same methods had to be used and thatthere was in reality an active guerilla war to be waged againstthe ANC, SACP and PAC activists as well as activists from otherliberation organisations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a> Before Brigadier Victor's command the security police acted ina reactionary way only, and this meant that activists responsiblefor offences and other acts aimed at destabilising the countrywere arrested and dealt with in terms of the existing legislation,including security legislation.  At the stage of Brigadier Victor'scommand it was clear that reactionary conduct was not sufficientto stem the tide of riots, violence and destabilisation.  At thatstage a fullscale war was entered upon.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a> In terms of Brigadier Victor's command, from that stage onwardsuse was made of guerilla warfare tactics and a fullscale guerillawar was waged against the liberation organisations.  It was ofa pro-active nature to prevent acts of terror and to neutraliseactivists before they could commit acts of terror rather thanmerely to react to acts of terror.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a> I accepted that this instruction by Brigadier Victor had comefrom a higher authority.  I informed Brigadier Victor that I wouldmake staff available to his son and Captain Hechter in order toact in such a manner.  As far as 2A I/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>143 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>I know this same procedure was followed in all the other divisionsof the security police throughout the country.  It's a generallyaccepted way of action and it was never repudiated or addressedby either Head Office, the Commissioner of Police, the State SecurityCouncil, the Cabinet or the government.  As far as I understoodit and I continue to be convinced of this the change to pro-activeaction against the liberation movements was done with the authorisationof the government of the day.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a> All actions under my jurisdiction which happened in this mannerwere taken up in situation reports which were sent through ona daily basis to my head office.  The procedure was that furtherreports with this information would then have been passed on tothe State Security Council.  Events which took place under mycommand in the Security Branch in Pretoria was, therefore, passedonto Head Office and must have been taken up in reports to theState Security Council.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a> I must mention Chair that every morning an information reportwas sent through to Head Office.  Every incident of the previousday was mentioned in this report, such as for instance I maintainedfiles on activists, the same file was kept at the Head Office,if an activist, therefore, was killed on a particular day or hishouse was burnt down, that information would have been passedon to Head Office with a file reference and the instructions,the events and the information would have been discussed at ameeting of all the heads at security head office.  This is theSan Hedrun to which General van der Merwe referred to yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a> I do not believe anyone in my Head Office could have been sonaive as to believe that the ANC were killing and</p>

<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>144 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a> attacking their own people.  They must have known what the truefacts were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a> There were monthly meetings at the Joint Control Centre wherethese incidents were discussed.  At the Joint Control Centre therewere representatives of the SADF, SAP the Education Department,Civil Defence as well as other State institutions.  Minutes ofthe JCC meetings were sent through to the State Security Council. I do not doubt that the actions of my subordinates and the eventswhich took place under my command at the Security Branch, NorthernTransvaal, just have been known by the State Security Council.</p>

Brigadier a coupleof questions I wish to ask you also referring to this particularevidence.  Concerning the filing system could you give the Committeean idea of the number of files, just broadly speaking, the numberof files which the Northern Transvaal Security Branch was keptin your offices?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I don't know the exact number but therewere a lot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> These are not files kept in your personaloffice, there was a filing system?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> There was a filing room, yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>149 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>something new.  We are trying to obtain a copy of the programmeand specifically the relevant parts thereof to be able to showit to you because I don't know if everybody on the Committee hasseen the programme.  There is tonight a follow-up programme at9 o'clock.  The programme is called "Prime-Evil" sothere will be a follow-up, if I may just mention that.  We willendeavour to find, especially the excerpt of President Botha wherehe talked about elimination.  We deem it important to introducethat as part of the evidence.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Wouldn't it be better, if you are goingto ask us to rely on the programme, that we should see the wholeprogramme rather than bits personally selected by you?  MRDU PLESSIS:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  I don't have any problempertaining to that.  It would be to the applicant's advantagein that one of the State witnesses that the Attorney General hasfought so valiantly for, namely Mr Joe Mamasela, has given hiswhole version on the handgrenade incident on television last night. And I would - therefore it would assist the applicants and Iwould have no problem in showing the whole programme.  Perhapsat this point one could make a specific arrangement in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr du Plessis thank you, you solved my dilemmabecause yesterday night I wasn't sure, as a member of the AmnestyCommittee whether I should watch that programme or not, so I assumeyou have no problem if I watch that programme?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> I have no problem whatsoever.  The onlypoint I would want to make is in the evidence, and that will becomeclear and I will argue that at the end of the day as well, isthat there should be, to a large extent, a</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>2A distinction/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>150 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>distinction made between the actions of Colonel de Kock and CaptainDirk Coetzee and my clients.  We will show that my clients, theapplicants, did not act exactly in the same way and we will indicateto you, the evidence will be that the applicants never received,for instance, any monetary or financial gain in respect of anythingthat they did.  We will draw a definite distinction between usand those two persons who were also at Vlakplaas, Dirk Coetzeebefore Brigadier Cronje and Colonel de Kock after Brigadier Cronje.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a> Brigadier Cronje could you continue, the second paragraph onpage 17.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> An example of the fact that instructionscame right from the top would have been the instruction givento me by General van der Merwe, then Brigadier van der Merwe touse handgrenades with the zero ignition device against ANC activistswho wanted to obtain these arms.  This instruction was given tome in Springs by General van der Merwe and during this instructionhe specifically indicated to me that this came directly from MinisterLe Grange and that it had indeed been authorised by PresidentP W Botha, as well as Commissioner Johan Coetzee, both of whomknew about this and authorised it.  If such an instruction camedirectly from President Botha it could not be other than thatthe general instructions to bring the situation under instructionas per the instruction of Brigadier Victor must have come directlyfrom the top.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> May I just interrupt you Brigadier, itis correct that the event with regard to the handgrenades happenedprior to the instruction of Brigadier Victor, is that the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> That is the case.  If it should be claimed</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a>2A therefore/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>151 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>therefore by anyone that the State Security Council was not awareof the actions of the security forces and the security policeor of any specific incidents this would not be true.   BrigadierSchoon, during 1986 was in command of the terrorist division atthe security head office.  He phoned me one morning and told methat the Commissioner of Police gave him instructions, then GeneralJohan Coetzee, gave him instructions that the security policeand particularly my staff had to work with special forces.  Hisinstructions to me was to cooperate with the SADS special forces. </p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a> I must just mention here Chair, that there had always been somedisagreement between the SADF and the South African Police thatwe had difficulty in cooperating.  The SADF special forces wasa specialised combat group which undertook covert operations. If Brigadier Schoon for instance gave me instructions to workwith Military Intelligence I would not have considered an instructionto wage war.  But the instruction to work with special serviceswas a direct instruction to become engaged in military warfare. This instruction was given to me somewhat after the instructionfrom Brigadier Victor but the two instructions were given withina couple of months from each other.  I accepted this instructionfrom Brigadier Schoon and respected it as an instruction to becomedirectly militarily engaged and to counter the onslaught activelyin a military manner.  This was no longer normal policing functionsof normal policing tasks which I was authorised to exercise. My responsibilities became far broader.  All instructions, therefore,which I gave to my subordinates or which in another manner wastransferred to my subordinates must be seen against the backgroundof these two </p>

<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>152 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>instructions.  It must be seen as instructions to act in a situationand circumstances of war.  These actions must therefore be seenas military actions in a context of guerilla warfare.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> An additional question Brigadier, whatwould your view have been during the struggle with regard to thetask of the security police, with regard to the National Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> The security police worked for the NationalParty.  We had to carry out their instructions to keep them ingovernment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Your view with regard to apartheid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I grew up during a time in which apartheidexisted.  I was indoctrinated to believe that apartheid was right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> What would the task have been of the securitypolice with regards to both apartheid and communism, could yougive us some more information in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> With regard to apartheid and communism ourtask was at all times to combat communism in every possible way. With regard to apartheid, our task was to maintain apartheidand to maintain the National Party government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier would this have been the viewof your subordinates?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Would that have been the view communicatedto you by your superiors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Indeed it was pressed on our hearts at everypossible occasion that we should suppress apartheid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> You mean communism?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a>2A BRIG CRONJE:/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>153 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I am sorry I mean communism.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> For a moment I was quite surprised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> We had to maintain the apartheid government. That is what I intended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier there is a further aspect, whichis a recurring question appearing in the application form.  Iam going to ask you this question particularly, we have dealtwith it but did you ever obtain every financial gain with regardto any of the actions you committed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No, never Chair, neither did any of my subordinates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you.  Brigadier could you continueon page 19, the actions of activists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> The normal actions of activists to causedestabilisation and to destroy the State included the following,arson, bombings, school boycotts, consumer boycotts, damage toproperty, murder of police and council members, the burning downof the houses of policemen, intimidation, sabotage and similarcrimes.  This action was a continuing militant onslaught on thesecurity of the Republic aimed at innocent persons with the intentionto overthrow the State. It was this action which had to be countered. It was a military onslaught.  It was war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Could you continue to explain to the Committeehow the process worked with regard to informants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Informants were used by the Security Policeto obtain information with regard to who the activists were. Informants were paid for information as they supplied this fromtime-to-time.  There were many informants available for the useof the Security Branch.  Sometimes persons who had previouslybeen activists were used, after their</p>

<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>154 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>rehabilitation, as informants.  Without informants the securitypolice would not have been able to work and would have been veryineffective.  Due to the information from informants files werecomposed with regard to the troublemakers, the most active activists. Specific goals were then determined with regard to the actionsto be taken.  MR DU PLESSIS:   With regard to instructions,we have already discussed this, I do not want to deal with thisin a detailed way but I do want to ask you ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I just want to pose one question to theBrigadier, did you evaluate the information that you receivedfrom the various informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> We did evaluate this information.  We neveracted simply on information from a single informer.  We had tohave information from two or three informers and then we reacted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did you receive information directly fromTREVETS?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I was aware of TREVETS.  We were not representedon that branch but it was possible for me to make representationsto TREVETS.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Can you just briefly tell us how you, whatthis process of rehabilitating activists entailed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> After the interrogation of an activist wetreated them in such a manner, and we indoctrinated them in sucha way that they, in certain instances, turned to our side, andin certain cases even given rank and they became members of theSouth African Police, they were appointed to the South AfricanPolice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Brigadier did this information (...tapeends)</p>

<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>assault and torture, as I has said subsequently these people werealso treated in such a way that we then treated them well so thatthey changed sides.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Brigadier on thenext page we deal with instructions, I don't want you to readthe entire section but do read from the fifth line from the bottomstarting with "Opdragte vat ek ontvang het".</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Instructions which I received were seldomin writing.  I only received instructions directly, personally,and then relayed it to my subordinates on a personal basis suchas for instance Captain Hechter.  It was not always easy to remembersuch instructions, or the particular terms in which the instructionwas shaped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> You were not able to obtain any documentationor you do not have any documentation in your possession with regardto any of these instructions received or given by yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No this is the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> The next page with regard to TREVETS?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> TREVETS was a secret organisation.  It wascalled TREVETS, that's the Counter-revolutionary Information TargetCentre.  It was formed in 1985.  Initially it identified targetsin the neighbouring states, terrorist bases etc, but it was laterextended to targets within the Republic.  It is possible thatthe instruction with regard to Piet Ntuli came from TREVETS. TREVETS obtained and gathered information from the various regionswith regard to particular targets and then there were monthlymeetings during which the information of all the sectors, suchas Military Intelligence, National Intelligence, the SecurityBranch of the SAP and the Special Forces of the South</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>2B African/...</p>

<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>African Defence Force were discussed, considered, and targetswere identified.  At that time C1 was the Vlakplaas Unit.  C2was the Interrogation Unit and C3 was TREVETS.  Every region hadits own Target Analysis Centre and the regions were Western Transvaal,Northern Transvaal, Far North, Northern Cape and Eastern Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a> Colonel Tom Louw was responsible, or was initially in commandof TREVETS with executive chief General Buchner who was functioningin 1987 and after that under General Bob Beukes and subsequentlyunder Brigadier Victor.  Targets were identified by TREVETS. There was a representative from Military Intelligence and SADFSpecial Forces.  Every region maintained records with regard towho were activists, who came from which region and who causedtrouble.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a> Colonel Louw made a document out of the information which wasthen used to identify targets.  It was a secret component sinceonly persons working with terrorism cooperated with it.  A prioritylist was maintained.  The State Security Council knew of the existenceof TREVETS, particularly with regard to its actions outside theRepublic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Brigadier.  Could you continuewith regard to the death of activists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Within the context of the previously sketchedwar situation there were circumstances under which activists hadto be eliminated by killing them.  It's the only way in this warsituation in which activists could be effectively acted against. Merely arresting them in terms of security legislation was insufficientas it was of a limited and brief duration.  To charge such a personand take them through the formal legal structures and procedureswas</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>2B cumbersome/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>157 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>cumbersome and insufficient and impossible and there was no otherchoice than to take normal war action and to eliminate activists. This was considered necessary under the circumstances.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a> Reports with regard to the death of activists was passed on toHead Office and there was never any repudiation or instructionsto stop these eliminations, or discontinue these eliminations. Under the circumstances there were files where the file numberof the person was given to the Head Office and nothing was donesubsequently with regard to this death.  Under these circumstancesit was considered necessary to eliminate activists in defenceof the State and to combat the revolutionary efforts against theState of the ANC, SACP, PAC and other liberation movements.  Itwas done to protect innocent civilians including primarily Blackcivilians who suffered under the riotous and destabilising actionsof activists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> A question Brigadier.  Was the informationsystem of the Security Police sufficient with regard to the particularactions of activists or operations of terrorists to stop theseactions before they occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> The information system of the South AfricanPolice, the Security Police was of the best in the world.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> If you listen to my question, was thesecurity system good enough that you were able to foresee andact against terrorists so that you could prevent actions?  Didyou know every time where terrorists were going to act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes.  We did not always know Chair.  Justrepeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> What I want to know is whether your</p>

<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a>158 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a>information system was good enough to act preventatively?  Didyou know every time when terrorists were going to attack a particularhouse, were you able to stop them before they could do this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No this was not at all possible.  We hadto act by eliminating them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier just generally or broadly speakingthese activists who were eliminated or who you decided to eliminatewhat kind of person would this normally have been and what actionswould they already have been responsible for?  This is just broadlyspeaking.  What kind of actions would have been committed alreadyby these activists to justify their elimination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Arson, throwing stones, attacking the housesof police persons, school boycotts, consumer boycotts, necklacing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier would you have eliminated activistswho were only guilty of minor actions or very serious actions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Only in the case of really serious actions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier could you continue to the nexttopic, the Racial Foundation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> The struggle was never racially based. Investigations into actions by White persons also came under myjurisdiction on occasion.  I cannot remember specific instancesbut it was dealt with in exactly the same manner as actions againstBlack activists.  The difference was that there had not been awar situation between right-wing organisations and the governmentof the day.  It was therefore not considered necessary to eliminateWhite right-wing persons in the same way as activists.  The</p>

<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a>actions of the security branch, Northern Transvaal, of which Iwas in command, therefore never was aimed at a Black/White conflict,was never involved in racism.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier this is apart from the factthat you supported apartheid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> That is the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier let me make it clear, it appearsthat there are persons who do not understand your testimony. Your actions against activists, was it actions against them becausethey were Black?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Was your action against activists aimedagainst them because they were persons, against terrorists andactivists was this aimed against them because they were personsguilty of criminal actions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Insofar as this related to acts of terror,yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Were your actions aimed to combat thearmed struggle of the ANC and other liberation movements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Were there occasions when you acted againstWhite activists who supported liberation movements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes there were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Brigadier for clarifying this. Brigadier could you continue with the next topic, the effectof the actions of the security branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> The pro-active actions of the security branchagainst the onslaught on the government was remarkably effective. It was so effective that the division Northern Transvaal hadthe least incidents of all the regions in the Republic of SouthAfrica at a later stage.  The pro-active</p>

<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>action was therefore justified under the circumstances and hadresults.  It combatted the onslaught on the State by the liberationmovements and prevented further destabilisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Could you continue to the next topic,the next general topic with regard to the destruction of documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I had already retired when the instructionwas given to destroy documentation.  If documentation was availabletoday it would have eased my task in this application for amnesty. I do not have any documentation in my possession in support ofmy application with regard to specific incidents except that withregard to which I have referred in this document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Do you have any personal knowledge ofthe destruction of documentation by the security police?</p>

<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Did people tell you anything in this regard?</p>

<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier the next topic which I wantyou to touch on briefly is the modus operandi at Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> While I was in command of Vlakplaas I hadfour sections under my command.

<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I want to state it quite clearly that inview of the number of incidents which took place in my periodat Vlakplaas particularly during 1983 to '89 that I don't haveknowledge and I cannot remember all the actions of my subordinates. I call on such subordinates to apply for amnesty  and to revealthe facts and particulars with regard to these actions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a> As far as memory allows I have attempted to remember every incidentwith which I was involved where there had been human rights violationsand which therefore falls under the ambit of this legislation,as well as the actions of my subordinates. </p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a> During my preparation for this application I was reminded bysome of these subordinates of a number of events which I had alreadyforgotten and with regard to which I have now been reminded.

<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier might we look at the next topic,Propaganda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> A war psychosis had been created by theSouth African government using media, television, newspapers,churches and cultural organisation promoting the belief that therehad been a total onslaught on the country, built around the ideathat this was a struggle against communism.  The true picturewas never revealed to the White South African community. Propagandain every form had been used.  The Press, the media was kept outof areas with serious unrest and therefore South Africa and therest of the world did not know what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a>  Security forces were on a daily basis convinced to act againstthe liberation movements in the context of total onslaught andthe struggle against communism.  There had not been proper communicationbetween government and White voters.  As the struggle continuedmembers of the SAP had to act more and more outside normal policingframeworks and the legal system.  It became more and more a warsituation.  Eventually both sides of the struggle believe thathuman rights violations were necessary in the course of the struggleand such violations were committed on both sides.   Previous commissionersof the South African Police in their presentations to the Commissionaccepted collective responsibility for actions within this contextof struggle.  A particular incident of such propaganda can befound in the book of President Mandela, Long Walk to Freedom,on page 405 2B where/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>163 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a>where President Mandela says the following:-</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a>  "By definition if a man worked for the present servicehe was probably brainwashed by the government's propaganda.  Hewould have believed that we were terrorists and communists whowanted to drive the White man into the sea".</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a>Against this background the struggle against the liberation movementscontinued.  The propaganda with which we were fed is thereforeconfirmed by President Mandela himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Brigadier.  The next page thenyou mention the filing system of the security branch.  There hadbeen testimony by General van der Merwe in this regard and I amnot going to ask you to handle this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a> Mr Chairman that finalises the general evidence in respect ofBrigadier Cronje.  I want to say one thing, and that is that inrespect of the motivation, in respect of certain deeds, why thesedeeds were committed with a political motive, we had to repeatobviously the motivation every time in respect of every deed,now with your permission I can deal with this either now to sayto you in general, part of the motivation, not the whole motivationbut part of the motivation in respect of where an activist waseliminated would be the following, and then I could deal withthis evidence.  Otherwise I will have to deal with the evidencerepeatedly again in respect of each and every incident.  I amin your hands in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I think it would be convenient for you to dealwith the matter at this stage, rather than repeat it over andover again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I might statethat part of this motivation was also incorporated in the</p>

<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a>applications of the other applicants, so it will also be applicablethen as evidence to the applications of the other applicants. I also want to state that the evidence by Brigadier Cronje, now,was also in general incorporated in the applications of the otherapplicants and would therefore, with your permission, serve asevidence pertaining to their applications as well.  That wouldmean that I don't have to lead evidence on these aspects fromthe other witnesses as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier may I take you to page 58, it'sthe place in your application where you motivate why you actedwith a political goal in the elimination of Nyana in Swaziland. This is an incident with regard to which testimony will be presented,but for record purposes could you indicate your political purposesin the elimination of this activist.  Could you read this? Thismotivation only has to do with the broader, political contextof the purposes with the elimination of the activists, could youbegin reading on page 58 where you said the intention was in threeparts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> The purpose was, in three parts, (a) intimidation,(b) to influence White voters and (c) the protection of informationand prevention of acts of terror.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a>(A) - Intimidation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a> Intimidation of activists and terrorists and their supportersnot to continue in these actions and to act preventatively withregard to the elimination of potential activists and terrorists. The supporters and sympathisers of the liberation movements suchas the ANC were discouraged to provide open support and momentumto the freedom struggle.  There was a total feeling of mistrustamongst MK </p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a>2B members/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a>165 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>members and supporters with regard to whom they could trust andwho not.  The modus operandi was the same as that of theMossad and that is that all the participants in the struggle againstthe apartheid government had to know that the security policewould strike back immediately after action by activists, theirsupporters and terrorists in a similar way and that this couldlead to the elimination of activists and terrorists.  Such eliminationhappened generally with regard to persons of high profile or veryeffective activists whose arrest could have led to momentum inthe freedom struggle.  Such detentions would have served the freedomstruggle.  The purpose was to demoralise MK and other militarywings of freedom fighters with the result that they were not ableto act as effectively in the struggle and to achieve the purposesof the liberation organisations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a> With regard to the influencing of White voters.  White voterswho had to vote for the government of the day had to trust thesecurity forces and had to believe that they continued to controlthe country.  A disinformation effort with regard to the effectivityof the struggle against communism terrorism had to create theimpression that the security forces could easily win the war sinceactivists disappeared or were killed in mysterious ways withoutany way of finding the guilty parties. </p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a> With regard to the zero handgrenade acts the impression had tobe created that terrorists blew themselves up because they werepoorly trained.  The public thought that the security police werebusy with the elimination of terrorists and activists and therewas a false impression with regard to effectivity with regardto the destruction and </p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a>2B elimination/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a>166 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a>elimination of terrorists and the Red threat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a> There had to be trust in the apartheid government to convinceWhite people to vote for them.  Actions against activists andterrorists created the impression that South Africa was involvedin a struggle for life and death. Our actions maintained the trustof White voters in the apartheid government and convinced themto vote for this government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a> With regard to the detection of information and the preventionof acts of terror it was necessary to eliminate activists in orderto protect the information gained under interrogation.  As soonas it was known that a particular activist had been arrested andthat information was obtained it would have made the interrogationprocess useless in the sense that this information would haveserved - Let me state this differently, if this information cameout then the persons who dealt with this person would have changedtheir plans terrorists in safe houses would have escaped and wewould have had no opportunity to find them. </p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a> The identity of informants and sources of security police hadto be protected.  A person would immediately have known who hadbetrayed him to the security police and that person's life wouldthen have been worth nothing.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a> Where activists in training within or outside the country wherethey intended to go for training they had to be eliminated toprevent them from destabilising the country through acts of terrorismsuch as bombing attacks on security forces as well as soft targets. As soon as an activist had been trained he was in a differentclass to normal activists and his knowledge and skills were thenequal to that of the security police and he would have been </p>

<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a> All of these, therefore, led to the continued government by theNational Party and the successful combatting of communism. </p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Brigadier, only up to there. Would I be correct Brigadier if I were to say that the securitypolice acted preventatively with regard to acts of terror?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> That is correct Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Would it be correct to say that your approachhad been that a person who was going to commit an act of terrorshould rather have been eliminated prior to the act of terror?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a> Mr Chairman just for clarity sake we divided the actions intothree different categories.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I understand that the Interpreter did not hearthe answer given by the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> I am sorry.  Brigadier would it be correctto say that the security forces acted preventatively with regardto terrorists and the elimination of terrorists and activists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> That is correct Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Would I be correct if I were to say Brigadierthat the approach had been that activists and terrorists who weregoing to commit acts of terror should rather be eliminated beforein a preventative way, that they had to be stopped from actingin such a way by means of elimination rather than allowing themto commit acts of terror?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman I just want to make this clear</p>

<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a>168 BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a>for purposes of the applications.  We divided the actions intothree different categories which we tried to motivate every timein the same fashion.  The first one deals with eliminations. The second one deals with interrogations.  The third one dealswith bomb explosions.  In respect of those three categories wedrafted a general motivation which Brigadier Cronje, the one thathe gave now is an example of, those general motivations we includedin each instance of each applicant where there was an eliminationor where there was a bomb explosion or where there was an interrogation. So you will find this explanation of Brigadier Cronje also hasa part of the explanation pertaining to the political motive inCaptain Hechter's application, in Warrant Officer van Vuuren'sapplication and the other applications.  It does not mean thatthat is the only motivation.  In each incident there will be aspecific further motivation pertaining to the specific facts ofthat incident.  But we deemed it necessary to include a generalmotivation in respect of these three different categories of actions. That is why I deem it important to lead the evidence now andto ask you to regard this evidence then in respect of each suchincident in respect of the other applicants.  I will indicateevery time when we deal with the specific action what motivationwas included without letting the witness read it.  I hope youfollow me.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier Cronje would you therefore onpage 79 continue, also with regard to the general motivation andapproach with regard to interrogations and why interrogationshad political purposes.  You may start in the middle of the page.</p>

<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a>parts, (a) intimidation, (b) to obtain information.  When activistswere interrogated they were intimidated to desist from their actionsand also to inform other activists that they will be combattedwith every means and interrogated with every means.  They hadto understand the message that we were serious in our actionsagainst them.  These are activists who were not eliminated bylater released.  During interrogations and when certain informationhad been obtained there was an effort to convince activists andterrorists to become informants for the security police.  Theseactivists and terrorists who turned were the most effective wayto combat the purposes of the liberation movements.  A strikingexample is Joe Mamasela, as is clear from these applications.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a> Askaris.  These are terrorists who became informants ...(tapeends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a>of warfare by agents, insurgents, activists and terrorists.  Informationwith regard to structures of command, lines of command, intelligencechannels were of the greatest importance.  Without effective interrogationtechniques no network of information would have been obtained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a> To combat the total onslaught interrogation had to be effectivewith regard to the obtaining of information.  Information wasobtained with regard to potential acts of terror, their planningand their execution.  Successful counter-strategies and preventativemeasures were then possible with the help of this information. Information with regard to activists were obtained also by meansof interrogation.  The interrogative methods was a means to anend.  Any effective method was acceptable in the context of warand the total onslaught.</p>

<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman that is the general motivation. I don't want him to go ahead with the motivation of this specificincident.  Mr Chairman if you will just bear with me for one momentplease.  Mr Chairman the third category, namely bomb explosionswas not dealt with by Brigadier Cronje in his application specifically. It was, however, dealt with in some of the other witnesses' applicationsand I will then lead the evidence pertaining to that.  I can leadit obviously with Brigadier Cronje, perhaps that would be themore prudent way of doing that if you would allow me to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> If he can give evidence on the matter thenhe must do so.</p>

<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> The purpose of bombings were in two parts,intimidation and disinformation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a> With regard to intimidation activists and their supporters knewthat if they were involved in unrest throwing of petrol bombsand other general destabilisation in a particular area they ortheir property would be attacked by means of a bomb or petrolbomb.  If activists became too well-known or militant or veryeffectively encouraged the consciousness of freedom or for freedomof a particular community they would necessarily have receiveda bomb and their supporters would have had a strong intuitionwith regard to the source of the bomb.  This would have discouragedthem from supporting freedom movements since they would not haveknown who was next on the list.  Activists and their supportersdid specifically believe that it was the security police who werebombing them and burning down their houses if they became activelyand successfully involved.  This action was successful insofaras it discouraged political activists from getting involved indestabilising activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a> With regard to disinformation it was presented to the generalpublic that this was simply Black on Black violence which destabilisedthe country, particularly in Black living areas and that it wasa power struggle amongst Blacks.  This encouraged the fear ofWhites with regard to the possibility of actions which could haveentered their living areas.  This created the perception thatSouth Africa was in a life and death struggle.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a> Voters were encouraged in view of the Black power to vote forthe National Party and to maintain it in power.  This disinformationsystem worked.  The intention of this </p>

Brigadier CronjeI want to ask you one last question, this general kind of instructionthat you received from Brigadier Victor, let me rather ask youin Afrikaans.  This general order which you received from BrigadierVictor which you explained to us are you aware, was it your perceptionwhether this was applicable throughout the country, was that thesituation in the whole country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I have already said on page 16 that as faras I am aware the same action was taken throughout the country,for instance the Motherwell bomb explosion case, Trustfeed caseand the Pepco 3.

We want to raise with the Committeethe possibility that Brigadier Cronje should be cross-examinedin respect of his evidence when he testifies about every incidentwhen he is called, that he is not cross-examined now.  We havealso discussed it with the legal representatives and I believenobody has objection against that.  That would enable us to startwith Colonel Venter and specifically the Pepco 3 incident whichhas become urgent now, if that would...... </p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a> I may just mention Mr Chairman that in respect of the Pepco 3incident members of the family and legal representatives havecome all the way from Port Elizabeth and it's going to incur extracosts if we run into tomorrow.  That's the only reason why wewant to do it now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Well I think it is an imminently sensible suggestionthat the cross-examination of the witness should be postponeduntil after he has given evidence in his own application.</p>

<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So they've all started their, the hearingfor all of them has commenced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> I am in your hands Mr Chairman, that'swhy I am raising this point.  If you give an indication that theyare entitled long before the evidence is given about the contentsof the applications then we have no problem, as long as the applicantsdon't forego their right to amnesty because of the fact that thecontents are disclosed to people outside the process.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr du Plessis I can't think that they could</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a>3A forego/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a>175</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a>forego their right for amnesty in that event.  I think the peopleare entitled to prepare and I don't know what my colleagues wouldfeel, but you've asked that documents in the Attorney General'spossession be made available to yourself, I can see no objectionto that.    </p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr - would you just refer me ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURREN:</span> Section 19(8) (a and b) and our interpretationis that the moment the hearing commences we are entitled to copiesof all the documents that were referred to in section 19(8)(a)and that would certainly include all the relevant documentationthat pertained to our clients.  We would be inclined to say thatthe hearing has commenced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Why are you entitled to copies of them,why should they pay to give you copies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURREN:</span> We didn't ask them to give - we just askedthem to enable us to make copies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> That's different.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURREN:</span> That's what we asked for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Well that's not what we were told.  Wewere told you asked for copies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURREN:</span> No, no, no, we asked if we could have a copyso we could make copies for ourselves and we were declined.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes Mr Chairman I am sorry, perhaps Iformulated it not in the right way.  Mr Curren said that theywill make the copies themselves and I want to refer you to subsection8(b) which also refers to the fact that the Commission can decideto release the information.  That is why we say we are not difficultabout this.  We don't really want to oppose it strenuously, wesimply raised this point and we asked that you make a ruling onthis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> But Mr du Plessis has this hearing not</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a>3A commenced?/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a>176</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a>commenced?  The section makes it quite explicit that you can'trely on any confidentiality once the hearing has commenced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman we say that the referenceto hearing here, if an applicant comes with one application inrespect of one deed that would be the hearing.  We say that oneshould apply that interpretation to each and every applicationthat is made in respect of each and every deed.  We say that theintention was clearly that interested parties would have the opportunityto hear the evidence and then cross-examine, and that the intentionwas not that documents be disclosed to interested parties a weekor perhaps longer before in respect of certain incidents so asto enable everybody to prepare severe cross-examination.  Butwe are in your hands, if that is not the correct interpretationI accept it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> There's no question of a week before, itis when the hearing commences.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes Mr Chairman I understand that thesection says when the hearing commences, the only question isif that refers to a hearing that's held simultaneously such asthis one or if that refers to a hearing of each and every specificapplication pertaining to each and every deed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But you have commenced the hearing of allof them as you have just conceded by calling evidence which appliesto all the hearings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> I have, I must concede that, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Is the position that counsel for a particularclient would be entitled to the entire record or documents relatingto each applicant, or is your view that he'd be</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a>3A only/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a>177</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a>only entitled to that portion of the record or documents whichrelate to his client or clients?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes Mr Chairman obviously that is ourview.  He is only entitled to those incidents which relate tohis clients.  We also say that the method that should be utilisedin providing the copies is that the bundles should not be providedto the legal representatives so that they can make copies of themselves,the specific incidents should be copied by my learned friend andthen provided to them, so as not to disclose other informationabout other incidents not concerning the specific representatives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> That's how it should be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But what would prevent them, the one givingto the other and they make copies of the whole bundle in the longrun.  We are not engaged in a legal battle here, we are involvedin an investigation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, yes that's why we don't have a problemMr Chairman.  We are simply concerned, and one of our major concernsis the Press.  It is possible that if such applications are madeavailable that it could be leaked to the Press.  We don't knowwhat implications that would have.  As long as it doesn't influenceour right to amnesty we won't have a problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> From what I have read in the Press statementswere leaked to the Press by the applicant's attorney last week.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman no statements have been leakedto the Press by the applicant's attorney relating to any informationpertaining to the applications themselves.  Certain informationwas apparently leaked, we don't know how.  We are simply concernedabout that if the availability 3A of/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a>178</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a>of the documents to legal representatives on the basis that itis not disclosed to the Press, on the basis for them to preparecross-examination and on the basis that the applicants won't foregotheir right to amnesty, if the Commission makes that decisionwe won't have any problem with that.  That's why I am not strenuouslyopposing the situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Well Mr Curren you've realised how the basison which this application is being opposed.  The emphasis seemsto be on the word strenuously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR CURREN:</span> Not strenuously.  We hear that Mr Chairman,and our position is simply that any documents given to us whichare in advance of evidence being led will be held by us.  We arecertainly not going to make copies and distribute them to anyone. We have given undertakings to that effect already.  Quite franklyI think we should dispose of this and let's proceed with the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman we accept that undertakingand I will leave the matter there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Very well.  We may proceed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Colonel Venter could you please turn topage 3 of your application and then briefly tell the Committeewhat your background is, the background to your career.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> In 1965 I matriculated at the high schoolPiet Potgieter and I then went to the SAP College for trainingof six months.  I was then transferred to the SAP Bramley.  SinceMarch 1968 I was with the security branch, initially in Johannesburg. During this period I also performed border duty on three differentoccasions in the then Rhodesia.  I was then stationed at the securitybranch at John Vorster Square in Johannesburg until 1969 afterwhich I went to Katimo Mulalo.  In 1971, 1972 I performed clandestinework in Pretoria whilst I was with the security headquarters. 1979 to 1983 I was attached to the security branch Rustenberg,after which I went to Thabazimbi.  In 1983 I was transferred toZeerust.  1 December 1984 I was transferred to the security branchheadquarters where I worked for unit C1 under the command of ColonelCronje, until August 1985.  Then I was transferred to C2 headquarters,security headquarters, and there I stayed until 1990 and I wasthen transferred to the security branch Northern Transvaal until1st of March 1995.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> I would like you to comment on one ortwo aspects which Brigadier Cronje testified about, could youplease comment on the San Hedrun, if you could perhaps just addto what Brigadier Cronje said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> The San Hedrun worked as follows.  Each</p>

<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a>180 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a>security branch in the country, as far as incidents in their particularareas, they reported on this on a daily basis to the regionaloffice, upon which the regional offices conveyed this to headquartersby fax or telex or cryptogram and it was then conveyed to therelevant desk as well as to the staff of the Commissioner.  Theinformation was processed and on a daily basis conferences wereheld regarding the incidents of the previous day and contributionswere then made by the various commanding officers of the variousdesks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you.  Is there anything you wouldlike to add in respect of TREVETS?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could you just tell us please C1, whichunit was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> C1 was the unit which operated from Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And C2?</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> C2 was the unit which operated from headquartersand they were concerned with interrogations of arrested terroristsand the like.  I may add that C3 was TREVETS, as previously mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> As far as TREVETS is concerned could youadd anything to what Brigadier Cronje said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> I may just mention that the headquarter componentof TREVETS consisted of security branch members under the commandof a security branch member and there was also a member of militaryintelligence, as well as a member of national intelligence.  Thesemembers were permanently seconded and they worked with the securitybranch people.  On a monthly basis meetings were held in the variousregions with the regions' representatives involved in investigatingacts of terrorism.  At these meetings targets were</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a>3A identified/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a>181 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a>identified and prominent people involved, initially only abroadbut later also within the borders of the country.  We compileda list of names of these people so that we could have a prioritylist regarding their activities and involvement, internally aswell as outside the borders of the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Colonel.  One further aspect,can you add anything about the destruction of documents?  Youdeal with that on page 20.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Excuse me, can I, before proceeding to that,could you please just explain to us what was contained in thepriority list, what kind of information was contained in thatlist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> The priority list contained targets and thisdealt with installations in other countries which was used asa basis from where people infiltrated the country, MK members. Internally what was involved was places of safety and transithouses where activists and trained terrorists were sheltered andwhere prospective candidates who were about to go for trainingwere accommodated or were in transit to the various points oftraining.  The priority lists were kept on the basis of informationobtained and these contained the names of the people who weremost active at the time whether inside or outside the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Now Colonel could you please ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What were they priority for, what was intendedto be done to these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Chairperson that is where the role of specialforces was involved as has been said here, there were actionsoutside the country as well as inside the country</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a>3A and/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a>182 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a>and that information was collected for that purpose and for actionslike those.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What sort of actions against these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> I am not aware of what type of attacks thesewere but there were attacks on houses and internally on residencesof activists and that is the type of information which was collectedat these monthly meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But you talked about lists of people, nothouses, you talked a moment ago that lists of people were drawnup.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> That is correct.  If I say that houses wereattacked then it would be the houses belonging to the people whosenames were on the list, or where they lived.  There was a targetanalysis which was done regarding these houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So there would be no personal attacks againstpeople, there were attacks against houses and buildings, are yousaying there were no attacks against people?  That this list wasnot for the extermination of people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> No Chairperson.  I think you have misunderstoodme.  The two lists operated jointly.  If a person's name was onthe list and he was identified as a target then necessarily theplace where he lived or stayed would be investigated and analysedso that it could be attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> No attacks against people, I repeat thequestion, is that what you are telling us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> No, no Mr Chairman.  Attacks were directedat people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> But when the list was put up, of these people,was it put up for the purpose of launching attacks</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a>3A on/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a>183 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a>on them?  I am not talking about the buildings, I am talking aboutthe individual people on the list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> That is what I am trying to say.  The listwas compiled containing the names of people. Those people wereabout to be attacked.  But the person necessarily has to stayin a particular house, so the house was targeted, the addresshad to be investigated to determine whether the person was stillstaying there otherwise we would be attacking houses to no avail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You are saying that that is what you aretrying to say, but it is difficult for us to understand you likethat.  Are you aware that to qualify for amnesty you will haveto make a full disclosure of everything that you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Chairperson that's why I am saying I thinkyou misunderstood me.  I said right from the outset that we compileda list of targets and a list persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Yes but you didn't tell us for what purpose,the purpose was never mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> I don't want to mislead the Commission becauseI was still going to get to the purpose of these monthly meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> But my colleague struggled to get an answerfrom you as to the objective and the purpose of these lists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Chairperson I am sorry if I gave that impressionbut it's not my purpose to mislead you in any way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Colonel did the list not contain informationof names of people to be attacked in a particular order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> The most active people were right at thetop of the list.  I could perhaps just mention if a person for</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a>3B instance/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a>184 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>instance was in Botswana and he was planning to go to Angola ina month's time then the name would change to a different placein the order because he wouldn't be as easily accessible if youknow what I mean.  So it was indeed a priority list of the mostimportant people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And that would be for purposes of launchingan attack against that particular person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Colonel you don'thave to sit so close to the microphone.  As far as these objectiveswere concerned was a distinction made between people who had tobe intimidated by for instance a bomb attack at his house or peoplewho had to be eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> I am not understanding this question becausethe way I understand a bomb attack that is also a process of eliminationat the same time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> If I may put it this way was there a listof persons who were to be intimidated by means of damaging theirproperty just to frighten them, and a different list where thepriority was to actually eliminate those people by killing them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> No there was only one list.  There weren'tvarious lists of people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> In that case Colonel who decided on howattacks were to be executed against the people who were in thepriority list?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> All I can tell you is that that is why thespecial forces attended our meetings as well as people from militaryintelligence if these targets were outside the borders of thecountry then it would have been referred to them, and if it wasinternal then a particular region where</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a>3B that/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a>185 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a>that person was located would be responsible for action.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And who in that particular region in termsof rank would determine the manner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> An attack on a person would be planned bythe regional commander because these regional commanders alsoattended the monthly meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Colonel Venter if the objective was determinedby TREVETS and an attack was launched but there was nobody insidethe home, would the person still have remained on the list orwould he have been taken off the list?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> He would have stayed on the list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Could we turn to page 20, the destructionof documents, could you just add anything to Brigadier Cronje'sevidence perhaps?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Documents were destroyed on a regular basisby the security branch.  Shortly before the new government cameto power Head Office gave a telephonic order, I can't rememberwho issued the order, but I suspect that it was via the intelligencesection.  I might just add that in that period General Le Rouxwas the commanding officer of the security branch and the instructionwas that all documents which could implicate and hurt the securitybranch and informer's files in which people's identities couldbe revealed should be destroyed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> You are personally aware of this order?</p>

It was for me quite a bridge to cross to becomepart of the security police when I became involved in them becausetheir actions often flew in the face of the education which Ireceived and were not in line with my Christian principles, butit was necessary due to the circumstances which prevailed at thetime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Colonel Venter then lastly before we cometo the specific events you heard Brigadier Cronje's evidence regardingthe general orders which were given especially during the periodof unrest and riots, do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Would you turn to page 105.  Mr Chairmanthere is just one point I want to raise here, no application wasmade for murder.  We don't believe that there is a case for murderbut we would wish to include, on page 105 with a list of deeds,we would wish to make application to include murder there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Will there be any details about who the victimwould be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> No there won't be, that is why it wasn'tincluded, I just want to make 100% sure please Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a>187 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr du Plessis possibly at this stage Ishould indicate to you that you want to include amnesty for murder,we cannot in general give amnesty for murder.  It might be thathe had murdered a person X who had nothing to do whatsoever withpolitics, it might have been one of his family members or whatever. We cannot offer a general amnesty, only if we know exactly whothe victim was, where the event occurred, the incident occurred,etc.  It is not possible to give amnesty in a sort of broad sensethat he might have murdered his wife or his child, I am not talkingabout your particular case here Colonel Venter but just for exampleand that a person would therefore gain amnesty for murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> I understand that Chair.  Of course thatis one of the problems of the Act, it creates problems that'swhy our approach had been with the drafting of the applicationsthat we would rather put in too much rather than too little. So for instance if we ask for amnesty with regard to murder relatingto a particular case and the Committee believes that the factsdon't justify it and we do not gain amnesty on that case, thenthat is that.  We simply tried to make the applications as wideand as detailed as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman may I just interrupt on what mylearned friend has just requested to do.  If matter is includedin this application and the Committee allows it, then I am goingto have a problem in that on the facts outlined by the applicantno mention is made of murder whatsoever.  Now that is going toimpact itself on the full disclosure.  If it was left out by mistakethen at least the 3B evidence/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a>188 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a>evidence of the applicant from the application itself should revealthat there was murder, but so far there isn't.  Now if it is allowedit will boil down to what the learned Committee member has saidthat it cannot be murder on a global basis without specifics,we don't have specifics of murder in his application.  I've gota problem with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I am going to allow him to include the term"murder".  Should the evidence develop and events unfoldand there might be evidence that might emerge, not from him butfrom others, that might implicate him in murder he would havean opportunity of giving evidence and at that stage we will reviewthe proceedings as to who the victims were and whether we shouldbe able to get hold of the victims and so on but I don't thinkat this stage that it is visualised that they are in a positionto say that in fact he has committed murder and therefore thisapplication is made on that basis.  So I think we will just allowit for the time being.  We will see how the evidence unfolds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> As it pleases the Chair, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you very much Mr Chairman.  ColonelVenter your version of the events referred to as the Pepco 3 incidenthas been detailed in your application, could you read this tothe Commission starting from page 6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> During this event Colonel Jack Cronje wasthe commander at Vlakplaas.  I was directly under his commandand control.  A number of members of Vlakplaas were given theinstruction to go to the Eastern Cape particularly Port Elizabethsince the politically related unrest was taking place there andour help was needed with the suppression of the unrest.  We wereinstructed to take along a group of askaris, former members ofUmkhonto we Sizwe and SAP members 3B to/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a>189 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a>to identify possible infiltrators.  When we as members of Vlakplaaswere sent to other regions we were placed under the command ofthe regional commander and received direct instructions from theregions' offices.  I remember that the following Vlakplaas memberswent along, namely Gert Beslaar, Joe Mamasela, Johannes Kule,Piet Mogwayo, Peggy Radebe and other Black members whose namesI no longer remember.  In the early hours of the morning we arrivedin Port Elizabeth and went to the railway station to Glen Connorwhere we stayed in a house.  We rode patrol and I attempted toidentify possible infiltrators, activists and incitists to findthem and gain information.  As we found and arrested these activistswe handed them over to the local security branch for further action. There were daily consultations with the members of the Port Elizabethsecurity branch.  The purpose was to assist the security branchthere with the finding of trained terrorists and activists whowere fleeing from them and who were responsible for the unrestin the area.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a> The security branch in Port Elizabeth gained information thatthree activists who were specifically looked for with regard topolitical unrest and destabilisation in the area would have goneto the airport that particular night.  At that time the entirecountry was alight and there was unrest everywhere, arson, sabotage,incitement, school boycotts, consumer boycotts, necklacing murdersand other kinds of intimidation.  I was asked to go along withthe askaris to the airport to pick up the three men.  We werenot known in the area and therefore were able to act with easewithout causing suspicion.  Captain Sakkie van Zyl of the securitybranch came along with me and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a>3B askaris/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a>190 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a>askaris.  The information available to us were that they wereANC activists involved in unrest in that area.  The purpose ofthe operation was to interrogate them, gain information, removethem out of the area and neutralise their involvement.  I didnot know at that time that there had been a decision that theywere to be eliminated by being killed.  We drove to the airportwith a Nissan Safari.  Joe Mamasela, Kule, Magwayo and Radebefollowed in a minibus.  Lieutenant Dion Nieuwoudt also went along. I think at that time he was a warrant officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a> We were shown photographs of the activists and knew exactly whatthey looked like.  The askaris easily picked them up at the airportand took them away with a combi to the agreed meeting place alongthe ocean.  Dion Nieuwoudt and another person, whose name I cannotremember removed the vehicle of the three persons, it was a bakkie. Myself, Sakkie van Zyl and Gert Beslaar met the group of askarisat a later stage at the agreed place next to the ocean.  The threeactivists were at this meeting.  They had caps over their headswhich were entirely covered.  Myself and Warrant Officer Beslaarleft everyone there and went back to our residence at Glen Connor. It had been requested that my askaris were to assist the branchwith regard to further interrogation and investigation and I leftthem there under the command of Sakkie van Zyl.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a> Sakkie van Zyl before we left asked me to return to them, orrather to meet with them in Cradock a day or two later.  I donot remember why the interrogation took place at Cradock but acceptedthat the purpose was that they were to be kept outside of thearea where they operated.  I was going to Cradock in any eventsince I was visiting all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a>3B security/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a>191 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a>security branches in the area.  The commander at Cradock was totake me to Van Zyl where I was also to meet with my askaris andregain command over them.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a> A day or two later we went to Cradock where Major Winter, thecommander of the Cradock security branch took us to the placewhere the three captives were.  It was an old police station inthe Cradock area.  I will not be able to identify this place againtoday.  At this old police station was present Sakkie van Zyl,Dion Nieuwoudt, the already mentioned askaris and Major Winterwho took us to this place.  Gert Beslaar had gone along with me. I cannot remember the names of other persons there present. The only persons whom I know and remember at that event was DionNieuwoudt, Sakkie van Zyl and Major Winter.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a> We had a barbecue and had some drinks and the three captiveswere with us but their faces were covered so they were not ableto see us.  I could see them and it had not appeared if they werein any way harmed, or in an evident way harmed. Dion Nieuwoudtor Sakkie van Zyl told me that the investigation or interrogationhad gone well and that much information had been gained.  I didnot take part in the interrogations but gathered that the threewere later to be eliminated since their bakkie had already beendestroyed.   Later that evening I went along with Beslaar backto Glen Connor and the Vlakplaas askaris joined us that eveningor the next morning at Glen Connor.  I was not involved in theinterrogation of the three persons nor was I involved in any assaultsor intimidation or any other action against these three persons. I was also not involved in the removal of the bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a> I am not entirely sure what happened to these three </p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a>3B persons/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a>192 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a>persons nor did I hear afterwards what had happened to them. Someone whose name I cannot remember informed me that their bakkiehad been burnt out.  This is the same bakkie that Nieuwoudt hadremoved from the airport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a> The three mentioned activists were the great troublemakers atthat stage in the Eastern Cape.  The entire operation was aimedat removing these three from the area and to neutralise them. I do not remember that an instruction had been given that theywere to be killed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a> I do, however, know that from time to time that activists andterrorists responsible for serious crimes, the death of otherpersons, assaults, intimidation and the death of innocent civilianswere eliminated and then disappeared.  It was necessary to eliminateactivists of such stature since if they were to be kept in detentionthey would have become an increasing risk since they would havemartyrs for their people.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a> Sakkie van Zyl, then a captain of the security branch in theEastern Cape was under the direct command of the currently retiredGeneral Nick van Rensburg.  Sakkie van Zyl's instructions musthave come from General Nick van Rensburg who was at that timeeither a Brigadier or Colonel and who was then head of the securitybranch in the Eastern Cape.</p>

<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> On page 114 you discussed the politicalpurposes.  The first part of this response is the general partwhich Brigadier Cronje already presented to the Committee.  MayI take you therefore to page 121 starting from the middle of thepage you start with "Die motief was..." could you startfrom there again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> The motive was in every case to gain informationfrom supporters and members of the liberation movements in thestruggle of the State against such movements.  The context inwhich this happened was against the background of increasing destabilisingactions in the country, unrest, violence and intimidation whichhappened on a daily basis.  The ANC attempted to make the countryungovernable and at that stage this was part of the politicalresistance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Then on page 122 right from the top.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> The purpose and goal was to identify ANCsupporters, activists, fellow travellers or terrorists, to gaininformation with regard to them and to have criminal prosecution. The act was necessary to intimidate the terrorists, activistsand their supporters which was necessary in view of the securitysituation in the country.  Action against activists as far asI know was in most cases successful, and of the activists againstactions were taken then no longer continued with their activities. Steps were therefore successful against the activists and inthis way diminished the intimidation and the ungovernability making</p>

<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Chair the means of interrogation which theyused I don't know because I had not been present during the interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You in your statement at page 122 say "normallythe manner of...(Interpretation of the Afrikaans not given)",how can you now say that you don't know, know what the methodswere?</p>

The normal wayof interrogation by security branch members would have been touse violence, to humiliate people, to assault people, to intimidatepeople as a means of gaining information from them.</p>

<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Chair where I was in command of interrogationI normally determined the modus operandi by simply takingpart in the interrogation.

<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Colonel Ventera last question, I just want to clarify this point that we haveagreement with this, under whose instruction were you acting inPort Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Chair I was under the command of the regionalcommander.  I particularly cooperated and received my direct instructionsfrom Captain van Zyl who at that time was my superior.</p>

<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Mr Chairman yes, but at a later stage.  Thereare certain arrangements - my learned friend contacted me in respectof one person, Mr Tebedi who is the speaker of the North WestParliament who has to be back tomorrow and he requested that mylearned friend asked me if we could deal with that incident perhapsafter this incident, with your permission obviously.  We do nothave any problem with dealing with different incidents at differenttimes with different witnesses.</p>

<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a>arrangement my learned friend is referring to contradicts thearrangement that I have made that we are going to travel in thisfashion for various reasons Mr Chairman.  The first reason isthat we felt that we must first deal with the Pepco matter inorder to release the people from Port Elizabeth Mr Chairman. So if we continue now with schedule 9 involving the handgrenadesit means they will have to be detained here and they may misstheir flight.  That's the first reason.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a> The second reason is that I have in attendance the speaker ofParliament from Northwest Mr Chairman who has been with us sinceyesterday and who couldn't come on yesterday and I requested himto be in today and he indicated that he must finish today becauseParliament started today and he had to be back tomorrow.  So Imade that special request that when we finished with the Pepco3, when the point is where people leave then we could call himin and do his matter so that he can also be released, but withthe permission and consent of the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Very well.  Let's proceed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Chair I can't answer this question, I wassimply asked to make my people available at the airport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a>They had the information that these persons would have been atthe airport.</p>

<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Mr Venter you said your task included tracinginsurgents, activists and instigators, and once arrested to handthem over to the local Special Branch, do you still stand by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> I remain with this statement because therewere persons of the Branch present with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Why is it that the three were not merely arrestedand handed over to the local security branch as they qualifiedunder the description of activists and instigators?  Why werethey to be taken to the ocean or beach?</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Chair if I think back to this today, it'sthat these people were taken away from the airport, then theywere handed over to the security branch members.  We did thisnext to the ocean and they then took them away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> You do know the Port Elizabeth Airport Hertzog,when you were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> I do know the Port Elizabeth airport, thatwas in fact the last time I had been to the airport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> It's not a big airport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> No it is very small.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> You said that you and some askaris went toPE Airport because you were unknown in the area it would thusbe able to operate easily, are you therefore to concede that oncethe three were within the airport premises in their motor vehicle,it would have been easy for the local security branch just toclose both the entrance and exits and arrest them inside theircar, they didn't have to come all the way from Vlakplaas to dothat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Chair, I think there's a misunderstanding. I was unknown in the area, as a person I was unknown in the</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a>4A area/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a>200 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a>area.  If I were to take these persons away from the airports,then they could not link this to known security police officersfrom Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> You said you were accompanied by one Dion Nieuwoudt,where was he coming from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Dion Nieuwoudt was of the security branchat Port Elizabeth, also Sakkie van Zyl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Why is it then that you and the askaris wereunknown had to be accompanied by people who were known from thatarea? It doesn't make sense to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> They took us to the airport, let me explainexactly how this worked.  We were sitting in a vehicle to theside, myself and van Zyl, the askaris on their own then approachedthe bakkie when it already had stopped, they then grabbed thesepersons, I was not physically with them, I was at a distance inthe presence of van Zyl and Nieuhoudt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Is that the full name of this Dion Nieuhoudt,is it Dion Nieuhoudt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> That's the only way in which I know him. I know him as Dion Nieuhoudt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Is it the same person who was involved in theMotherwell trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Correct Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> That person is Gideon Nieuhoudt, not Dion Nieuhoudt. That's why I asked that question, I wanted to be sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Mr Chair, no that's correct, I think youcall him Dion which is probably derived from Gideon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Why did you have to go to the coast insteadof to a local police station to interrogate them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a>4A COL VENTER:/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a>201 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Mr Chair, I've already said they gave meinstructions that we would find the askaris at the sea and thatthey would then remove them from there. It was a method whichwas used if they did not want to keep a person at a police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> You said their heads were covered at nightand were not known, why did you have to cover their heads? Whydid you have to cover their heads, you were not known by them,what was the necessity for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> I think it was probably for the other membersof the security branch from Port Elizabeth who were with us. Because they definitely didn't know us.  When I met them nextto the ocean, they were wearing these hats, and when I left shortlythereafter, their heads were still covered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> When did you go to Cradock after the airportincident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> About a day or two later. I can't exactlyremember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Was it the intention of the group to interrogatethem outside the normal Cradock police station, if you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> I would imagine so that that was the intention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Was the police commander, of the Cradock policestation aware that you were in an unused police station of Cradock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> I don't know whether the station commanderof Cradock was aware of this.  I simply don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Why did you not take them to the Cradock policestation and interrogate them there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Chair as I have already indicated, my taskwas to see to it that these people were brought to the ocean,</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a>4A from/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a>202 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a>from there they were taken to a police station close to Cradock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Did you see anyone at any stage assaultingany of those three during the Cradock visit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Is that at the old police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> During my visit there they were not assaultedin my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Did you hear any shots been fired on any ofthem by any of the group of the police at that police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> No Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> You say that you were not involved in any interrogation,assaults, intimidation or any other action against the three orthe removal of their vehicle, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Correct Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> The million dollar puzzlement that I have iswhy were you then involved at all in this matter, being at theairport, coast or beach and then at Cradock, if you had businessregarding them?  And coming all the way from Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Chair it was my instruction to go to PortElizabeth.  Once I arrived there I was given the instruction tohelp with the identification and tracking of trained MK's andactivists who were being looked for.  I was asked or instructedto make available my askaris to take these persons at the airport.I think that they used this opportunity to use persons unknownin the area.  That was the end of my task, simply to take themat the airport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> As an experienced policeman did that not strikeyou as odd that you had no duty whatsoever in this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> No Chair, this was after all their area,they</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a>4A knew/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a>203 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a>knew what they wanted to do with the persons, why they would interrogatethem.  They dealt with the entire thing. I had other tasks tocontinue to try and track down other persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Can I just clarify something that I'm a littleconfused about.  Who did you go to the airport with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Sakkie van Zyl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> In what sort of vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> The person who worked with me, Gert Besselaarwas also with me, my apologies.  It was a Nissan Safari, that'sthe kind of vehicle which they used at that time. It was my ownvehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> How did the askaris travel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> They used a combi, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Who else went?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Dion Nieuhoudt.  I cannot remember how hegot there.  I think there was another vehicle involved with alsosome of their other staff?  There had been another person therewith me but he removed the bakkie afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You see in your statement you say Joe Mamasela,Kula Magaye and Gadeba followed with the minibus?  Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So there was a party consisting of - wheredo Mamasela, Kula and Gadeba come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> As I said, they came down with me, not inmy vehicle, but in the minibus, in the combi, to the airport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Are they from Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So there were the four of you from Vlakplaas,your askaris and you all went to the airport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Chair, no. There were four askaris, myselfand 4A Gert/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a>204 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a>Gert Besselaar who came from Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Where did Mamasela, Kula Makaya and Gadebacome from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> The are the askaris.  Let me explain it toyou. Joe Mamasela is an askari, Piet Magwaya is an askari, PIekieGadebe, I think he's an askari, Nkhule was a member of the policeforce, who also came along from Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So three askaris.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> May I continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I notice in your applicationfor amnesty that you are also including malicious injury to property,what did that relate to?  Does it relate to the burnt van of oneof the three?</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Did you know that the vehicle used by the threewas going to be used before it was destroyed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> No, I only learned of that later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Then why is it that you are applying for amnestyfor something that you did not know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> I only heard later that the vehicle had beendestroyed, whilst I was still in PE, I learned that the vehiclehad been destroyed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> But before you left for the airport, you neverknew that there was a vehicle that was going to be destroyed,so that excuses you from any legal liability.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Mr Venter let me move on, if you were in fact,a bystander and did not commit any offence, how is it that youare asking for amnesty regarding other minor offences or thoserelating from the facts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a>4A COL VENTER:/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a>205 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> I was involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman may I please interrupt here.The listing of the specific criminal acts which have been setout in the schedules of all the applicants, were done on legaladvice. The applicants are policemen, they are not legal specialists,they don't know what the elements of specific crimes are, andon that basis I think it is unfair to cross-examine the witnesson what reason these criminal acts were included.  As I've indicatedbefore, it was done on the widest ambit possible and it is notto be regarded as an admission of being guilty of perpetratingnecessarily all these acts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does that meet your requirements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Can I ask a question.  So your lawyer did nottell you the legal implication of including those four factors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think at this stage any purposeis served as to what part these lawyers are concerned with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Alright, I'll move on.  You are said that youwere not aware of exactly what happened to the three, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Why did you not ask the askaris who joinedyou that evening or the following day as to what had happenedto those three that were being interrogated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> The askaris reported to me and they didn'ttell me what had happened to the people.  To this day I don'tknow how they were killed, whether they were killed and wherethe corpses were or are. I can't answer that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> The question was why didn't you ask them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> I didn't ask them because their work hadbeen</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a>4A completed/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a>206 COL VENTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a>completed.  I didn't believe that they were further involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> They were people subject to your authority,you were in command of them, you had brought them down there,you had sent them off on an operation, and you didn't think itwas your duty to find out what had happened?  Is that what you'retelling us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> No, I asked them whether they completed theirtask, whether the job was done and they said, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> It seems that you were avoiding findingout, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> What is meant by whether the job is done, whatjob did you think was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Initially we went along to help with theinterrogation.  I later suspected that these people had been eliminatedbut the reason why I didn't ask them was that I didn't believethat they were involved in the process of  elimination. I didn'tthink that they were present and that's why I didn't ask them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did you have no sense of responsibility foryour askaris?</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> The last persons who were with these threewere the police, according to you, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Is it not reasonable to conclude that the questionsthat must be asked as to their whereabouts are the police datingfrom 1985, would you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Were you aware that the then Minister of Lawand Order, Mr Louis Le Grange, paid a brief visit to Port</p>

<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a>207 COL VENTER</p>

<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Were you in Port Elizabeth the day before thedisappearance of the three?</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Mr Chairman, I would like to hand in copiesof a newspaper report indicating that Le Grange was in Port Elizabethto visit African townships at Port Elizabeth.  They are very briefreports Your Worship.  This strikes me as a strange coincidencethat here is a delegation from Vlakplaas and here is the Ministerof Law and Order, and soon there is the disappearance of highprofile politicians. Does that not strike you as odd or a coincidence,Mr Venter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> It's the first time that I've heard thisand it might seem coincidental, but I was not aware that he wasin Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Even if you did not know about that then, butnow, is that not a coincidence according to your sense?</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> That's what I'm saying, yes it does seemcoincidental that it happened that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> The City Press of the 4th of December 1994quotes a Sergeant X who made three statements regarding the Cradockincident and I will be very brief with you.  He says that it saysthat the three were enticed to the airport by a telephone callto meet a British diplomat.  Your Worship I would like to handin just two pages.  That they were to meet a British diplomat,this is on page three.  He further stated that they were drivenfrom the PE airport, straight to Cradock that very night and interrogatedand assaulted with knobkierries and pistol butts, and that othersheld a</p>

<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a>braai and drank beer outside, what do you say about these twoincidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> I've already said that I don't know exactlyhow they operated and what they did, but they were probably enticedto go to the airport, I'm however saying to you that from theairport they were taken to a beach somewhere and from there theydisappeared, I cannot comment on what happened, because I wasn'tpresent after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Finally he further says that two of them diedthat very night. The first to die was Mr Hashe who was hit onthe head with a pick handle and collapsed.  The second one todie was Mr Godolozwa, who was shot in the head.  The third one,Mr Galela was saved because he said he was an informer and theyhad to get verification of that the following day. As a result,there was no verification, he was shot the following day.

<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> What is the question, is it, would I knowthese people, or whether they were present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MS HARTEL:</span> Would these officers have been aware of thearrest and detention of the Pepco Three?</p>

<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> He was aware because he took me to the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You have testified or explained what you meantby neutralised to the effect that it's to take a person out ofa place to another place. Now my question is to you, for how longwould that person be kept there?</p>

<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Do I then understand you to be saying that you'dtake this person out of his area to neutralise him and when</p>

<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a>you're through with him you didn't care whether he came back immediatelythe following day after two or three hours, is that what you mean? Would that still be neutralisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> No you're misunderstanding me. In the hypotheticcase where I removed somebody, or are you specifically referringto the Pepco Three?</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> The Pepco Three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> No in the case of the Pepco Three I don'tknow how long it would have been, I had to remove them from theairport and take them to the beach.  I had nothing to do withthe interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> I'm not on the questioning of the Pepco Three. You explained what you meant or you understood by 'to neutralise'.Now my question was to you, if to neutralise means taking themout of their area to another area, for how long were they supposedto be in that other area?  Or were they to remain there up tillwhat happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> That's very difficult to answer. It all dependedon the cooperation that I was given, information obtained andthe circumstances.  I can't actually fix a particular period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> If you received no cooperation and receivedno information, what would the position be then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> If I received no cooperation, I would detainhim and continue to interrogate him, indefinitely.

<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a>interrogate, gain information, remove them from the area and neutralisethem, what do you mean when you say 'you were not supposed tointerrogate him'?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> If it was my task to interrogate them I removethem or cause them to be removed and I was not allowed to be presentduring the interrogation, so I had nothing to do with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Were you given instructions not to participatein the interrogation, is that what you are telling us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> They took them away from the beach and Iwent back, so I didn't have the opportunity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> But say you were part of this operation,you were taken all the way from Vlakplaas, there were seven membersof that unit to participate in this operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> I think we were used for this operation toget the people to the airport.  I think that was our sole purpose,and for the rest it was up to them to continue with the three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But they were, you've told us, as I understandyour evidence, please correct me, that when these people arrivedat the airport they were grabbed by your askaris and put intoa vehicle, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So anybody could have done that whetherthey were known to them or not known to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> I can't answer that.  They asked me to helpthem.  They told me that we were unfamiliar to them and I thereforeconcluded that they were enticed to go to the airport by meansof a phone call.  That's the only explanation I can give.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And if familiar people from Port Elizabethor the area were used they would have recognised them and somebodywould then have been able to say we saw yesterday that SergeantX had taken him away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Mr Venter before you left for Vlakplaas didn'tyou discuss this whole operation with the people of the securityin Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> No.  The last time I saw Dion Nieuwoudt andSakkie van Zyl was at the old police station.  I didn't see themagain after that.  I couldn't discuss it with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Colonel do you want us to believe that afterthe operation or after handing them over you left without beingtold by your colleagues in Port Elizabeth what is going to happento them?  Do you want us to believe that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> That is correct.  Because as I said I didn'tsee Sakkie van Zyl and Dion Nieuwoudt again in the time that Iwas there.  We continued with our other duties and I didn't seethem again.  I can't remember how long a period of time elapsed,I just didn't see them again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Venter you were given instructions byyour commander in Vlakplaas to go and assist in this operation,when you came back what kind of a report did you give to yourcommander with regard to how these orders were executed by youas a leader of the six other Vlakplaas members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> It was our custom upon arrival to reportto our commanding officer, not in full detail on all the minorthings.  I gave him an oral report.  It wasn't always in writtenform and I told him that everything had proceeded according toplan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did you tell him that you and your askaris</p>

<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a>had been responsible for removing three people from the airportwho had later been liquidated, who you believed had later beenliquidated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> Chairperson I believe that I told him thatmyself and askaris were responsible for the removal of the peoplefrom the airport.  I can't remember whether I ever told him thatit was my view that they had been eliminated.  Maybe he can assistin this respect, but I think I reported to him that the peoplehad been arrested and removed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Surely it was of vital importance thathe should know, that he could take steps to make sure that youraskaris didn't talk about it, let the cat out of the bag, youhad been concerned, indirectly, in three murders, and you didn'tthink to tell your commanding officer.  You may not have you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> (The Interpreters are struggling to hearthe witness).  I don't know whether I actually gave him my opinionon the matter, but it is possible.</p>

I have been burning my seat because of the questions I want toask.  Colonel, there is something which is not very clear to usand it's obvious that everybody in this hall is misunderstandingthe position, for how long were you in Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> I can't remember exactly, it could have beenbetween 14 and 18 days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> And this incident in the planning beforehand,was this ever discussed with you before you went to Port Elizabeth?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> The task of such a group in an area was totrace trained MK members.  The askaris or ex MK members were familiarand knew where the other trained people were and they moved aroundin this area to trace other MK's.  That was our main task.  Ifsome of them could be traced they would be arrested and handedover to the security branch in that area.  Other tasks includedthe identifying of people involved in riots and chaos which existedat the time and to convey that information to the security branchof that particular area, further investigation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you perform these duties during the18 days that you were there?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">COL VENTER:</span> We went to all the various branches in anarea to find out whether there was any way in which we could assistthem because I also at the various branch offices I would forinstance go to Uitenhage and I would deploy my people there andI would visit that particular branch.</p>

I beg your pardon she reminds me that they haveto make their submissions, I forgot about that, I am sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a>MS HARTEL ADDRESSES COMMITTEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a> Mr Chairman, honoured members of the Committee the families ofthe Pepco 3 have some idea of what happened to their loved ones,from revelations outside this Commission which they have beenunable to test.  They know that they were abducted, tortured andmurdered at the hands of the police.  They had hoped, however,to establish today from Venter's submissions and testimony thefiner details of what exactly happened on that day, who the responsibleperpetrators are and most importantly where the bodies are.  The families have brought three applications since the fatefulday when their loved ones disappeared for the police to producethem to the Court.  In every one of those </p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a>4B applications/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a>223 ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a>applications the police vehemently denied that the men were arrestedor detained.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a> The families want only to establish who committed these grossviolations and to find the bodies so that they can give theirloved ones a proper burial and put the matter to rest.  This isafter all the whole purpose of the Truth and Reconciliation Commissionto establish the whole truth so that reconciliation and reconstructioncan be advanced. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a> When an amnesty applicant fails to make a full disclosure ofall relevant facts we submit, with respect, that such applicationmust fail.  Venter's submissions are disappointing to say theleast.  His application for amnesty is limited to acts, omissionsor offences which he describes as abduction, malicious injuryto property, theft, other minor offences associated therewithand any other offences which may appear from his submissions orthe facts to which he has deposed.  He has added murder, but wewould submit, with respect,  that  it doesn't take the matterany further as the facts to which he has deposed does not discloseor make out any case of murder or even an association with murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a> The application is lacking in material detail such as an absencein response to the question, at page 114 of Venter's submissions,in response to the question 10A "Mention political purposes",no response is noted.  It also fails even to identify the Pepco3 as victims and I refer in this regard to page 113 of Venter'ssubmissions, where the response to all the questions regardingwho the victims are, their names and addresses and other informationwhich would assist this Committee in identifying them, the answeris "onbekend" "unknown" "no informationto assist".</p>

<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a>224 ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a> We would submit for this reason alone the application shouldfail for want of proper compliance with the requirements of theAct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a> It is the families' contention further that Venter's applicationfor indemnity is disingenuous as he does not even begin to acknowledgehis complicity in acts which amount to gross violations of humanrights.  In fact Venter has made every effort to disassociatehimself with the crux of the matter which is the death of thePepco 3 activists.  He denies that he had any part in the interrogationof the three or assaulting them or intimidating them.  He evengoes further and denies that they had suffered any injuries whichwere obvious to the eye.  He denies that he has knowledge of anyother acts committed in relation to them.  He has no knowledgeof the fate of the yellow bakkie which conveyed them to the airport. And he bears no personal knowledge of their eventual fate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a> Mr Chair one is at a loss to understand the purpose of his applicationfor indemnity.  Venter has not furnished this Committee with anyinformation in addition to the revelations made by the Vlakplaasoperatives outside of this Commission.  In fact he's not evenassociated himself with the allegations made by these operatives. He has only detracted therefrom. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a> It is inconceivable, given the public knowledge of the Vlakplaas,of the agenda during the period in question, that they would haveinvolved themselves in the affairs of the Eastern Cape in relationto the three for any purpose other than to permanently eliminatethem.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a> I submit further that Venter has failed to assist this Committeein identifying any key perpetrators in respect of </p>

<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a>application which I lodged yesterday with the Committee pertainingto State witnesses ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> No, no apart from that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Apart from that, no, no, it doesn't seemto be that there will be any other witnesses pertaining to thisissue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> So the evidence is closed for this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> No, with respect, we haven't given judgementon the Mamasela case, whether we are granting the applicationor not, so I don't think it's a fair question to put at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> No I mean subject to our ruling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman I want to keep that optionopen because Joe Mamasela was present with this whole operationand he might be able to shed a lot more light on the truth andon the facts of this matter than Colonel Venter was able to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr du Plessis what I am saying is that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> I understand exactly what you are saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And there is no ruling yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> But assuming that the ruling comes to saythat we don't want to subpoena those witnesses there isn't anymore witnesses coming.  We are not going to hear any more witnessesin respect of Pepco 3, I want to understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> The applicants don't intend to call anyfurther witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Well that is my impression, my impressionwas 5A that/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a>230 ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a>that subject to that, the evidence is complete.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.  If the applicants don't want tocall any further witnesses, and the families don't want to callany further witnesses the only other possible witnesses who mightbe able to shed light are the Attorney-General's witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> The Attorney General's witnesses are five,he has named other people hasn't he, who were present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Colonel Venter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Yes, who are not part of the Attorney General'switnesses who are potential witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Who are potential witnesses that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> For anybody who wishes to call them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> For anybody who wishes to call them, forme as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You don't need our permission, the Committeemay call them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.  Mr Chairman I wanted to add now,while I was saying that there is obviously the section in theAct dealing with the hearing, if I can refer you to the specificsection, section 30 which deals with the procedure to be followedat an investigations and hearings, which says that,</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a>  "If during any investigation by or any hearing before theCommission any person is implicated in a manner which may be tohis or her detriment the Commission shall, if such person is available,afford him or her an opportunity to submit representations tothe Commission within a specified time with regard to the matterunder</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a>5A consideration/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a>231 ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a>  consideration or to give evidence at a hearing of the Commission".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a>So it is possible obviously, and that is what I wanted to addto this.  It is possible that the Commission could decide thatcertain of the people named might be offered an opportunity ofpresenting the Commission with representations.  As I understandthat the Commission can decide if it should be written representationsor if it should be representations at a possible further hearing. That is how I interpret the Act.  So I do not want, at this stage,to finally commit myself on saying that everything is closed exceptfor Joe Mamasela.  I cannot do that in the light of this section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Then I have serious problems.  I don't understandwhy I should in the middle of the hearing and of evidence listento anybody's argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman I don't either.  There wasa request that there was argument. Mr Chairman I further justwant to stress one point, and that is that we read section 30as saying that in respect of a person that is implicated in amanner in a hearing which may be to his detriment the Commissionshall afford him an opportunity to submit representations or togive evidence.  We do not read it as the task of the applicantsto subpoena or see that any persons who are implicated are subpoenaedto come and give evidence in support of the applicant's application. I just want to make that point clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> (Inaudible)...is that the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MS HARTEL:</span> That is correct Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> So you can't take this matter any further atthis stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a>5A MS HARTEL/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a>232</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MS HARTEL:</span> No we can't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And you didn't propose calling any witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MS HARTEL:</span> No, those are not our instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Thank you.  You are excused from further attendance. Mr Mpshe can the speaker of the house not be persuaded to comehere tomorrow morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman I have made that attempt but I failed. Perhaps since he's in here if he may be called to the fore andthe request be made by the Committee, but I have already indicatedto him and he said it is not possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Well it is not possible to rush proceedingsjust because it might be temporarily inconvenient.  This isn'tjust another trial, it is a matter of some importance about whichhe is going to give evidence, then obviously there will have tobe proper time for him to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> How long do you estimate his evidence willtake in-chief and cross-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I am estimating it at more than an hour Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Mpshe will that not entail hearing theapplication of both Mr van Vuuren and Mr Hechter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That has been considered but we have agreedthat since the deed was done by two we may just call one of them,that was the agreement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Is he not available the coming week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman with your permission can I approachhim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> The importance of these proceedings and onedoes 5A not/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a>233</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a>not want to hold proceedings in such a rushed manner just becauseit is temporarily inconvenient.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman at this stage while he isspeaking to the speaker may I perhaps just make one point andthat is that in an incident such as this where Warrant Officervan Vuuren and Captain Hechter were both present and their applicationscorrespond very closely to each other Mr Mpshe and I were quiteunsure how to deal with that because if both of them would haveto present their factual evidence to the Committee it would beactually a repetition of the same evidence.  However, I do notwant to prejudice the applicant's applications by calling theone and not calling the other, so I would like a direction fromthe Committee if possible on that issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> The ease with which you ask for directionsfrom the Committee astounds me.  I think that how to conduct yourapplication is something with which you ought to familiarise yourselfwith, and you've got to weigh and balance in the balance justexactly how important it is for you to follow one direction oranother direction.  It is not for us to tell you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, alright Mr Chairman then I will beforced to call both of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr Chairman I have consulted with the victimMr Chairman.  He has indicated to me that he can still be ableto come tomorrow on condition that the matter is started within the morning so that at lunchtime or before lunch he can driveback to Mmbatho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Mpshe will you kindly tell the gentlemanthat we will hear him first if it's not inconvenient to anybodyelse and that will be at 9:30 tomorrow morning.</p>
