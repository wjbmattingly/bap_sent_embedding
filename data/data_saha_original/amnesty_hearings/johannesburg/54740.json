You were asked:  \"So what you said in these statements, these three statements, is the following\n1.  No record was kept in the firearm register.\n2. In your second statement, I have no recollection of details concerning to whom firearms were issued.\n3. If I look at the firearm register, they will not assist me to find out to whom I issued weapons.\"\n\tYour reply was:  \"That is correct.\"\n\tSo you were referred to three different statements you made under three different occasions under oath.\n\tIt then proceeds:  \"And all of that is untrue?\"\n\tYour reply was:  \"Yes.\"\n\tNow just to place the Chairman and Honourable Committee Members in the picture, at that stage the firearm register was presented and from the firearm register it in fact appeared that this witness did write in the names of certain people who he issued firearms to and what firearms he issued to them.  In all three the previous statements that Judge Nugent referred to here - he referred to untruthful statements made by this witness concerning that particular firearm register and this witness then replied when he was referred to the three statements that he made \"and all of that is untrue?\" and his reply was \"Yes.\"  Is that correct Mr Kruser?",

            "That's correct but I would like to say that I think the evidence you're reading from, I think it's important that - it's a pity we can't hear the evidence on tape to show - I think the contempt with which I was treated with by that Judge - that's my personal opinion.\n\tSecondly, I've gone through that process and I even told the Judge on the next morning - if you look for it in my evidence - that I don't completely agree to him when I went there one night - I did not completely agree - I just want to explain the issue of the register itself.  When I did the statement with my lawyers, which I tried to explain to the Judge, I then stated that the names were not recorded in the firearm register.  That was the essence of my statement.  When the books were brought to court it was recorded on another page in the firearm register but not under the normal circumstances which we normally record it because it was a rush morning, I took a page and wrote it.  When I was with my lawyers doing a statement, my recollection at that stage was it was not in the firearm register but I knew I wrote it down somewhere.  The facts when the book was brought, it was in the firearm register but not the normal procedure which we used and that was the debate with me and the Judge at that stage.  After lot's of pressure from the Judge I conceded and I think if that - even if the Committee feels that my interpretation when I was with my lawyers and what happened when the book was brought is wrong or a lie then I concede but I was honestly of the opinion when I made this statement when I sat with my lawyers that I recorded it in a book or on a page at some stage because of the rush of the morning.  It was not written in the normal fashion which we do guns as normal, you could see in the book how we normally would issue guns, there were just names and the gun number, no signatures, all those things that was the rush of the morning and when I did the statement itself my recollection at that stage was, you know sometime and I was busy with other things in my new job in government. We used to come to the lawyers in the evening, we never had the books with us, I recollected that I wrote it down somewhere.  I knew we never followed the proper procedures we normally had to follow and that was my recollection.  The Judge refused to even give me a chance, I mean to explain some of the things, I was just shouted down, but what I'm saying is I concede that is the truth, I wrote it in the firearm register, not in the normal fashion, in some other page, not with all the necessary requirements which is required for me when I hand out guns and that is the facts of the matter.\n\tThe other point is - I deliberately withheld names from the police and attorney and there were very good reasons for that.  I was not prepared to expose my comrades and my colleagues to the mercy of assassination and that's a decision I had to make.  I decided and we decided as a collective, that at some stage in this process when we come to court that we will tell what we know happened and I told the Judge that.  I think my reason under the circumstances of the times when I know other colleagues and comrades of mine were killed in Natal when they testified as witnesses, I was not prepared to expose my colleagues to that.",

The drawing of the final documents which I also tried to explain to the learned Judge was done by the ANC legal team and our legal representatives here.

There's evidence what happened at the Jo'burg Civic Centre when they broke down the doors in that march - so I think it's common cause and I think any trained security person would tell you that you need to determine where you last line of defence is - where you're going to face the minimum of losses when you're under attack.

He deals specifically with this so called information and he makes the finding on a prima facie basis.

Now there can be a big debate of what rumour is and what information is and what intelligence is because I see in his judgement, I haven't read it but, looking at it he says it's quite likely there were rumours of varying reliability.  Now as a person trained in intelligence, a rumour for one person could be information for someone else and intelligence for the next person depends from which source you are getting it and what avenue the information comes to you.  I mean even based on his own findings, if I just read it my own interpretation of it - he says it's quite likely they would be rumours.  Now as an intelligence person as I say a rumour could be information, for the next intelligence officer it could be intelligence because intelligence is confirmed information.  If it's from more than two sources it could be intelligence.  I know I was informed by Commissioner Radu and later in the morning by other intelligence officers in the ANC that there was information to that effect.  Now whether you want to call it a rumour or not it depends who's receiving the information.  I mean even if I read the findings now myself there's a contradiction in terms of this whole thing myself how I interpret it and I don't think I'm a lawyer but that's how I see it as a lay person.\n\tTo go further, I'm just reading, he says, he talks about the state of mind and I don't know whether it matters or whether information or not and whether my apprehension was because of the information or because the activities of the marchers during the day - I don't see - I'm just reading, I haven't read it before but now I had time while you asked the question.  I can't see the difference in apprehension although I know for myself that I got that information from some of my colleagues here sitting behind and from the Commissioner the late Mr Radu and I stand by the fact that I received that information but I find the judgement a bit contradictory itself as a lay person but I'm not a lawyer but I'm sure my lawyers will argue those things if they agree with me.",

In our view the weight of the evidence is wholly against this.  The evidence of both Mr Von Eggerdy and Mr Diaz was that the first sound of gunfire the crowd immediately disintegrated and fled.  We have no reason to doubt this evidence and it is quite inconsistent with the version that the firing was coming from the crowd before the security guards fired.  Mr Von Eggerdy had heard about three shots being fired earlier but that was before the group had yet even converged in the intersection.

One of the documents I wrote to the National Directorate around securing our leaders and other things was we faced a serious concern from right wing and third force elements in the process of doing that and I made a motivation which was rejected by the vast majority of regions in which I was in charge of all the regions which was eventually approved by our director, Mr Joey Ntlhantlha and the essence of my suggestion was that we involve police or state structures in all our security operations.  The reason why I motivated that was I thought that elements of security forces would not attack their own members and that was the basis why I made a motivation to my leadership and throughout the process they set up liaison structures and we thought, although we knew the liaison structures were all security branch structures, we had to use those structures to the best of our ability as an organisation which didn't have the resources of which the state has and I think it worked very effectively for us.  Whenever I needed a sweep - we never had dogs to sweep our bombs, I could phone Captain Wilkins and he would come and bring his dogs in there.  If a bomb went off he would have taken that responsibility, I didn't think he would subject himself to those sort of things.  If President Mandela went to any area we had two security branch policemen in the cars in the convoy, we didn't think they would attack their own members, so it was a strategy which worked very well for us and that is why in all the other events when we call them to assist us - they guarded our building at night previously when we thought there were attacks when we received information.  They had regular patrols there at Shell House, they came to sign our O.B. book on a regular basis every hourly patrols - those things were taking place - we didn't trust them completely - we used what we could from the state structures because we also knew they understood where this country was heading and who would be the future government of the day.\nSo it was trust but we qualified the type of trust which we gave to them.",

His primary responsibility was to ensure that Shell House was secured and that the offices of the provinces were properly secured and all those things.\n\tI had a conversation with him on the Sunday evening, I gave him certain instructions, he came back to me, he was satisfied that he had spoken to the police and they would get protection.

I also - I remember one day, I don't have the dates clearly in my mind - I accompanied my legal people, Caroline, I think Danny Burke was also with us to John Vorster Square to make statements to the police because we were asked by the leadership to go and make statements to start this whole process of co-operation which the president made public.  While making the statements, the officers who were recording added things to our statements which we did not say and our legal representatives objected to them putting things in our statements which we're not saying.  There was a very. very hostile exchange between our legal representatives, ourselves and the police.  Eventually the police advocate had to come into the situation and try to resolve it.  I think it was at this stage that the agreement was then reached by the police advocate that we only had to make statements about the gist of what happened and not specifics.\n\tAdditional to that the request from the ANC was always that this issue should be investigated entirely but if you look at the headings of the letter sent to us by the A.G.'s office it was always \"Eight Accounts of Murder at Shell House\" and that gave us a very clear indication that they were not interested at all in investigating the whole event of the day but taking us as accused from the very beginning of this thing.  You can look at even in hindsight, you can look at it from each and every statement which was made to the police - it was never produced as evidence - until the Judge had to call for it.  I mean there's so many incidents we can record of hostility of the police towards us in the investigation.  They went to my secretary and lied to her to get information saying that I said they must give information.  They came to me telling me other guards had made statements.  These were junior police officers who were in charge of investigating, who were doing these type of things.  I mean, there was just complete hostility during the whole investigation team and our lawyers and the ANC.  Every information we gave them was leaked to the press.  As soon as a statement was put it, you could read it in the newspaper the next day.  I mean, could we trust this sort of investigation, both from the Attorney General and the police?
