<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> In what language are you going to testify Mr Zungu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">PRECIOUS WISEMAN ZUNGU:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR KOOPEDI:</span> May I then proceed Mr Chairperson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Mr Zungu, where do you reside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I reside in Emdeni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now is it correct you are a co-applicant in this matter, the amnesty application for the killing of Sicelo Dhlomo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Is it also correct that this incident happened in January 1988?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now when this incident occurred, were you a member of any political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> What political organisation were you a member of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Sosco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Were you at the same time a member of any underground structures of any political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Were you an underground member of what political structure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now let's get to the deceased, the late Sicelo Dhlomo, did you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes I knew him although not too much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Well there is evidence before this Committee that he resided in Emdeni and was a student activist.  Now were you - in these underground structures that you were involved in, was he also involved in the same structures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now we have evidence that in fact you, him and the other applicant that came before you had belonged to a particular cell or unit as it is commonly known, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now let's go to his death.  Were you involved in his death, were you present when he died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> For the sake of brevity I'm going to try and shorten his evidence with your permission Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>	We have evidence here that in fact when he died you had been fetched by Clive to go to some meeting place, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> And we further have evidence that in fact before he was killed you were not given any explanation, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now because you were a member of this unit that executed or killed Sicelo Dhlomo, do you think that this killing had a political motivation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> What is this political objective that you would obtain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Although I did not have any idea before Sicelo died but I did get the explanation subsequently, that is subsequent to the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now is it on the basis of the political motivation that you seek amnesty from this Honourable Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Other than the brief facts that you have given us, is there anything that you would want to say to this Committee or any persons present in this hall or elsewhere?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> First of all, I would like to thank this opportunity that all this came to the surface about his death and also the fact that I would like my amnesty application to be granted favourable considerations and to the family I would like them to take the past and put it in the back and move on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Chairperson, that's all for now from my side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KOOPEDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I think we have to record a little more than you have.  He has said simply that although he had no information before, he was told subsequently.  I think we ought to at least record were you told by Mr Dube what he said was the reason for killing the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was this what you were told after the deceased had been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes that is true.  The full explanation, I got it after some time because we did not have enough time immediately after this incident but I was informed however the reasons why he had to be killed.  The reason was he was an informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR RICHARD:</span> Mr Zungu, did you know the deceased before he joined your cell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I knew him from school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And which school is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> When we had meetings for instance that's when I will come across him or I will see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So you weren't at school with him but you knew him from meetings at school, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">R RICHARD:</span> And for how long had you known him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I did not know him for quite some time, quite long rather.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> How long is that, is that one month, one year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> You mean before this incident?  Knowing him before this incident or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Before he joined your cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I knew him from merely seeing him, I don't know as to how long, I can't remember in fact the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Weren't you aware of his activities, his activism?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I just knew him as any other comrades at school when we meet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you know he was a volunteer worker at the Detainee's Parents Support Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you know anything about the television programmes, the interviews?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now after he joined the cell, did you become aware of his activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> No, I also had no intentions of knowing that, I had no interest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now so that means you're unaware of the various times and dates that he got arrested, detained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I may say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now did you have any reason to doubt Mr Tshabalala's suggestion that he join the cell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> What suggestion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Mr Tshabalala nominated him and proposed him as a member of your cell and that he joined.  What was your attitude to him joining?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I don't want to prolong any answer to that because I had no knowledge about this man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Maybe the question can be put this way Mr Richard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>	Do you know how it came about that he became a member of your cell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I will say I know because I was told, that that was announced to me that there will be one other member will be joining us and we will be working with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you have any say as to whether he should or shouldn't join?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you mind him joining?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you ever have any suspicions about trustworthiness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> You're referring to which period here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I'm talking about - well take it this way, between when he joined and October, did you have any suspicions about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I will gratefully answer you and say I had no knowledge or any knowledge about Sicelo as such as a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So prior to October you had no reason to suspect that he was an informer, that's your answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I will say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> After October did you have any reason to suspect him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> After October where and what could have happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> After October 1987 or during October 1987 did you have any reason to suspect that the deceased might be an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Were you aware that other persons had suspicions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now so that means it was only after his death that you heard about the suspicions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes except for the time when he disappeared, when I was told by the commander that I must be alert, vigilant, because we did not know his whereabouts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did the commander explain anything more than it was simply his absence that required you to be alert and vigilant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I don't remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Right, now you were present today and you heard Clive Mkubu the third applicant give evidence and his evidence was to the effect that you received a phone call to be on standby and later in the day he came to fetch you?  Do you agree with those statements or dispute that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> It is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when he phoned you did he give you any reasons as to why you were required to be on standby?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> At what time did he arrive at your house later to fetch you that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> It could have been some time in the afternoon although I don't remember the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was it daylight or night time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> It was just towards dusk, it was not very dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Right, now when Mr Mkubu came to fetch you did he explain why you had to go anywhere, what the reasons for the meeting might be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when did you first become aware of the fact that the deceased was to be executed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I did not know that he was going to be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When he was killed did you do anything to try and stop it happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> There was no time for such and nothing occurred in my mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Why did you think it was necessary for you to be there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I don't want to lie and commit myself, I think the commander will be in a better position to give explanation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Were you confused as to why you had been brought there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Were you at any stage ever suspicious of Mr Dube, had doubts about his ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> That's what he did?  What was it that he did that brought me to be suspicious about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you trust Mr Dube?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> As a commander, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you have any doubts about him at any stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What was your opinion of his explanation for killing Mr Dhlomo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Please repeat that question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What was your opinion of his explanations for killing Mr Dhlomo?  Did you believe they were sufficient?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> After he gave us the explanation I held no opinion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So that means you didn't accept the explanation or reject it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I don't want to say that, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Were you ever involved in any other summary executions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Were you ever aware of any other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now you've heard me put various propositions to the last applicant where I outlined that - sorry one last questions before I do that.  You've heard the last applicant, Mr Tshabalala say the deceased joined the cell during August/September, do you agree or disagree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I don't want to lie, I don't want to commit myself to this, I have no recollection of the dates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now while he was a member of the cell did Mr Dhlomo take part in any of the submissions or operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Well the evidence is that he did not, do you disagree with that or you just don't remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Do you think if indeed he was an informer it was necessary to execute him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> During those days it was public knowledge that the informers will be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Do you still think Mr Dhlomo was an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I did say that I bear no knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now from the time that Mr Dhlomo joined the cell to say six months, a year after his death, did anything happen to the cell which might have made him suspect that an informer might have been involved in the cell or had access to information relating to the cell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I don't remember, I remember nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR RICHARD</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR KOOPEDI:</span> Just one Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>	You have just said that it was publicly known that informers were killed during those days, do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Although I don't want to say as to who would execute but mainly people were killed during that time who were known or labelled as informers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> And those informers were exposed to the public to have been informers and that was made a reason why they were killed, the public was made to know.  Is it not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> During those days informers were killed, that was the practice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes and everybody knew they were informers, they were told "this is an informer who is being killed."?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> And in this particular case of Sicelo Dhlomo, he was thereby exposed to the public that he was an informer is it not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Are you able to explain why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Although there's nothing much for me to explain but the way we operated then, it was not exposed.  Whatever we were doing we were doing it underground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Did it not surprise you when you were instructed not to expose an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Did it not surprise you when you were given instruction by your commander not to expose an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> That did not cross my mind and again even if it did I would have said no, I think I'm mistaken here because whatever we were doing we did it underground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KOOPEDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Nothing in re-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Mr Zungu, just explain something to me.  At the place where Sicelo was killed, what explanation was given to you for killing him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Prior or after?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> I'm talking about were you not there when Sicelo was shot and killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> In your evidence in chief you said an explanation was given to you at that place and subsequently you were given more details.  Now let us start about the one that was given to you when you were at the place where he was killed.  What explanation was given to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Although I don't remember everything but what was said to me was the fact that we should not be surprised about the decision that has been taken because this person was going to be of danger to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is that all that was said to you on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Although I don't remember quite much maybe other things will come as time goes on but nothing much was said at any rate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Yes but you said subsequent to that occasion, that was the day when he was killed, a more detailed information was given.  What information was this?  What reasons were advanced for having Sicelo killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> After that that is exactly when I was told that a transmitter was found in his possession and that he also had a firearm but he never returned.  I don't quite remember other details but these are things I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Are you personally aware of any information as to Sicelo, if he was an informer, which he could have conveyed to the police about yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> As I said I had not known Sicelo for quite some time or some time, I was still learning or getting closer to him at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you associate yourself with the killing of Sicelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> You are referring to which period, do you mean after this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> When Sicelo was killed did you agree that this was a good thing?  You say you were given reasons subsequent to that.  Did you agree that it was a good thing to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I don't want to say whether I agreed or disagree, I have no answer but as I already said, the community at large also knew that if one has been found or it has been established that one is an informer there were no any other means but to kill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> If Sicelo was an informer, would it have made any difference to you as to whether he was in a position to convey information to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Okay, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Mr Zungu, did you see this transmitter that Sicelo been carrying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> You just accepted without question that he had in fact been carrying a transmitter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I was only told once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Yes but you say you didn't say the transmitter, you were told that he was carrying the transmitter is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Now the only reason therefore according to you that Sicelo was killed was that the fact that he was carrying this transmitter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> You mean according to me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Yes according to you, I'm talking about you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> What I heard is that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> No you told us before that the decision before had been that you should call Sicelo when had a ...(indistinct) and the question about what he had been doing, isn't that right, but that the possession of a transmitter changed that situation and it was therefore decided he would be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> With respect Honourable Committee Member, I do not recall this witness saying that was said by previous applicants but not him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">COMMITTEE  MEMBER:</span> When Sicelo disappeared and you didn't see him, did you as a group discuss his position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I was told that Sicelo has disappeared and therefore we must be alert, vigilant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Is that all that was said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Did you anticipate, did you except that Sicelo would be killed when he arrived or were you taken by surprise when in fact he was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I had no idea as I said because I did mention that I was only told after the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Alright, that you had accepted the fact that Sicelo had been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I did not say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> You didn't say that after a time you had accepted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Please may you repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Did you accept that it was correct to have killed Sicelo when he was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Even when I realised that but at that time there was nothing much I could have done or I could do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Isn't it a fact that you were persuaded to accept the killing of Sicelo because of these allegations that he was carrying a transmitter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Please repeat that question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> That isn't it a fact that you associated yourself with the killing of Sicelo because you heard that he was killing a transmitter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> If that had already happening whether I was also associating myself or not it mattered not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> But Mr Zungu, sorry, I must say that may you sound very vague and non-committal in your responses to the questions that are being asked but why have you applied for amnesty for this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I'm now applying for amnesty because this happened in the company of my comrades and I was part of them as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You didn't do anything, you did not even know why he was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> Yes as I already said I only got the explanation afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you accept that explanation, did you feel that those reasons were sufficient to kill Sicelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> I had no any other way but to follow what was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Why did you not disclose what had happened to the organisation or even to the family including the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> The state in which we were working and exposed to was obvious that whatever we were doing had to happen underground and to take place underground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you, sorry ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And it's correct is it not that you did not inform anyone of what you had seen happening that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZUNGU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right.  Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> As to the further witnesses, at present I have two.</p>

<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR RICHARD:</span> Sir, I must start by thanking you for coming to the hearing at such short notice and thank you for waiving proper notice of service of the subpoena.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will add our thanks to that so that we can dispose of this hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> In and during the period 1986 through to 1988, where were you working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> At the Detainees Parents Support Committee as a welfare officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What did this organisation do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> We were looking after the needs of the detainees and political prisoners.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now who else worked with you at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> The late Sifuma Sita, Daphne Mashele and Tommy Mashabane and also the late Sicelo Dhlomo was working as a volunteer worker with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When did the deceased, Mr Dhlomo, start working at the organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> I can't recall the date but I think he came in just after his arrest.  When he was arrested I'm not sure when in 1987, when he had a pistol with him, just after coming out of detention into the office and he was given a position as a volunteer worker.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And when did you first meet him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> I met him around '86.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was it as a result of his approach to the DPSC for assistance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now how many days would he be there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Usually he would come to the office from Monday to Friday and even sometimes we'll have tea parties for parents of detainees.  He'll also help in those situations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And now in October 1987 were you aware of any particular events, was he detained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes I know that he was detained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What do you know about that detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> I think on that day he was in the office with us and what happened was that mainly the ...(indistinct) which was bombed, the entrance downstairs, the security guard had there an alarm system ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I'm talking about October 1987, January 1988, there were two events.  Now according to my instructions on the 12th October 1987 Mr Dhlomo was detained while on his way to school, are you aware of that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> I'm not sure whether I can recall that or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now at that stage did you receive any request for accommodation or rearrangement of his sleeping arrangement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes I think he did because of the harassment which we got from the police and I had a flat in Hillbrow and I offered that he can come and stay with me because I was staying alone in that flat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when he came to stay with you, do you remember from when it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> I think it was from October '87 up until the date when he was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now at that stage were you a member of the MK?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And did that entail you having weapons in your flat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes I had weapons in my flat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And did Mr Dhlomo know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> He knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What sort of weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> I was in possession of a Makarov pistol and a Stetchem(?) and I had several grenades in my flat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when it came to entering and leaving the flat what was the arrangement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> The arrangement was that the flat, it was not registered in my real name and the other occupants of the flat even didn't know of my activities as an activist and also as an underground operative of MK and we were just as ordinary people just like them and entering, going in and going out was just as normal as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did Mr Dhlomo have his own key?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes I did make available a key for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And you were quite happy that he should be entrusted with that responsibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now how many nights a week would he spend at the flat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Sometimes he stayed a whole week, sometimes he'll say he's going to see his gran in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And how often did he go back to the township to see his family there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Not much, I think twice or once per week or over the weekend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now at the time you say he was in more or less daily attendance at the DPSC, was he ever visited by anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Sicelo I think he was one popular activist in the township so particularly during his days as a student activist they used to come to the office, some of his friends and colleagues at school because I knew for a fact he was a student at Pace College in Soweto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Do you remember the names of any of his visitors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> I remember only one and who is one person who knows my brother also, Rambo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What was Rambo's other name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> I've just forgotten, I'm not sure if he was Humphrey but I think I know the one Rambo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And if I said Sipho Humphrey Tshabalala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes I know the name very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Also known as Rambo.  Now how often would Sipho Tshabalala come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Several times he'll come to the office, not only to Sicelo, he also had very good relationship with the late comrade Sophie Masete.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And were you aware of any relationship between Sipho and Mr Dhlomo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Only as student activists, yes that I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you going on to something else?  Can I just clear up something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>	He worked for you from Monday to Fridays I gather you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As a voluntary worker, but now there's also been reference of him going to school and his school friends in that he was a student at Pace College.  How did he attend school when he was working with you for five days a week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> What I was saying, I think I said during his school days he was a student activist and Rambo, I knew him as Sicelo's friend during those days as student activist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So these people were not school friends at the present time, they were from the past?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now at that stage were you aware, I think you've answered the question but I'll repeat it, why Mr Dhlomo had decided no longer to live and sleep in Soweto?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> I think the problem was police harassment more than anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And do you remember whether he continued going to school after he came to your flat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> No, I don't recall that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now during the period October, November and December, were there any events of note other than that first arrest in October that might have alarmed you about Mr Dhlomo or made you suspicious of his behaviour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> To my level of understanding now because there was once an incident which happened at Khotso House when Security Police were coming in and an alarm rang and all of us we ran out of the office and Sicelo took the opposite direction of the entrance, the main entrance, and I went the opposite into the passage was the Black Sash Office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I'm sorry to interrupt you, that was in January?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I was coming to the 20th January.  I mentioned the period October, November and December, not January yet.  Was there anything that might have made you suspicious or doubt or uncomfortable with Sicelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now in January 1988, do you remember an event on the 20th, I think you begun reciting that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes, this is the event I was just explaining and he was arrested on that day, taken to John Vorster for interrogation and I can't recall whether he was released the same day or the next day, that I can't recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did he report to you what happened while he was being interrogated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> I think some of my colleagues in the office took a statement from him about the torture and stuff, of things happened to him during that period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now do you remember him ever having anything on his belt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> He had a walkman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Could you please describe the size and shape of this thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> I'm not good in sizes but I'll show it in ...(indistinct) it was a size like this one, something like this in a square shape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> It has been described in resembling about the shape and size of this object which is connected to the microphone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Now I'm not sure but walkmans which usually people had and put there, it could be the size of this thing possibly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was there ever any doubt in your mind that it was anything but a walkman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And it took cassettes which he played music to himself on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now did you ever see Mr Dhlomo in possession of a firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> At Khotso House?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> At Khotso house I'm not sure but I don't recall any stage when I saw him with a weapon in those offices.  Even myself, I couldn't go in with a weapon during the day there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where did you see him with a weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> At the flat, he was staying with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> We then come to Saturday the 23rd January 1988.  What did you do over that weekend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Sicelo on the 22nd if I recall, which was a Friday, he left and said he was going to see his granny and I was supposed to go to a conference in Cape Town.  I was flying on Saturday morning for Cape Town and we went together to the office, and when I went back to the flat he didn't come with me, I was alone.  He slept over in Soweto the Friday and it seems on the Saturday, met up with the late comrade Sophie Masete and he was given cash of an amount of between R1 000 and</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>R1 500 which was supposed to come to me.  I met up with comrade Sophie afterward because we were flying together to Cape Town and she said to me that she gave Sicelo that amount of money which was supposed to come to me and since then Sicelo didn't turn up until we came back from Cape Town on Sunday and Monday morning.  It's when we heard the news that Sicelo's body was found in the veld next to Emdeni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now one last question.  During the period that he stayed with you and you took care of him, did you ever have any reason to suspect that he might be an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Not at all because I think I was supposed to be his first victim if he was an informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now during that period there was a lot of activity with informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> It's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> How is it that the police identified him at Khotso House?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> The police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> I think because of his previous arrests, it was possible that they could identify him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you know about his television programmes and radio broadcasts interviews?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes I do know about those things, "The Children Against Apartheid", it's one of the interviews which we had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR RICHARD</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I take it you've never seen that television programme?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Sorry sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I take it you have not seen that television programme, it hasn't been screened here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> It was screened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it?  Here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When?  When was it screened here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Sorry Judge, I don't think it was screened but there was an uproar about it within the country just after it was screened overseas, yes it's true but it was in the newspapers, a lot about it in the newspapers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> It was not broadcast on national TV was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> No it wasn't, yes and I have a copy of the video, so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I have no questions for this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Thank you sir, I have no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Mr Tlhwale, this thing - just one or two things, this thing you've referred to as a walkman he had on his waist, who did it belong to and what was it for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> No, it was his, it was a tape playing cassette ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you say he was in possession of weapons at the flat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Can you give a description of those weapons, what were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> He had a Makarov pistol and two handgrenades in his possession.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did he support himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Generally as I said that he was a volunteer worker in the office.  A sum of money was paid to him monthly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So a volunteer worker didn't mean unpaid worker?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was paid monthly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Ja, during those times there were grants for volunteer workers for transport and for food.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This R1 500 that was to come to you, what was it to be used for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> The money was my personal money.  What happened in 1986, a friend was skipping the country, took the money from me and when he was in Zambia the ANC had to refund the money back to me and that's how the money came into the whole like chain of hands until it ended up in Sicelo's hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it would not have been going to Baragwanath Hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> I'm not sure of that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, because if it was your money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes, it was my personal money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR RICHARD:</span> May I ask two or three further questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>	What became of the handgrenades and Makarov pistol that Sicelo had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> I think that the night of Friday, I mean the day of Friday when he left I suppose that he left with those things because they were not in the flat afterwards.  It was only the material which belonged to me in the flat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you watch the cassette video that you had on the television programme?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did Sicelo's face appear in the video?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes it did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Prominently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Prominently, definitely so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now last question, was money given to detainees at Baragwanath Hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> Yes money was given to detainees at Baragwanath Hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Who gave the money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> We were a group of about four or five people in the office and mostly because even myself I was sometimes in detention and Ms Ntombi Mosikare was the person who usually went to hospital to give money to the detainees.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> If the deceased had been found with that amount of money, what sort of explanation would have been given to them?  Would you have said hold on, it's comrade Joe's money or would he have told some other story?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> That one I don't think I have a definite answer for it because I wasn't in that situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> But would he have told people your name if he was asked where he stayed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> I'm not sure sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR RICHARD</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry, just one thing Mr Tlhwale, did he tell you where these weapons came from?  What did he say about these weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> I think myself as an underground operative, part of my work was secret and I couldn't even discuss with him some of the things even units or cells which I belonged to and also I think that was his modus operandi, he couldn't say where, like to me, where he got the weapons but I knew that he was an operative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> In other words he never asked you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR TLHWALE:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> My next witness is Ntombi Jane Mosikare.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Good afternoon Madame, can we ask for your full names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">NTOMBI JANE MOSIKARE:</span> Good afternoon Sir, my name is Ntombi Jane Mosikare.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Mositare?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Mosikare - k-a.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> In what language are you going to testify?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> English.  (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a>	In and during the period 1986 through to January 1988, what did you do and where did you work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> I was working at the DPSC office as one of the full time staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And what were your activities there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Well, doing some advice work and also taking statements from people who were released from detention and also families who were coming to report that their children have been detained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now during that process did you ever arrange for legal representation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you arrange for legal representation for the detainees?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes we arranged legal representation also that people came out of detention were sometimes tortured and others suffered psychological effects so we had to send them to NAMDA and to the doctors as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now which attorneys did you refer ex-detainees to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> There were a number of lawyers around Johannesburg who were handling cases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And was Mr Ismail Albe's office one of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Right, now during that period you came to know the deceased, Sicelo Dhlomo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When did you first meet him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Well the office I think was opened in 1985 but I joined them early in 1986 after the killing of my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And when did you meet the deceased, Mr Dhlomo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> I'm not quite sure when I met him but I think it was 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> If I give you some dates in and during the period June to November 1986, he spent a period of three months in - he spent that period in detention, three months in solitary confinement of it.  Then again there was an incident on the 12th October 1987.  Was it in connection with either one of those incidents that he first made contact with the DSPC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> I think the first contact was with the mother because what happened is that when a person gets detained, then it's the mother that would come and seek legal assistance so I remember all three incidences.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And another one in 1987 when he was arrested, prosecuted and convicted of possession of a firearm, do you remember that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> I remember quite well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when did his mother come and see him, was it 1986 or 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> I think it was 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So it's logical then that on his release at December '86 or early '87 he would have made contact with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now in what way did you assist him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> At first is that when he was released from detention we would take a statement first and find out what happened in detention, whether he was tortured you know, those kind of things and whether he - in most cases people who would complain that after they were detained, they were asked to be informers, so we had to check with everybody so that if people, you know agreed to be informers so that they could be released then they would have to be referred immediately to a lawyer to make a statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was Mr Dhlomo one of those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> During that period if somebody had been detained, asked to become an informer, when you debriefed them, what would they tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Well we would really you know speak to them and tell them you know to be open on what had happened in detention and we would say that we would want to assist them in whatever way we can so that we make it, you know, easier for people, you know, to open up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And was it a frequent or infrequent occasion to hear a story that somebody, while in detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Can you repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was it a frequent or infrequent occurrence that individuals that had been in detention would report to you had to stop torture, had agreed to be an informer but now that they were out they were not going to be informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> I'm not sure that I understand what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did many detainees tell you that while they were in detention they had agreed to be informers because they were being treated so cruelly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And when they came to see you they continued to say that now they were out they would not inform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes, many of them would say that also that now, you know, "I agreed to be an informer because I wanted to be released, I didn't want to stay in the cell."</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now were those people who made that sort of report to you treated as informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And it was usual to accept after properly briefing obviously that statement that they were not informers and had no intentions of complying with their agreement with the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do I understand that these people would be referred to attorneys so that they could make a statement to an attorney about this attempt to make them turn them into informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes, definitely and some of them didn't know who the attorneys were because when you get detainees, the family that comes, so we would pull out the file and check if the case was reported and we would tell the person who his lawyer is and if the person, you know, came to the DPSC for the first time and the matter was not reported then we would look for a lawyer immediately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So it was usual to find files at some attorney's offices with basically amounted to debriefing statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now to which attorney did Mr Dhlomo go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> To Mr Ayob.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you refer him there or was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes, it was a DPSC referral.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So that means the fact that there is a coherent paper train of the various incidents in his files is in no way surprising, it's in fact what's to be expected?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now how well did you get to know Mr Dhlomo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> After his arrest, when he was found in possession of a firearm, he did a lot of work with the DPSC, he volunteered at the DPSC office and most of the staff members at that time were highly wanted by the police including the one that who was, you know testified Joe Tlhwale.  So in most cases they would come in and out and Sicelo was mostly available at that time so that's when I knew of him very well and the mother used to come and see Sicelo at the office so she used to say how poor she was because she was selling at the school so I was very sympathetic to him and that he was getting very little money for transport so I used to do some other things like buying clothes for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So you developed a close interpersonal relationship?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes at one stage I even offered a hiding place for him but he didn't want to go out in the East Rand where I was living and he said that he loved his grandmother a lot and he doesn't want to be far from his family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now during this period he'd obviously get to know various people who would be wanted by the police for various things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And in fact he had what amounts to a responsible and highly confidential job?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes, definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And did you ever have any doubts that he was a person that could be entrusted with that sort of responsibility and trust?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> No.  In fact what happened is that some other attorneys, when they went to visit detainees at a prison, even the ones that were held under emergency regulations or Section 29, they would give some legal notes to the lawyers and say please give it to somebody at the DPSC office and that was highly confidential matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And to the best of your knowledge he never betrayed your trust?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Just for the sake of the record, is it not correct that this arrest for a firearm is the event that led to him being convicted and sentenced to a five year period imprisonment, suspended?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And that was early in 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> I think it was late in 1987, I'm not quite sure of the dates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> That's the incident that you were referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now while he worked at the DPSC was he visited by anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes, there were a lot of comrades who used to come and visit him and including the family and they would also contact him through the phone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now do you remember the names of any of his friends or visitors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What names do you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> I remember Clive and I remember Rambo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When you say Rambo that's a nickname for somebody.  Who is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes, that's the third applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry, just to ensure that there will be no confusion on the record.  Isn't that Sipho Humphrey Tshabalala?  I thought that Mr Tlhwale said that was Humphrey, Rambo was Humphrey.  Do you know the full names of this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> No, not the full names, I only knew the famous names that we used at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were Clive and Rambo the same person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> No, Clive I would refer him as the one who appeared the second time yesterday and the other one, the one who was here round about two when I arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The third one, who was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> I know him as Rambo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  Now how often did these people come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Several times, I wouldn't count how many times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Do you remember seeing the one Sipho Humphrey Tshabalala during the period October '87 to January '88?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes, I would think that's the period when Sicelo was not staying with his parents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Where was he staying at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Well at first after he was released and I think what he said in court was that he was in possession of a firearm because he was defending himself and at that time when he arrived in our offices there were also other white volunteer workers and a lot of people were sympathetic to his case and a lot of people offered hiding place for him so he would stay in various places until he got a stable place with Joseph Tlhwale.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When did that place become stable, before or after October?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> It's after October.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And before that was he staying with various other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now you say the second applicant, that's Mr Tshabalala, who was the third applicant to give evidence, that's the confusion, came on various occasions.  Do you remember how often after October '87 he came?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Well I don't know how often.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> More than once, more than five times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> It's more than once but I cannot count how many times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> That's fair enough, now were you aware of any particular relationship between Humphrey Sipho Tshabalala and the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Well I don't know of any relationship but what I know that when he came to the office he would sometimes talk to him and sometimes they would walk out and after some few minutes Sicelo would come back to the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you see anyone else besides Mr Tshabalala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes, the second applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When did you see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Well as I've said, many of them I saw at the time when after Sicelo was released and he was, you know, away from the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was that before or after October?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> That was after.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now according to my instructions an event happened in January 1988.  Do you remember any event on or around the 20th of that month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> That was when Sicelo was detained at Khotso House.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> We were busy working in the office and at Khotso House they used to have an alarm system.  When the police came they would press it and then it would ring in all the offices then we would know that is the police.  So what happened on that day is that the security guard saw the police that entered through, you know, the front door and he didn't see that some of the police entered through the basement so Sicelo tried to run out using the stairs so that's when he was, you know, arrested by the police and they came with him and joined others who were already in the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now how did the police identify him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> They identified him as a person who had appeared on the television.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Were you aware of the television documentary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And also aware of various other broadcasts with Dutch Television, CBS News - I mean radio news?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes, a lot a media came to the office and they would say that we want maybe a child or a family and we would be the one to identify such families and you know, approach them first if they feel like, you know, being interviewed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now for how long was he detained on that occasion which started on the 20th January?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> If I'm not mistaken he was released the next day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now I know you haven't got a bundle of the papers before you - I'm indebted to my colleague - but between pages 58 and 66 there is a selection of newspaper clippings relating to the deceased and his detention in January.  Are you aware of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now particularly, think carefully before you answer the question, in and during October 1987, the year before, were there any similar press reports?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Before October '87?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Around October '87, specifically in October '87.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> I don't quite recollect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Would you recollect if there had been newspaper clippings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now on his release did the deceased return to the DPSC offices?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> I remember the last incident because immediately after the police have identified him they searched the office and Audrey Coleman said to me that I should take money from the petty cash and go buy Sicelo some toiletries so I went out to a shop opposite Khotso House about that and I gave it to him and I also gave him a track suit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now after he was released did he come back to the office and talk to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now if you turn to page 63 of the bundle in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> 63.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> It's a newspaper clipping.  Unfortunately it's undated as far as I can see.  There you will see two columns</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a>	"DPSC Says" and  Police Says"</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a>What was that about, what was going on in there?  Do you know whether he signed a statement while in police custody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> As I say that I don't quite recall it but I remember that after his release, it's actually Audrey Coleman who was taking his statement and I was laughing at some of the things that was said by the police when they released him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Do you remember what the police said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> The thing that made me to laugh was that they said they were releasing him to his grandmother which they were referring to Audrey Coleman and they said that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a>"Your grandmother talks too much."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when did you last speak to the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> On Saturday, I think it was the 22nd.  He phoned me at home in Duduza, it was five to eleven and he said to me that he wanted to discuss with me something that was very confidential and I said to him that I was on my way to town and from Duduza which is in Nigel next to Springs, it would take me another one hour to get to Johannesburg because what he wanted was that we should meet at the DPSC office and I asked him that can't that wait until Monday because I don't have any money and I have to go to town and he said well, he seemed you know doubtful and he said okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now there's been talk about a certain thing that he wore on his belt.  Were you aware of anything that he wore on his waist belt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes I was aware because he was listening to that while he was working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> I think something like a radio that one could listen to alone.  You know you could put something like this and then have it wherever in your body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And so if somebody called it a radio cassette or a walkman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Well I'm not sure whether it was using cassettes or it was just a radio.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now what did it look like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Well it was a square shaped, the length was not, you know, so much, it was like this but a little bit bigger than this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What colour was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Black.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now did you ever have any reason to doubt that it was anything but a radio or a cassette player?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> No I never doubted that because he was using it in the office while people were coming in and out, everybody was seeing that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now at any stage did you ever have any reason to believe that he might have been a police informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR RICHARD</p>

<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry, that was not very clear to me, the very last part of it.  Did you in fact see him in January after he had been released from detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Where did you see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> At the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What did he say had happened to him whilst in detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> I don't remember everything that happened, I think one of the things that he was questioned about was his involvement in the documentary film and ja, that's what I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did he make any mention of an attempt by the police to recruit him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What did he say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Well as I say that I don't quite recollect and I was not the person who took the statement but I remember him talking about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did he say he did in fact succumb to such pressure to work with the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> But you did not take the statement then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Okay, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you remember what day this was on?  I'm trying to work backwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Which one, the last arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja, the last time you saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> The last time I saw him was on Friday because I even, when he phoned me on Saturday I even asked him why didn't he talk to me on Friday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And it's on the Friday he said, told you he had agreed to work for the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> No it was, you know, after the release, immediately after the release that he said that, I don't remember the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well he was arrested on what day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Was it not the 20th, Mr Richard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Wednesday the 20th.</p>

<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> That is the answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see him on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not activated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You saw him again on the Friday?</p>

<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And which day was it you thought he told you he'd been, agreed to work for the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> In fact he was not telling me alone, he was saying it in an office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did he say how the police were going to make it possible for him to work for them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> No, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did he express any attitude about him having been successfully recruited by the police or having agreed to work for the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> As I say I don't remember you know, everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was he sent to a lawyer then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On which day, on the?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> On the day that he was released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And he also made this other statement on the same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR RICHARD:</span> May I ask one further question.  As a point of clarification, the version that I have is that while in detention on the 20th he agreed to be an informer so as to be released as soon as possible and be able to get on with his normal activities other than informing  on who he worked with, is that not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Nothing further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR RICHARD</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry, just one thing.  When he phoned you on Saturday morning, you said at about 11, did he give any indication as to what exactly he wanted to talk to you about?  Did he make any vague mention of what he wanted to discuss with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> No, he refused when I asked him and he said that he has to sit down with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did he say this was something sensitive, what did he say, how did he describe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOSIKARE:</span> He said it was confidential and he cannot say it over the phone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> The remaining two witnesses are the TRC's former investigator, that's Mr Pillay Zwane and Mr Lester Dumukude.  Mr Dumukude, I have no knowledge whether he has kept his undertaking to be present until today and Mr Zwane will be available tomorrow so I don't have anything further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is Mr Dumukude here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> I have some explanations.  Mr Dumukude spoke to me yesterday before we adjourned that he stays at work, he was given until Wednesday, you know re the hearing Ellis Park.  He had not anticipated that he would be kept here until after his leave days.  He further indicated to me that he was made to be aware that in fact this means that he might have to give evidence and be asked questions and that he thought he would need a lawyer for that but he just told me that and I passed on the message to both my learned friends here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you acting for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know where he works so he can be contacted?  I can understand when he was only expected to be here for a few days he wouldn't spend the rest of the week sitting here.  Do you know how he can now be contacted at work with a view to getting him here tomorrow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I am sure my learned friend and myself would be able to find him, his particulars are well known to the TRC Amnesty Committee so ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can arrangements be made for him to be legally represented so that we can conclude this matter tomorrow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Chairperson, if he has no objections with me assisting him I would assist, I would have no problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We would be most obliged if you would do that.  Very well, if the two of you can now make arrangements to make sure he is here tomorrow morning?  How long will we take?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I have only one point that I wish to cross-examine him on and that is the report mentioned in paragraph 6, page 11, where the first applicant Mr Dube says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a>"I then reported the matter"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a>...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That might take five minutes.  Very well, you could advise him on that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> I must say the evidence as it stands is that if I understood Mr Dube correct, he did not report to him, he reported to Grasskopf.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes and if Mr Dumukude confirms that then that's the end to the matter and we will have addresses from you after we've finished the evidence tomorrow morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> I was hoping I could persuade you to allow us to do written representations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well the policy of the Amnesty Committee of late has been that we will from now on we will endeavour to get oral argument at the hearing.  If you wish to amplify by written submissions later you may do so in certain cases but we would like you to deal with the witnesses certainly while they are all fresh in our minds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a>	What time tomorrow morning?  We don't need to start earlier.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> 08H30 Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well to me it makes no difference, I only have to walk across the road but I'm aware that others of you come from very much further.   9 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Chairperson, one last statement?  It is possible for me to arrange for the person mentioned by the last witness, Mrs Audrey Coleman, to be present to give evidence tomorrow.  She is the person who handled the debriefing on the Thursday/Friday.  Would the Committee desire it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't know what she can could say, what she can remember?  It's a matter I think you should take up with her because she's now being asked about something eleven years ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> She does remember quite clearly and I have spoken to her.  She has to be brought from Plettenberg Bay, I'll speak to her and see what her response is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is the statement she took still available?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I would have to ask her directly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It seems to me that if she took a statement at the time, by agreement that statement might be handed in and save having the expense of bringing the lady from Plettenberg Bay here because unless you feel she must come to say anything over and above what she said in the statement because really it's what he said to her what was recorded at the time.  What is your views on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> I'm not sure what my learned friend would really want to get from her.  As I understand it the evidence that she will be giving would not be contested so I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> In the light of that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well if you could communicate with her and with your learned friend then it might be possible by consent to say that he told them he had been agreed to become a police informer.  That is it or whatever it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I'm certain it's quite possible for me to get an affidavit from her setting out and if my learned colleague does not want to cross-examine her, unless subject to the Committee, I'm happy with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't want at this stage to bind us to say we will accept and agree to an affidavit when we haven't seen it.  It may raise all sorts of matters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Chairperson, what I shall do is phone her and see ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because nowadays I keep forgetting, if you can do things over fax and all sorts of other machines that you can get a thing back in 20 minutes, can't you?  Yes, well we'll leave it to you to decide.  From what you have told me I don't think it's necessary to fly her up here from Plettenberg Bay, it's  too much expense and inconvenience and having regard to the co-operation there has been throughout this hearing, I'm sure that agreement can be reached.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a>	9 o'clock tomorrow morning.</p>
