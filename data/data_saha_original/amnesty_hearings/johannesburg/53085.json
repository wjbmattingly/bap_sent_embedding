There were three things which appeared in my application.  Firstly it's murder which perhaps I thought I am involved because when I made this application it was at the time when I was confused and I did not have help and I didn't know as to whether\nshould I apply because even when you look at the date you'd see it was the last date of the submission of the applications therefore I was obliged because I did not know, I was obliged therefore to make an application.  After I met my legal representative it was clear that in the true sense I was not involved about the two incidents except the possession of illegal firearms.",
