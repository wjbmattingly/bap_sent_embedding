I would have liked to have apologised to the members of the public and others who are here for the hearing, which was supposed to start at \n9 a.m. I am told, for the fact that we are considerably later than that and explain that there were problems in that the applicant is in prison at the moment, and he was brought here but there was some difficulty in finding where he was being detained in this building, as it is not a building normally used for these purposes and that consequently delayed council's chance of interviewing his client and that is what has delayed the commencement of proceedings.\n\tBefore we start on today's matter, there is one further matter I would like to raise with Mr Black and that is the case set down for Thursday, no it is set down for Friday, the last day which was an offence allegedly committed on the day of the election and we would like Mr Black to confirm that the Act has been properly amended to extend the date to - that cut off date has properly been extended to that date, but there is nothing you have to do now.

He is represented by Adv Malan, instructed by Mr Nel of the firm of attorneys\nM.S. van Niekerk of Pretoria.\n\tMr Chairman, at the outset, if I may just mention that in this particular instance, the deceased was never identified and throughout the trial of Mr Vosloo, the identity of the deceased remained unknown.  As a consequence, next of kin and victims, we were unable to trace any of them.\n\tMy learned friend Mr Nel and I have both made extensive efforts, research and numerous efforts in order to obtain a copy of the judgement and the court proceedings, which took place when Mr Vosloo was tried for murder.  A letter dated 4 of April was handed to me by Mr Nel which I have requested, being given to the Chairman and the learned members of the panel which sets out the various efforts that have been made.\n\tIt would appear that it is not possible to obtain a copy of the court record, it seems to have been drawn in October some time ago, last year,  and it has not been returned to the archives.\n\tSo the only documentation which we, on behalf of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission have in our possession, are the documents which are now before the panel and I am given to understand by Mr Malan, that he has no intention of handing additional documentation. \n\tI submit therefor that the matter is ready to be heard.",

One matter that does cause me distress, is the fact that a file can be removed and thereafter disappear and I request that the relevant authorities continue to make enquiries as to how this file, and why this file, was removed by the woman named in the letter, on the 14th of October 1996 and to obtain a statement from her as to what she did with the file.\n\tAnd to investigate as to whether there was any ulterior motive in what she did because there have been other cases which we have been concerned with, where dockets and files have also disappeared, and I feel the time has come where the matter must be fully investigated and I request that that be done.\n\tNot by the firm of attorneys concerned, but by the relevant authorities, thank you.
