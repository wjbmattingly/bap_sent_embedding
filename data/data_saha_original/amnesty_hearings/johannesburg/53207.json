The objective sought to be achieved, was simply to disarm and to protect the community.\n\tOn the basis of that, I submit humbly that the action committed, was political.

This was not a premeditated thing to go and kill.  That is also that appeared during the cross-examination of Mr Nkuna who clearly stated that the person was armed, the person who ran after the deceased, was armed with a shotgun which it was a palm gun, and that corroborates the evidence of the applicant to say I was armed with a Makarov pistol and not with a palm gun, which was armed by one comrade Xolani, who then during the struggle, the shot went off.\n\tUnder this circumstances, I submit that a proper case has been made out and that the applicant be granted amnesty in respect of all the offences that he has been convicted of, including that one of robbery of a firearm of a Police Official, which he was not convicted of.

            "Mr Khumalo, you are giving your evidence in a fashion that makes it difficult to understand you.  You are supposed to have been called in to assist us in understanding the applications of the applicants.  You are making it extremely difficult to be on the same wavelength with you, wittingly or unwittingly so.\n\tUnfortunately you are not talking to people who are unaccustomed to terms like targets, to terms like (indistinct).  We have become accustomed to such terms, we have been busy with this process for almost three years.  We have already heard testimony from other applicants in relation to the activities of the SDU's in different parts of our country.\n\tWe would expect you to assist us as a General Commander of Zone 12, SDU structure.  I must register my disappointment with the manner in which evidence is being given.  I don't know whether you were prepared before you came in, to give evidence, because instead of assisting us, you are impeding our progress.  This matter is taking more than it should have taken.  We cannot allow this to go on.\n\tWe must in so saying lay some kind of blame to Ms Moloisane whom we expect as Counsel, who is conducting an application on behalf of her applicants, to make sure that whoever comes here to give evidence, has been properly prepared to give such evidence, and is in a position to assist us in coming to a just and fair decision.\n\tI have found you to be an extremely difficult person to follow in the manner in which you have given your evidence.  I thought it was so during your evidence in chief, but to my surprise it is so when you are also being questioned by the \nEvidence Leader, it is so when the members of the Committee are trying to assist you in trying to understand, in trying to comprehend your evidence.\n\tYou are making it very difficult for us to understand what you are saying.  We are now going to take a short adjournment and when we come back, we shall proceed with your evidence.  I want to give you the benefit of the doubt and think for you that you must be tired, that you probably need a break.\n\tWe will adjourn for five minutes.\nCOMMITTEE ADJOURNS\nFINDING : VUSI SIDNEY MONONI",

Mr Mononi applies for amnesty in respect of the following convictions:  the murder of Mr Mofumani Bernard Mathonsi, the attempted robbery of Mr Mathonsi's firearm, contravention of Section 2,36 and 32(1)(b) read with Sections 1, 39 and 40 of the Act.\n\tHe further applies for amnesty in respect of the robbery of a firearm from Mr Mathonsi.  All these offences were committed on 11 August 1993 at or near Diepkloof in the district of Johannesburg.\n\tThe applicant alleges that he and four other members of his SDU, were patrolling in the vicinity of Mandela Squatter Camp when they saw two uniformed policemen.  Their Commander, one Winki ordered that they should approach the policemen in order to disarm them, and take their firearms.\n\tIt is common cause that the applicant was a member of the SDU and that the SDU's engaged in such activities in order to arm themselves with a view to defending their communities during the political conflict of the time.\n\tWe are therefore satisfied that the applicant complies with the requirements of Section 20(1) of the Act with regard to his convictions.\n\tHowever, with regard to the act of robbery of Mr Mathonsi's firearm, we are not satisfied that this firearm was in fact removed from Mr Mathonsi by the applicant or his comrades at all, and accordingly refuse amnesty for this act.\n\tThe Amnesty Committee is of the opinion that the relatives and dependants of the deceased, Mr Mofumani Bernard Mathonsi as well as the victim, Mr Nkuna, are victims as defined in the Act and are accordingly referred to the Committee on Reparation and Rehabilitation for consideration as such in terms of Section 26 of our Act.\n\tThat is the decision Mr Leopeng.  AMNESTY IS THEREFORE GRANTED IN RESPECT OF THE FOLLOWING offences:  the murder of Mr Mofumani Bernard Mathonsi, the attempted robbery of a firearm belonging to Mr Mathonsi and in respect of contraventions of Section 2,36 and 32(1)(b) read with Section 1, 39 and 40 of the Explosives Act.

This decision will have to first go to Cape Town, which is our Head Office and our Executive Secretary in Cape Town will then cause this decision to be communicated to the Head of the Prison.  The Executive Secretary will also have to publish in the Government Gazette the content of the decision, particularly with regard to the types of offences for which you have been granted amnesty and the names of the victims in relation to which amnesty has been granted and then you will be able I think, to leave prison.\n\tHowever, your Counsel will make this explanation to you.",
