Then the community saw the need that we needed guns.\n\tSimange from Mozambique, that's where he was born, he told us that he knew where we can get the guns from Mozambique.  And then we needed one person with a passport who can accompany him.  I was the one with a passport and the community elected me to accompany him to Mozambique.  We went together.  We went via Zimbabwe.  We went to the Dongo Gara, that's a refugee camp for the refugees from Mozambique, it's near to Chipinga.  We stayed there, and his mother was staying there, the guy I was with, he was a refugee there.  We stayed at his home.  We met other gentlemen he knew.  We went to Mozambique.  We used the Sipingo border gate.  It's not a border gate in use, because it was bombed a long time before we went there.  \n\tWe went to Chipinga Bara, it took us seven days to get there.  These other gentlemen who accompanied us left us there, and they went and they brought back twelve AK, five G3, hand grenades, RG5, 12,5.  And the rounds for AK and G3 they were full of, they were full in a sack.  And RPG7 with six shells.  We brought them back.  We came back with these two gentlemen.   Just before we arrived to Beit Bridge we left them there.  When we were supposed to cross to South Africa our car broke, and then I had to come back here to fetch a car.  I told the community as to what was going on and they bought the parts to fix the car.  We fixed the car and then after we fixed the car we drove, but we couldn't trust this car any more.  We wanted to hide the other weapons.  I think it was about nine and a half kilometres away from Messina, or the bridge to Messina, in a forest there, we left the RPG7 and grenades there, and the pistols.
