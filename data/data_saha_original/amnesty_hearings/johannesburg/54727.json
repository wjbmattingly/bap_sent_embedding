He is the Chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and in many ways, the spiritual head, if I may put it that way, of the TRC.   On behalf of the members of the Committee and perhaps on behalf of the members of the community at large, I would like to express our hope and wish that he makes a speedy recovery from this illness.   The second point on which I would like to make a comment is that it may not be known to interested parties that representatives of the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee, who are vitally interested in the proceedings, are here and their representatives will be here throughout these hearings.   We have with us this morning Professor Piet Meiring of the R&R Committee and Mr Joe Japhta who will be present throughout the hearing and Mr Tom Umtanta.   The purpose of making this announcement is for applicants, their witnesses, victims, dependents and relatives of victims who are here or who may be here, to be advised that such assistance and counselling as they may require in these difficult matters will be provided by members of the R&R Committee and that as soon as it is possible, either now or during the short adjournment, legal representatives should convey this to their respective clients and witnesses that should they require counselling or assistance, that will be made available and that they themselves make contact with these representatives.

I know in the 1981's there was a shoot-out between freedom fighters and the police in this ridge right behind the farmer's house, but I can specifically go and point out this farm, I will still get it, it is as I say it was used as a permanent base by one of my groups, the Western Transvaal group, led by Captain Koos Vermeulen.

            "I proceeded to the border accompanied by Paul Van Dyk, Tshikalanga, David Tsekelanga and at the time I mentioned also the name of Almond Nofomela, where I met up\n2a\twith /...\nMR JANSEN\t23\tD J COETZEE\nwith Captain Rudy Kraus of Zeerust security branch, under which security branch the area of Gaberone fell as far as ANC collecting of information and the electing of targets in the area is concerned.   I also met up with Captain Jan Coetzee, the officer who took over from me at Vlakplaas, but at that stage was still with West Rand Security based at Krugersdorp under the Regional Office of West Rand.   The Zeerust Security Office was under the Western Transvaal Regional Office which is Potchefstroom.   With them was Joe Mamasela and Koos Vermeulen was on the farm.   At the farm the target house was explained the exact place where this house was in Gaberone, was detailed to us by Captain Jan Coetzee and Rudy Kraus and also a layout of the house, a plan of the house where each bedroom is and where Rola apparently slept.   In the south-eastern corner was a bedroom where he slept and it was also told to us that if a bakkie, a 1 400 Datsun bakkie was parked in front of the house or next to the house, then Rola would be home.   I then first sent Almond Nofomela and Joe Mamasela in with a police bakkie, a Cortina 3 litre bakkie, with false registration plates which I thought at the time.   They went for a reconnaissance during the daytime, in the afternoon of 26 November 1981.   When they returned I then went in to do a reconnaissance of the area and the house and came back to the farm.   At 7:45 that night, the border post closes at 8 o'clock, Koos, I instructed Joe Mamasela to take the bakkie through the border gate into Botswana and drive to Gaberone, coming back at about 9 o'clock to pick us up, after the rest of the team would have crossed over the border fence.   The team consisted of myself, Captain Koos Vermeulen, W/O Paul Van Dyk, Captain Rudy Kraus and Captain Jan Coetzee as well\n2a\tas /...\nMR JANSEN\t24\tD J COETZEE\nas Joe, Almond Nofomela and David Tshikalanga.   Joe was already in at that stage then.   We crossed the fence as discussed and at 9 o'clock that evening, Joe came back and picked us up.   At the point where he picked us up, Captain Rudy Kraus and Captain Jan Coetzee stayed behind as markers so that we could coming back flashing our lights they would get into the road and show us the way where we could branch off to the right of the border post coming from Botswana to South Africa and cut the fence and get back into South Africa through the cut border fence.   As we entered into Gaberone, I left Paul Van Dyk and David Tsekelanga with the bakkie about one and half street blocks away under a tree, from the target house, whilst Koos Vermeulen and myself with Almond Nofomela and Joe Mamasela proceeded to the house on the corner, right next to the target house.   At that stage, right in front of the target house was a disco or a party going and there was a lot of people in the street and the dogs at the corner house were barking at us and I then saw that a storm was building up and decided to wait for the storm to break and use that as a cover for after the people have been chased into the house and the dogs into the kennels by the rain.   This happened round about midnight when thunder and lightening broke out and heavy rains.   There was a power failure in the area in the town and we got up and walked down the street into the front gate, past the bakkie which was parked at the back of the little verandah at the back of the house.   I've asked Koos Vermeulen to take position at the south-eastern window of the bedroom and fire towards the street, away from us, whilst we would go into the house and fire in the other direction.  As we were still discussing of how to, how next would we break the door\n2a\tdown /...\nMR JANSEN\t25\tD J COETZEE\ndown now two women entered the kitchen with a lit candle and opened the back door.   Joe grabbed one of the women and closed her mouth and shot at her at point blank.   I heard someone drop to the cement like a bag of bones and the other woman turned and ran into the house.   Shots were fired at her in, and at a stage I pushed Almond and Joe Mamasela aside, entered the house and shot with a sub-machine gun, a HMK with which Koos Vermeulen also had one issued, with a silencer on and a canvas bag to pick up, to pick up the empty shells that they don't drop on the scene.   With that I then fired.   Koos Vermeulen was also instructed to hurl a hand grenade through the bedroom window and after the shooting then we started running towards the back fence of the house, past Koos Vermeulen and at that stage he didn't fire one shot as yet.   I don't know whether he then did a small, a few rounds on the room but for sure he did not throw the hand grenade.   We got over the back fence into the street, into the street at the back of the house, ran to the bakkie and left for Kopfontein border gate whilst it was heavily raining.   I should just mention also that Joe Mamasela and Almond Nofomela was armed with a Tokarev and a Makarov, if I remember right, respectively.   Approaching the border gate, flashing the lights, Rudy and Kraus and Jan Coetzee came out of the veld, stopped us, we branched off to the right of the road and eventually found our way through the mud and whatever, cutting the border fences, three of them, there were three - the main border and then on each side of that specific borderline was also a smaller fence.  Cut the three and went back to the farm where we re-grouped.  Joe Mamasela was sure that the woman he shot was Joyce Dibali and it was that she was dead.   My conclusion would\n2a\tbe /...\nMR JANSEN\t26\tD J COETZEE\nbe after reading evidence in the end, a statement by Mrs Dibali that she was actually the one who ran into the house and that the one that collapsed on the cement on the back verandah must have fainted or something, or emulated a fainting, and that is why I was so sure that she was shot, because Joe was so sure.   It later proved that Mrs Dibali ended up with three wounds, I don't know whether it was actual bullet wounds or shrapnel wounds and I don't know exactly what the injuries was of the woman that fell on the back verandah which was held in Joe's arms.",

As a result of that shooting, as a result of that pick-up a shooting ensued a day or two thereafter in this ridge behind the farmhouse where Koos Vermeulen was staying.  The Dibali, that it was this specific Dibali I don't know, did not know anything about it.   There was also allegations about a Dibali being abducted from Soweto by Almond and Joe Mamasela.   I could not remember that in exile after being reminded about it when, amongst my return I just could remember the fact that during an abduction in Soweto Almond's private car - a Mazda - was used and because the registration number was taken by witnesses on the scene and the police eventually got to the registering address where the vehicle was arrested, at his mother's place I think, we then decided to hide the vehicle.   That I only could remember afterwards but I did not tie that specific incident up with the Botswana raid, well even up to now I can't remember ever seeing this Dibali person that was abducted.\nNO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DE WET-MARAIS",

Gunshots rang out as he and Joe were shooting and I was standing behind them in the house in the kitchen if I remember correctly.   Thereafter when he went out, it was myself and Joe and I shot and as we were leaving I shot once if I remember correctly and there I wasn't seeing anyone, we were just shooting randomly.  I just had one shot towards the closed doors and we went out.  We passed where Lt Vermeulen was standing near the window, I cannot remember whether he shot, whether he fired a shot or not because at that stage the way the shots were ringing I cannot say.   We then ran to the car and went back and we crossed the border through the fence and we went back to a certain base which we were using which was somewhere near a hillside where there was a house.\n3b\tQUESTION: /...\nMR DE WET-MARAIS\t63\tNOFOMELA",

We went to Soweto and when we were near the place, I can't remember who remembered between Joe and myself, who remembered that we did not swop number plates.   I remember Joe going to urinate outside so that he could wet some sand and then he covered my number plates, I think he was driving at that stage, because he knew Soweto better than I did.   I'm not sure but we went to Soweto to the house where Dibali was staying, Joe knew that house, he even knew the address.

Joe suspected that he was there and he said that we should go into the house and we then went into the house looking for Mohabi Dibali inside this house.   When we entered one room, Joe said here he is hiding behind the wardrobe.   We found him and took him and Joe then said we want our money from him, he sort of made as if we were there to get some money from Mohabi, pretending as if he owed us money.   We took him and put him into the back seat and I cannot remember whether Joe got into the back seat with him or whether it was me.   As we pulled away in the car this girl came running out and I could see that she was going to other people not too far from the house.   We then left and we went to Roodepoort near the mines where we told we would meet Captain Coetzee and Vermeulen.   We then met them there and there was also a Captain Grobbelaar from Protea Security Branch.   From there we followed them until we got to Zeerust where we went to a house near a dam which was not occupied, together with Mohabi Dibali.   Before we went there, we had taken him out of the car so that Captain Coetzee and Grobbelaar could see the person whom we had just abducted by taking him out of the back seat of the car where we had put him.   They then advised us, instructed us to close up his face and also tie his hands behind his back and put him back into the back seat.   We then went, proceeded until we reached this house where he was questioned\n4a\tintensively /...\nMR DE WET-MARAIS\t78\tNOFOMELA\nintensively about his sister who was in Botswana.   Although I was not part of the team which was interrogating him, Joe was there because he knew his sister and he knew him as well and he could argue with him when he was saying something that Joe knew, which was in dispute with what Joe knew and Grobbelaar was also there and Vermeulen, as well as Jan Coetzee.   There was a time where he was assaulted and then taken outside and when he got outside, Captain Vermeulen would bring him so that we could also assault him and we'd assault him and hit him with fists and kicked him.   There was a stage where he lost consciousness and he was lying on the ground.   This happened the afternoon where we had abducted him and that evening, that night he was interrogated and he would answer questions in several ways and he was assaulted to such an extent that he was swollen.  The people that were assaulting him the most were myself, Joe Mamasela and Vermeulen.   Grobbelaar and Coetzee did not do anything.

            "ANSWER",
            "Mr Chairman on the farm with me was an askari, Ernest Ramathlala, a Lesotho citizen who was responsible for the first attack attempt on the life of Chris Hani.   He together with David Tshikalanga, Almond Nofomela and Joe Mamasela and there might be others, approached me for a loan of R5 000 to go and buy diamonds in Lesotho for, from the relatives of Ernest Ramathlala who apparently had very good\n1b\tcontacts /...\nMR JANSEN\t113\tD J COETZEE\ncontacts on the mine and some of them working there.   I did then borrow R5 000 from my mother-in-law, Mrs Crause(?) and handed it to them.   It was, must have been towards the end October, beginning November 1981.   Almond, David Tshikalanga and I don't know who else proceeded with Almond Nofomela's private car to Lesotho and returned a day or what later, I'm not sure how long, with five little small diamonds the size of a matchstick, stained, cracked and a little bigger one like the nail of my small finger perhaps, a yellow one which I later learned is called \"canary yellow\".   To me as a layman I could see that they were cheated if one just thinks of your wife's, the size of that diamond on her ring, engagement ring, and I sent them back to go and give the man's diamonds back and bring my money back.   Joe Mamasela, Almond Nofomela and David Tshikalanga proceeded to Lesotho, whilst the group, the Vlakplaas group as a whole departed for Durban where we were summonsed to do surveillance work.   I must just mention that this was also at the time, it was in November and also at the time of the murder of Griffiths Mnenge.   Again some time later an evening shortly afterwards they returned, Joe Mamasela, Almond and I think David Tshikalanga was also present in a, if I remember correct, a grey-blue Datsun Laurel automatic, with Lesotho registered number plates.   They reported to me that they couldn't get the money back, they lured the dealer out of Lesotho, they then took him to a turn-off, gravel road just to the north of Lindley, the first one after you turn off to Lindley, coming from or in the direction of Johannesburg, a few kilometres down that road in a bluegum plantation, the diamond dealer was shot and killed.\n1b\tThey/...\nMR JANSEN\t114\tD J COETZEE\nThey took his car and apparently waved, whilst this was happening, David Tshikalanga apparently followed in the police bakkie of Almond Nofomela and they waved him on to continue on the road.   I immediately took the car to Sgt Schutter's house who was the Sergeant in charge of the farm, the sort of foreman who had to look after the farm whilst we were on operations, to his private house where I asked him to strip the car of all possible identification and keep it until further notice.   David Tshikalanga and Almond Nofomela then accompanied me in my official car to Lindley.  My concern was that the body might have been discovered in the meantime and I should get to the place as soon as possible.   Joe Mamasela was dropped on the farm if I remember correctly to continue his work with Jan Coetzee in West Rand.   As I say Almond escorted us to or showed us the way to this road just before Lindley, gravel road coming from Johannesburg now, turning off to the right and him and David Tshikalanga went into the bluegum bush.   A few minutes later they arrived dragging a corpse by its pants, at the feet, one at each of the feet, and we bundled him in the dark into a plastic bag that was used or that is used by mortuaries to transport bodies in.   I put him in the back of my official vehicle on my whole armoury that was inside and the three of us continued via Bethlehem, where I put in petrol and signed the petrol book, and on our way to Durban where we arrived the next morning.   I reported in brief to Brigadier Van Hooven and then with his permission, left to get rid of the body.   Almond and David Tshikalanga were left in Durban with the rest of the group whilst Koos Vermeulen, Paul Van Dyk and myself continued towards the Swaziland border to a ruin, the ruins of an old house,\n1b\tfarmhouse /...\nMR JANSEN\t115\tD J COETZEE\nfarmhouse, just to the south of the then so-called Houtkop border post.   We waited there whilst Paul Van Dyk took my car, with the body, Koos Vermeulen and myself whilst Paul Van Dyk continued with my vehicle to Piet Retief to an old Swaziland friend of ours that was working at a garage in Piet Retief, Fred Howells(?).   From him he collected tyres and brought it back to the farm or to this ruin where we were waiting.   A fire was built of tyres and wood and the body in the plastic bag put onto this fire and set alight.  I remember Koos Vermeulen cutting open the bag at a stage and taking out the ID document of Lesotho passport of the guy, of this person, but I have never had a look at it to identify the guy.   We stayed there through the night and burned the body to ashes and returned to Durban the next day.",

            "ANSWER",
            "Mr Chairman during the McNally and Harms Commissions of Enquiry after the revelations of Almond Nofomela on 19 October 1981 and after I then went into exile to support the allegations of Almond, Joe Mamasela denied, with his superiors involved - Jan Coetzee then at Vlakplaas, Brigadier Schoon and the police upper echelons, that Joe Mamasela knew me at all.   They said at the time he never came to Vlakplaas and it was impossible for me to have known Joe Mamasela in 1981 because he only came to Vlakplaas in February 1982, more than a month after I've left.   I then described this incident of the Lindley shooting to demonstrate the fact that they were lying and misleading the Harms and McNally Commissions and that Joe did in fact know me, but the whole lot was covering up from top to bottom.   Now this incident at Lindley happened whilst we were working at the Lesotho border, again in the Ladybrand area, and at the time I think it was also in October if I'm not mistaken there is some more specific times, dates available, we were requested to all pull up from all directions, Koos Vermeulen from Western Transvaal, myself from Lesotho, Paul Van Dyk wherever he was and to meet in Middelburg with the Eastern Transvaal regional commander, who was then Brigadier Schalk Visser, after two men were shot in a caravan near Ogies by a so-called ANC cadre.   On our way I drove in my official car, a Datsun, followed - alone - followed by Almond Nofomela driving his bakkie and Joe Mamasela as passenger on the left front seat.   As we came down the hill approaching the Lindley turnoff I could see a yellow and blue two-door Ford Escort vehicle turning in from Lindley town into the\n1b\tmain /...\nMR JANSEN\t121\tD J COETZEE\nmain road in the same direction that we were travelling, in other words north to Johannesburg, towards Johannesburg.   The vehicle was swerving viciously over the road, the driver had his fist out the window shaking and I pulled up next to him and put on my vehicle's siren to try and pull them off because I could immediately see there was five black men, occupants in the vehicle, two in the front, three at the back and that they were heavily or had been heavily drinking.   As, just after the Lindley turnoff, you come up a hill where they threatened to go over the white line to the right of, in front of oncoming traffic, I gave way to the right for them to enable to come back to the left of the road and the next moment just heard shots and glass flying into my vehicle as I was next to the Ford Escort.   Looking over my shoulder I saw Joe Mamasela hanging out the left front door, emptying his Tokarev pistol on the vehicle.   Eventually on top of the reach at the same gravel turnoff to the left where they took the Lesotho diamond dealer and killed him, the vehicle turned to the left and as I learned later from the passenger, he pulled up the handbrake.   The vehicle came to a standstill and I stopped at the T-junction while Joe and Almond pulled the people in the vehicle out of the car.   Joe of course in a normal manner, kicking karate and fisting them down.   At the time, a Pastor, an Afrikaans Dominee stopped with his wife and asked if everything was okay and I was just worried to get this member of the public away and I said there was nothing to worry about, everything is under control, I was the police and then I stopped the assault and then immediately realised there was trouble.   We got the inhabitants into the car, the bakkie, and we started collecting all possible Tokarev shells that were\n1b\tlying /...\nMR JANSEN\t122\tD J COETZEE\nlying next to the road.   I then handed Almond my 9mm pistol and asked him to pull off a few shots, rounds, and pick up the empty shells and bring it with to the, where was this town, Lindley police station.   We drove to the police station together with the car that was shot at and the inhabitants, I asked Joe to keep a low profile it was already then turning dark, whilst I went into the charge office with  Almond Nofomela and the occupants of the vehicle and arranged for blood tests of the driver to be taken for the injuries, especially the man in the middle back seat, that was sitting in the middle back seat he was wounded in the back to be attended to by the local district surgeon or the doctor who acted as district surgeon.   The left front passenger and the right back seat passenger just light flesh wounds, bullet wounds under the chin.   I immediately rang Brigadier Schoon, reported the matter to him and asked him, and already told him what I did as, if he agrees with what I did by picking up the empty shells and let Almond fire off a 9mm pistol.   He agreed with the suggestion that to keep Joe's identity secret and his involvement that Almond should pretend that he was the guy who actually shot at the vehicle.   I then prepared at the Lindley police station my and Almond's statements and a docket.   We charged the driver of the vehicle for drunken driving.   The back seat passenger was transported to hospital and after that we left for Middelburg where we joined up with the rest of the group.   After I left Vlakplaas on 31 December 1981, and whilst being with Narcotics Bureau in Pretoria, drug squad in Pretoria under Colonel Basie Smit, I was called early January if I'm not mistaken in 1982, maybe towards February, by Brigadier\n1b\tSchoon /...\nMR JANSEN\t123\tD J COETZEE\nSchoon and Brigadier Jan Du Preez at this stage and instructed that I should accompany..(end of 1b)...Van der Merwe, in my manuscript I couldn't remember his name, who had close contact or good contact, whatever one wants to call it, with the Free State Attorney-General, who was Advocate Tim McNally.    This resulted, happened as a result of the Attorney-General of the Free State that decided that Almond Nofomela must be charged because of his shooting on a vehicle where he knew he could have injured innocent people and not specifically the driver.   Almond then refused to take the brunt for Joe.   We went to Welkom police to the Divisional Commissioner's office, we spent the whole day there making some statements, I'm not sure exactly what went, what happened but I know it was in the line of terrorists, possible terrorists in the area and that this was confused with possible terrorists and so, and this was forwarded to the Attorney-General's office in the Free State.    Eventually the case was squashed against Almond, it was withdrawn, the passenger in the middle back seat was paid an amount of R1 500 round about I think and the driver of the vehicle was found guilty of drunken driving.   In documents that I've seen later, I know that is now the Attorney-General's decision to prosecute Nofomela and that happened middle December I think, 1981.",

Colonel Jack Cronje on Vlakplaas, the Commander, it was after me Captain Jan Coetzee and then a Colonel Jack Cronje came to the farm and then I threatened whilst my phone was tapped and it was admitted in court and that it was tapped and it was illegally tapped during my departmental trial, I told my listeners on the phone, the upper echelons, that the later Chief of the Security Police, Lt Gen Piet Viljoen's wife was monthly drawing the illegal money from a non-existing source for months on end.   I then got a message from Sgt Schutte on the farm that if I would make that public they would, they are threatening to expose the diamond dealer, the Lesotho diamond dealer story.

We did not succeed in completing it, we only came to a certain page, I think, up until page 125 because the lawyers for Human Rights who made date appointments for the Harms Commission in London did not want to listen to me, did not know what I was up against, and we were forced on to the plane to London and I could not succeed in completing this document.

I completed it and returned to Zambia on 13 May 1990, after the Harms Commission, when I signed it, dated it and handed several copies out to the ANC and advocates in preparing for other cases, it was never altered, changed.  I think if the Committee might just look at the second part of the preface, where it specifically said, explained how several factors prevented my brother, that's now referring to me, written by my brother Ben\n\"..from producing a reasonable, spell-checked document in Lusaka and London.

September I said we could not trace them.  That is not true.  I have just checked on my notes.  September's relatives I did trace.  September's full names are Glory Sedibe.  In this matter I contacted, as I indicated this morning, the Minister of Defence, Joe Modise, who is the brother-in-law to September, and I subsequently learnt that actually the wife to Minister Joe Modise is a sister to September and I spoke to her as well.  This was on 11 December 1996.  The sister to September, that is Mrs Jackie Modise, agreed that I can send Form 2 to her as the sister, which then was done.  This morning at 6 in the morning I phoned Mr Joe Modise's\n21.1 - 3B\thouse/...\nMR MARAIS\t175\tMR A NOFOMELA\nhouse to find out when are they available.  Mrs Jackie Modise said to me that she will not attend but she has deemed it necessary to forward the amnesty Form 2 to Glory Sedibe, that is September's wife, who is presently in Zambia and she continued and stated that Glory Sedibe, who is September, has a brother who is currently in the Transvaal, but she does not know the address nor the telephone number.

I remember it was during the day, I cannot remember what time it was, I was with Johnny Mohani, who came to me and told me where - I knew where Lourens and them stayed - but he said to me that Lourens and them have money, lots and lots of money in their house which we can go and steal.  So I did not have money at the time and I had a large family to take care of at home and the money which I obtained by going out to work in places like Durban and Rustenberg was money which I used to claim for travelling at Vlakplaas, and when De Kock came he said that I should not be sent out any more, that I should remain at Vlakplaas and I found that by staying at Vlakplaas I did not receive this extra money any more, and I had somewhat adjusted my budget to accommodate that and I had just bought a house and furniture and my car was at the garage and I had a lot of expenses and I found that what\n22.1 - 1B\tJohnny/...\nMR MARAIS\t226\tA NOFOMELA\nJohnny Mohani was saying to me about this money that we were going to go and steal there seemed like a good idea and I agreed because of my financial problems.  When we got to Mr Lourens's house we found him there and when he appeared he said to me, what are you kaffirs doing on my farm?  And he was carrying a firearm and there was no chance for me to run away.  That annoyed me, the fact that he called me a kaffir, especially when I thought of the way which I worked at Vlakplaas because quite often I worked for whites who were oppressing blacks and today here a white man is calling me a kaffir.  This term that I absolutely resented.  I was angry and he grabbed me and we wrestled for the firearm he had.  I had a knife and  firearm in my possession.  While we were wrestling I took out the knife and I stabbed him with it.  He fell with the firearm.  From there onwards I found that Johnny had already gone inside and I called him, not knowing what he had found inside the house.  I lit a candle which I had found and put it under the curtain to set the curtain alight so that whoever arrived there would think that the house had burnt down to eliminate any traces of even Johnny's fingerprints if police were to arrive.  We did not proceed to do what we had set out to do because of what then happened between Mr Lourens and myself.",

            "Mr Chairman I have no re-examination but before this witness stands down I want to place certain matters on record with regard to the drafting of his affidavit, since there has appeared contradictions between the evidence of this witness and the contents of his affidavit and it could be necessary for him to confirm certain of the matters that I place on record inasfar as they fall within his knowledge.   Mr Chairman since August\n2a\t1996 /...\nMR DE WET-MARAIS\t239\tADDRESS\n1996, my instructing attorney Mr Knight has endeavoured to get instructions and funding for this matter through the police where Nofomela was employed at that stage.   He could not do so and when the dates were set for the hearings in Durban of this Committee, he still had not obtained instructions to instruct counsel.   After the dates were received, I went to the Legal Aid Board with Mr Jansen to convince them that Mr Nofomela is entitled to legal aid and that we should carry on with drafting the affidavit.  Until today we have not received formal notification from the Legal Aid Board with regard to this application.   Our attorney was also in contact with Mr Mpshe's office during that time and submitted affidavits for Mr Coetzee and Mr Tshikalanga.   Mr Mpshe's office urgently wanted an affidavit from Mr Nofomela and I and Mr Jansen drafted this affidavit on a Sunday afternoon from my consultation notes with Mr Nofomela from seven years ago, during the Harms Commission and from the affidavits of Mr Coetzee and Mr Tshikalanga.   The next day, the Monday, I went to prison to consult with Mr Nofomela in order to get him to sign the affidavit and to correct whatever needed to be corrected.  When I arrived at the prison I was informed that, which was quite surprising for a prisoner serving a life sentence, that a computer said that he was \"temporarily out\".   Apparently he was at the De Kock trial where the judge in the trial summoned all witnesses to attend the sentencing of De Kock and we could not consult and we could not change anything in the affidavit at that stage.   That night we faxed an unsigned copy of the affidavit to Mr Mpshe's office since they insisted that they needed it urgently in order to try and get the witnesses and victims together for the\n2a\thearing /...\nMR DE WET-MARAIS\t240\tADDRESS\nhearing which was due to start the next Tuesday in Durban.  I was not available the rest of that week and Mr Jansen on the Wednesday assisted us and went to prison and got the affidavit signed after Mr Nofomela browsed through it and corrected the one glaring mistake where he at the Harms Commission gave the false evidence with regard to De Kock shooting Mponja in his presence.    We arrived in Durban for the hearing which, as you will know, the Committee wanted to start with as soon as possible since there was a criminal trial set down in the matter of Mr Mkenge's murder for 2 December.   We consulted on the Mkenge matter that morning before the hearing started in Durban and that is how the evidence was led there.   After the hearings in Durban you will also remember that I withdrew then since we still had no instructions from the Legal Aid Board and it was not sure what our situation was.   Mr Nofomela was also not happy with the way things went in Durban since we could not have proper preparation and proper consultation due to the time pressures at that stage.   I was only re-instructed last week Wednesday to continue with the matter.   During the December recess or just before the recess there was an application in the Supreme Court in Pretoria brought by Generals in the Defence Force to get a court order that the State Departments where they were employed during the times they committed the acts for which they now seek amnesty, that they should be ordered to pay for their amnesty applications and this has still not been sorted out.   However, we consulted last Thursday and Friday on the five matters that we prepared for Monday's hearing and those were, according to Mr Mpshe's instructions, that we could decide which matters we wanted to call first.   None of\n2a\tthose /...\nMR DE WET-MARAIS\t241\tADDRESS\nthose matters included any of the matters that the applicant confirmed in his evidence yesterday.   Yesterday we did not expect to do the confirmations before all the evidence on all the incidents had been finalised and therefore when we were asked by Mr Mpshe whether we would do the confirmations yesterday after lunch, we did not consult on those incidents, it would have necessitated a further adjournment in order to do that and the applicant has rectified the shortcomings in his affidavit during his evidence.

            "Thank you, Mr Chairman, I appear again on behalf of Brigadier Willem Schoon.  As indicated in a letter to you last Friday, I will make short submissions on his behalf.  I had the submissions typed in memo form.  I understand copies have been made;  it is before you as members.\n\tMy client Brig Schoon received notice on the 15th January this year in terms of section 19(4) of Act 34 of 1995 informing him of these proceedings as a person implicated or having an interest herein.  I have requested Adv Mpshe to provide me with a copy of the applications, which was granted, and for which I thank him.  I was given the applications of Mr Coetzee and Mr Chikalanga, so we assume that my client is not implicated in the application of Mr Nofomela.  This enabled me to take instructions from client regarding all the allegations therein implicating him.\n\tI have had the opportunity of consulting with Brig Schoon and it is apparent that he is implicated by Mr Coetzee in his written application in no less than 10 separate incidents for which amnesty is now being sought.\n\tMy instructions of Brig Schoon is that Mr Coetzee is once again proving himself to be an utterly unreliable \n23.1 - 1A\twitness/...\nMR WAGNER\t269\nwitness and that the majority of allegations against my client are disputed by him.\n\tHowever, for my client to prove this, Mr Coetzee will have to be cross-examined in detail on each and every incident and allegation and in view of the many occasions where Mr Coetzee has testified in the past and all the different versions given by him to date, proper cross-examination in this regard could last a couple of weeks in my estimate. \n\tThis, the Committee has indicated to me, is quite impossible inter alia in view of time constraints applicable to this forum.  So it was decided that a largely limited cross-examination of Mr Coetzee will serve no constructive purpose whatsoever and that I should merely put on record on behalf of my client the issues disputed by him.  So I will deal with them one by one. \n\tThe first incident where my client is implicated is the murder of Peter Dlamini and Selby Mavuso which you will find on page 7 of the papers.  In this regard Mr Coetzee alleges that Brig Schoon gave the order for the elimination of these two victims.  I wish to put on record this is denied by Brig Schoon as a blatant lie.  He has no knowledge of this;  it is simply denied.\n\tThe next allegation is the incident on page 10 of your papers, the murder of Gonisiswe Kondile.  It is alleged by Mr Coetzee that Brig Schoon was involved in this matter and in the process gave him certain instructions.  This is also denied by my client.  My instructions are that he was not involved in this matter and that he never gave any instructions in this regard, as alleged or otherwise. \n\tThe next incident is the murder of Ace Moema which is\n23.1 - 1A\ton/...\nMR WAGNER\t270\non page 12 of the papers.  I have consulted with my client and my instructions at present are that he cannot remember this incident and due to a lack of time we were unable to investigate this matter fully and at present we are in no position to comment thereon.  If necessary, and if allowed, we can deal with this at a later stage.\n\tThe next incident is the conspiracy to murder Mr Marius Schoon, that is on page 19 of the papers before you.  My instructions are that my client has knowledge of this incident.  But, as far as he can remember, this was an incident initiated by Mr Coetzee himself.  Therefore my client denies the particulars of this incident as set out by Mr Coetzee in his papers. \n\tThe next implication is found on page 21 of the papers, namely the attack on Joyce Depalis house in Gaberone.  Brig Schoon denies that he had any involvement in this matter whatsoever and specifically denies that he gave any orders to Mr Coetzee as alleged by him. \n\tThe next incident is the kidnapping of one Joe Pillay, the incident described on page 23 of the papers.  In this regard my instructions are clear.  Brig Schoon admits his involvement in this matter and I am allowed to tell you that he has already applied for amnesty in this regard.\n\tThe next incident is the attempted kidnapping of an ANC member called General.  This is the incident on page 25 of the application papers.  It is alleged by Mr Coetzee that Brig Schoon gave the instructions to kidnap this person in Swaziland.  My client specifically denies this allegation and bears no knowledge regarding who gave such instructions, if any. \n\tThen the incident on page 28 of the papers, the cover-\n23.1 - 1A\tup/...\nMR WAGNER\t271\nup of the murder of a diamond dealer.  It is alleged by Mr Coetzee that this person was murdered and that my client was informed regarding the particulars thereof.  My instructions are that Brig Schoon has no knowledge of this incident and that the allegations of Mr Coetzee in this regard is denied by him. \n\tThen we have the cover-up of a shooting incident at Lindley on page 31 of the papers.  Mr Coetzee alleges that my client was informed of this incident and that he was  part of the subsequent cover-up.  My instructions are that Brig Schoon was in fact informed of a shooting incident, but that it was dealt with by other officials.  He denies that he was part of any cover-up whatsoever, or that it was done with his approval.  \n\tThe last incident where my client is implicated is the one on page 44 of the papers, the theft of a labour union vehicle.  My client remembers that he received money from Mr Coetzee to be handed over to Colonel Van Rensburg, but my instructions are that he was brought under the impression that this was a private transaction.  He therefore denies any knowledge of or involvement in the unlawful actions as alleged by Mr Coetzee.\n\tIf I am allowed, Sir, I have two further points which I would like to put on record.  It is on page 4 of the document before you.  I would like to put on record that three further clients of mine are implicated in the application of Mr Coetzee, they are General J J Viktor, Colonel J C Coetzee and Colonel R Krause.  They have not properly been notified in terms of section 19(4) of your Act.  Although Mr Mpshe faxed copies of notices in this regard to my offices the day before yesterday, it is\n23.1 - 1A\tinteresting/..\nMR WAGNER\t272\ninteresting to note that in this notices Mr Mpshe you identify my clients as potential victims.  I don't know whether that was seriously intended. \n\tI have not been able to take instructions of these individuals in this regard, and therefore I have no option but to reserve all their rights.  However, it is noted that this Committee is apparently conducting its procedures without complying with the explicit provisions of the said section, which will most certainly raise a question mark regarding the regularity of these proceedings.

I read a letter that you wrote to us and you make the same point, and this point emerges again in the document that you have been reading on page 1:\n\"To prove this Mr Coetzee will once again have to be cross-examined on each and every incident and allegation.  In view of the many occasions where he has testified in the past and all the different versions given by him up to date, proper examination in this regard would last for a couple of weeks.  This the Committee has indicated to me is quite impossible, inter alia, in view of the time constraints applicable to this forum\".\nNow, I am not so sure I understand what you are conveying, but let me tell you the impression - one of the possible impressions which may be conveyed by this what you have said which causes me problems.  An impression may be gotten from what I have just read that you are saying that the Committee has told you that you would not be allowed to cross-examine Mr Coetzee, and if that is what you are saying I would be happy to know why you say that because as far as I know, people who so wish and people who have got interest in proceedings can have legal representation which entails that if they want to put questions to witnesses they are allowed to do so.  But of course, like in all other tribunals, be it a court of law or not, cross-examination must know some limits.  The Committee allows cross-examination, but like all other proceedings, no cross-examination can be limitless, but the point I am making to you is that the Committee has never barred anybody from cross-examining. Bearing in mind of course the fact that cross-examination must know limits\n23.1 - 1A\tin/...\n275\nin all proceedings.   We have never barred anybody from cross-examining witnesses.  Neither did we, to the best of my recollection, and I want to make that point because you have been reading this thing into the record, you have raised it in the previous letter, let it be known that we did not bar anybody from cross-examining witnesses nor shall we do so.  In fact, we have drawn some guidelines.  This Committee has drawn some guidelines which advises practitioners and other interested parties as to how we intended to conduct our proceedings and it was in those guidelines that we indicated that people would be allowed to put questions.  That included legal representatives of people in your client's position.  We have circulated copies of those guidelines and I am sure Mr Mpshe would have given you a copy thereof.  So to the extent therefore that you are conveying or giving the impression that your client has been denied the right to cross-examine Mr Coetzee, I must tell you that that has not been the attitude of the Committee.",

Mr De Kock acknowledges that there has indeed been such an attack, that he was personally present at the time of the attack.  He refers to other persons, white officers who were involved, Warrant Officer Freek Pienaar, Sergeant Chris Rorich, Warrant Officer James Van Ziel and Colonel Chris Deetlefs, although in his affidavit he says that he was not physically present at the time of this operation and that he merely monitored the operation in the sense that the informant who provided the information to initiate this operation was controlled by him.  \n\tMr De Kock also says that in this operation which Mr Nofomela refers to, a certain Mr McFaddon and ... Zwalibanda Nyanda were killed by them.  They killed them.  A certain MK cadre known as Lawrence in this operation succeeded in escaping and Mr De Kock says that it came to his attention that this person during cross-examination later by the ANC, or by interrogation by the ANC's security branch in Angola was killed. \n\tMr Chairman, Mr De Kock refers to the other incidents which were mentioned in Mr Nofomela's application, the so-called ... persons in Swaziland and it was approximately, according to Mr Nofomela, November 1985.   Mr De Kock says that he took note of this paragraph but he would like to point to the fact that at that stage he was the commander of Vlakplaas at C1.  Mr Nofomela's allegation is that this operation took place under the command of Colonel Jack Cronje.  If that was to be correct Colonel Jack Cronje was no longer in charge of Vlakplaas at that stage.  Mr De Kock concedes that this attack might have taken place, but his\n23.1 - 1A\tsuspicion/...\nMR HUGO\t282\tADDRESS\nsuspicion is that this attack probably took place in 1983 and at that stage Mr De Kock, to the best of my knowledge, was not yet in South Africa, and he was still affiliated to the Koevoet Unit in South West Africa.  In Mr De Kock's submission he says that he is clearly being implicated here to an operation that happened in 1983 while he was not in South Africa. \n\tMr Chairman, as far as the incident described by Mr Nofomela as the murder of Japie Maponya, Mr De Kock says that Mr Nofomela was on a continuous basis in several forums where he gave evidence that Mr De Kock was responsible for the killing of Mr Japie Maponya and that he was present when Japie Maponya was shot in the head by Mr De Kock at Vlakplaas.",

He also says in this paragraph that Mr Nofomela is incorrect when he says that this operation took place under the command of Mr De Kock.  It is simply not true.  This operation was already ordered at the stage where Mr De Kock became involved in this operation.  This operation which gave rise to the unfortunate death of Japie Maponya was at an advanced stage when Mr De Kock arrived on the scene, and at that stage this operation was under the command of Warrant Officer Nortje who, according to Mr De Kock, in his affidavit was instructed by Colonel Johan le Roux who later became a general.  \n\tMr Chairman, if we could just proceed to the so-called Lamontville killings or Chesterville killings.

He says that in actual fact he was asleep in a police barracks in Durban and that he was awoken early the morning by then Warrant Officer Willie Nortjie, Vermeulen and Makata(?) and informed that they had killed a group of people in a shooting incident. \n\tMr De Kock further states, which supports Mr Nofomela's allegation that before they left for Durban he arranged that an AK47 attack weapon should be drawn with the intention of using in the operation in Durban.  He says that the acquisition of this AK47 was with official permission, it went through the right channels and he goes further to say that he went and acquired this AK47 at the Security Branch Headquarters in Pretoria and he further states that when he went to fetch this AK47 it was clear to him, and he realised, that there was a large quantity of AK47 guns and magazines at the Police Headquarters which was available to them.  He says that he was not involved in the shootout and\n23.1 - 1B\tthat/...\nMR HUGO\t284\tADDRESS\nthat a shootout happened on information received by Willie Nortje and at the time where he became involved. \n\tMr Chairperson, if you could just grant me the opportunity, I'd like to go to the so-called Amsterdam killings.  Here Mr De Kock says that Mr Nofomela is correct and he is giving a true reflection of the incident.  He further states under oath that the other person who was involved in this incident was Major Chris Deetlefs, Warrant Officer Labuschagne and a Warrant Officer Pienaar.  \n\tHe also says that this incident took place after information had been obtained that the Piet Retief Security Branch and that branch was closely involved in this incident.  He also says that this operation was launched against ANC members who were previously responsible for planting landmines in the Eastern Transvaal and he says that when this operation took place they found that the people who were killed were in possession of hand grenades and that they also had AK47 rifles and other military ammunition and weapons. \n\t He proceeds to say as far as Mr Nofomela's allegation that Mr De Kock said that he did not believe in court procedure and that they should rather kill the people before the time, he says that he categorically denies that and he would not have said that they should proceed to just murder people at random.\n\tMr Chairperson, if I could also just go over to the next incident where Mr Nofomela referred to the abduction of Glory Sedibe or a certain September.  Once again Mr De Kock  says that Mr Nofomela is correct.  There was such an operation planned. \n\tMr Chairperson, Mr De Kock further states in saying to\n23.1 - 1B\tyou/...\nMR HUGO\t285\tADDRESS\nyou that this operation was planned and executed under the instruction of Brig Schoon and that Mr De Kock, acting on this instruction, proceeded in his turn to plan this operation and execute it.  Once again he says that there were other people involved with him, Mr Chris Deetlefs and a Warrant Officer Pienaar.  He then goes into detail to describe how there was a wrestling and Mr Sedibe resisted and how he was injured in the process.  For example he had a scratch over his nose, a deep cut over his nose, and that it took four persons to control him. \n\tWhat is so interesting, Mr Chairman, is that Mr De Kock says that the intention was never to eliminate Glory Sedibe, alias September.  On the contrary he says in his submission that they wanted to retain him at all costs because they realised that he was going to be of such value to them and he was going to be able to provide them with valuable information.  He also says as far as the other aspect, which I marked the day before yesterday which you addressed, that the allegation of Mr Nofomela ... (CHANGE OVER TO TAPE 1 SIDE B) ... On their arrival at the police station in Swaziland, it was necessary for them to break into the police station since it was under lock and key.  \n\tFor interest's sake he proceeds to say that in this process he was confronted by a young Swaziland police officer who was armed with a G3A automatic weapon which he pointed at Mr De Kock.  Mr De Kock in his turn drew his firearm and pointed it at this police officer and Mr De Kock succeeded in convincing the policeman to throw his weapon to the ground.  Mr De Kock further states that he does not know what happened to this G32 weapon, but it could possibly have come back to South Africa. \n23.1 - 1B\tHe/...\nMR HUGO\t286\tADDRESS\n\tHe also says Mr Chairperson that Mr Sedibe was then\nbrought back to South Africa and in terms of section 29 of the old Internal Act was detained for a while and that Mr Sedibe in this time was dealt with by a Warrant Officer Freek Pienaar and apparently Warrant Officer Freek Pienaar succeeded in convincing Mr Sedibe to work for the South African Police, more specifically the Security Police. \n\tMr De Kock was then informed that Mr Sedibe, as a matter of speaking, had changed loyalties in the meantime and he was no longer loyal to the ANC but that he had decided to pledge loyalty to the South African Police and when Mr De Kock heard that he personally went and arranged that Mr Sedibe's wife and child be brought down from Mozambique to South Africa and he further states that he arranged himself for the wife and children of Mr Sedibe, were given false identity documents so that their lives weren't in as much danger when they returned to South Africa.\n\tHe also says that Mr Sedibe then joined the South African Police and Mr De Kock himself was responsible for that.  \n\tHe confirms that Mr Nofomela is correct in saying that Mr Glory Sedibe, alias September, was indeed the brother-in-law of the current Minister of Defence, Joe Modise, or the brother of Mr Modise's spouse.  Mr De Kock also says in this sworn affidavit that Mr Glory Sedibe, in spite of the fact that Mr De Kock was aware of the fact that there were family ties between Mr Sedibe and Minister Modise that he never provided the Security Branch with any information about Mr Modise. \n\tIf I could just proceed with the other aspect which\n23.1 - 1B\tMr/...\nMR HUGO\t287\tADDRESS\nMr Nofomela dealt with and that is the so-called Lesotho attack in 1986.",

            "Two things.  In the course of the proceedings I was scribbling some notes but I decided probably to shelve the notes and just speak to impress upon the honourable Judge, Chairperson and every member of the proceedings how one feels about the case itself.  And in the course of the\nevidence given by Dirk Coetzee, he did mention the fact\n23.1 - 2A\tthat/....\nMR MPSHE\t312\tT M MOEMA\nthat Isaac Moema, my brother, was somebody who was very intelligent, very quiet, non-smoking person, non-drinking person.  And what happened on the basis of that observation, on the basis that probably at the time of his capture and taken to Vlakplaas he did not fit within the mode of their culture and therefore he deserved to die, to be killed.  I feel strongly about it.  My mother is not here today, my father is (indistinct).  When we left this morning from home she said, she cannot stand the pain of listening to the proceedings about how gruesome a death her son died.  So she said go and listen and reflect on what the proceedings are and express her deepest I don't know what, but very, very painful for her and now she is waiting at home, she does not know what is happening, she expects us to get back to her and tell her something.  I am not quite sure when I get back home what is it that I will tell her to ensure that - to find solace in whatever I am going to tell her.  But if being intelligent, being quiet is a criteria for one to die then it really brings to light the kind of anarchy that reigned at the time at Vlakplaas.  It caused for me to begin really questioning why is it that I have to explain something that is so obvious and the facts are there for everyone to see. \n\tIn 1991 I think, at the time of the Harms Commission, if I am not mistaken, 1991, I am sure, yes, I was called in to give evidence at the Harms Commission, and I went through this, I am going through this again.  My mother wasn't there, I was in London, she was here, Dirk was in London, he couldn't give evidence to the Harms Commission because of his conditions of being in exile, I was in exile, I was called in to give evidence, I did give evidence.  But what\n23.1 - 2A\twas/...\nMR MPSHE\t313\tT M MOEMA\nwas clear was the ineptitude, the obvious lack of sensitivity of the pain that one was going through, listening to what was going on and clearly from the word go the Harms Commission was a farce, and I am not trying to construe that the Truth Commission is a farce.  But one would expect much more from the proceedings that are going on here.  My mother would like to know where her son is, why was it that he had to die.  If they felt he was a threat to the State, there was recourse to the legal proceedings, the criminal justice was available if he was a criminal, or if there was any case against him.  If it was just felt that he was a threat to the State at the time, a charge should have been laid against him and he would have gone through the normal court proceedings and be sentenced like many others that got sentenced and went to Robben Island and many other prisons that we have in the country.  So that by saying this one is not - I am not so much here to protest, to send any protestation against the applicants in the amnesty, that is not what I am here for. I am here to express the deepest - Your Honour, I left the country because of the pain I'd gone through.  I've lived in exile, I've lived under very harsh conditions, but this is one of the worst moments for me to be sitting here to try to say how the family feels about what has happened and ... (witness distressed) ... can I round off by asking two questions and hopefully I will be able to let my mother who is at home probably sleep in peace.  Just two questions.  Can somebody go to her and say I have committed the murder, I am sorry.  The second one is, can somebody take us or take her to say this is where your son is, this is where his last remains are, if there are any remains that are still available for one to see.   I am not\n23.1 - 2A\tin/...\nMR MPSHE\t314\tT M MOEMA\nin a position to proceed.  I've got a whole list of questions that I wanted to ask to satisfy myself, but I don't think I should proceed.
