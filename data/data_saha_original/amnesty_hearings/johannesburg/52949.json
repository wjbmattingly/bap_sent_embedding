Mr Chairperson, but I would like to go to the question of the ambush at Vereeniging.  The question was raised that civilians were attacked, Mr Chairperson.  Mr Chairperson, if the Committee has the submission of PAC which wanted to clarify the question of victims - of civilians being targets and where they used, they extracted a speech from the speech of the founding president of PAC which forms as their basic document, that speech, as one of the basic document of the PAC which is always referred to, whatever they did.  Where they use an analogy of a sjambok in that speech, they also in their submission use that analogy of a sjambok, Mr Chairperson.  Just if the Committee can allow me to quote it in full?",

            "Just to explain the question of - Mr Chairperson - the question was asked from Sobuke by Janus where I'll quote from the beginning, the book itself, Mr Chairperson, Manaliso Robert Sobukwe\n\"But you are anti-white, but are you anti-white or not?  The question is, what is meant by anti-whitism?  It is not merely an emotional term without a precise signification.  Let me put it in this way, in every struggle, whether national or class, the masses do not fight in abstraction, they do not hate oppression or capitalism, they concretise this and hate oppressor, be it the Governor General or colonial power, the landlord or the factory owner or in South Africa, the white man.  But they hate these groups because they associate them with their oppression.  Remove the association and you remove the hatred.  In South Africa then, once white domination has been overthrown, the white man is no longer white man's boss but is an individual member of the society, there will be no reason to hate him and/or he will not be hated even by the masses.  We are not anti-white therefore, we do not hate the Europeans because he is white, we hate him because he is an oppressor and it is plain dishonesty to say I hate the sjambok, not the person who wields it.\"\nThat closes my quotes, Mr Chairperson, and on that basis, Mr Chairperson, anybody, ordinary person will ...(indistinct) that simple saying that every white person is an oppressor.  If you take it, an intellectual like that one who was a university lecturer, their leader, founding president put it that way that it's not because he's white, it's because we associate it with our oppression and therefore we hate, therefore we cannot fight the system, we have to fight the person who is wielding.  It's plain dishonesty to say I hate the sjambok, not the person whose wielding the sjambok because the sjambok did not just take itself and hit me.  It's just like to say, Mr Chairperson, when people say look I hate guns as if the gun is doing all the job on it's own, yet he is the person who is holding the gun who is wrong.  That completes my argument Mr Chairperson.",
