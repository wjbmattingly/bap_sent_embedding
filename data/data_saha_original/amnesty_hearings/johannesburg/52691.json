That was one of the reasons advanced to Advocate Bosman on here question.\n\tNow my question is, despite divulging this to the comrades that brought them there, this is before any assault as I understand it, why do they now suddenly deny even membership or affiliation to UDF and that acknowledgement, that confession has to be beaten out of them - to follow your own questioning at an earlier stage Mr Tloubatla.",
