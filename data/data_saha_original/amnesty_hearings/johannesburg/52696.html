<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>MARIUS ETIENNE VISSER:   (still under confirmation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The applicant already gave evidence, but I'd like to amend something, that the word "later" must be inserted before "Phil Klopper", meaning "later Phil Klopper told us that General Oelofse", page 93.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was this gentleman your client, Mr Prinsloo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you have already... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Knoetze.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> May it please you, Mr Chairman.   Mr Visser, can I ask you to look at page 12, paragraph 17 of the set of applications?   That application is the application of Phil Kloppers.   I am reading it to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>"At nine o'clock I arrived at the roadside cafe and brought the people to attention.   I told them that the waiting period is over and that the revolution will start today countrywide.   I gave them the instruction of General Oelofse.   They were informed that General Oelofse wanted to see corpses, and I took out the two pipe shotguns and gave it to Etienne Visser and Martin van der Schyff who did not have weapons.   I gave the instruction that we have to set up a roadblock where people will be asked if they had weapons or ammunition, and if they had we would seize that."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>Do you see there that Mr Klopper said that he gave you the weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Furthermore, I'd like to refer you to page 239 of the record, 249 of the record, I will read it to you.  It is Mr Kloppers that gives evidence</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>"MR KLOPPERS:  And it was said three of them did not have weapons, and Martin van der Schyff, Etienne Visser, I gave two pipe shotguns to them."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>Can you remember that in his evidence he said that he gave the pipe shotguns to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I can hear that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Can I then furthermore refer you to page 31 of the set of applications, it is the application of Deon Martin, paragraph 11.   It says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>"Not all of us in the group had weapons and Phil Klopper gave two home-made pipe shotguns that he received from General Oelofse to Etienne Visser and Martin van der Schyff.   Gerhard Diedericks had a baton."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>Can I refer you to page 28 of the record, where he gave evidence in front of this committee, he gave the following evidence:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>"And at the roadside cafe itself, Phil Kloppers took out two shotguns and, or handmade shotguns, he handed over one to Etienne Visser and the other to Martin van der Schyff."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I do understand it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And then page 45 of the set of applications, paragraph 8, that is the application of Matthew's.   Have you got it in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>MR KNOETZE:	"Not all of us had weapons, but Phil Klopper gave to Etienne Visser and Martin van der Schyff each a pipe shotgun, home-made shotguns.   The pipe shotguns were given to him by General Japie Oelofse."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>	Can I then refer you to page 61, paragraph 5, it begins on page 60, have you got it in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>MR KNOETZE:  	"Not all of us had weapons, but Phil Klopper gave to Etienne Visser and Martin van der Schyff each a pipe shotgun (home-made shotguns).   The pipe shotguns were given to him by General Japie Oelofse."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>	Then page 77, paragraph 6, that is the application of Meiring.   You can read that paragraph again, you will see that they are the same as the others, with the spelling mistakes included.   Can you see it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Then page 121 of the record, when Meiring gave evidence in front of this committee, I read it to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>"MEIRING:  At that point I was not certain who did he give them to.    One was given to Martin van der Schyff and the other one to Etienne Visser."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>That is a reference, if you read the foregoing paragraphs, referring to the hand shotguns.   In other words, it's Meiring's evidence in front of this committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And then page 109 of the set of applications, paragraph 14, that is the application of Badenhorst.   It begins at page 108 at the bottom</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>"Not all of us had weapons, but Phil Kloppers gave Etienne Visser and Martin van der Schyff each a pipe shotgun (home-made shotguns).   The shotguns were provided by Japie Oelofse."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>Can you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And then page 131, paragraph 3, that is the application of Diedericks</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>"Not all of us had weapons but Phil Kloppers gave Etienne Visser and Martin van der Schyff each a pipe shotgun (home-made shotguns).   These pipe shotguns were given by or provided by Japie Oelofse.   I only had a baton."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>Can you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Then page 93, that is your own application, paragraph 6, will you just read what it says in your own application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>MR VISSER</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>"Not all of us had weapons, but Phil Kloppers gave Martin van der Schyff and myself a pipe shotgun (home-made shotguns).   These pipe shotguns were provided by General Japie Oelofse."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And that statement you made under oath, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, that is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And all these other applications that I referred you to, were they done under oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And the evidence that you gave and which I referred you to, was that also made under confirmation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Yesterday for the first time after my client filled in an amended application, for the first time Mr Klopper talks about something that has never been mentioned before and says that my client took one of the weapons from... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With respect your honour, Mr Chairperson, it was never said that the weapon was grabbed from someone, it was said that he was handed over, and then Diedericks will give evidence that he said what the problem was and that he did not know how to work this weapon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> The evidence was that my client took this weapon and said, "I will show you how to shoot a kaffir".   MR PRINSLOO:  I understand the evidence to be, Mr Chairman, that my client took the weapon from Diedericks, saying to him or to the group, whoever, "Give me the weapon, I will show you how I shoot a kaffir".  That is what was said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Yes, Chair, in terms of my notes, it was prefaced by "It would not have come out, but..."</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I suppose, I think I recollect something like that, except that I thought, I don't know if this really makes any difference, maybe I misunderstood, I thought it was at the scene... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> No, no, M'Lord, Mr Chairman... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...when he said, "Bring this..."... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> ...it was at the road, at the roadhouse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see.   All right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> At the roadhouse.   So... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairperson, can I just rectify that.   My learned colleague said in English, "He grabbed the weapon", and it's a difference than taking it off someone.   So he will have to rectify that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Maybe I can just help you here.   I did indeed wrote it down verbatim.   He said Van der Schyff took the weapon from Diedericks and said to him, "You do not know how to shoot, I will show you."</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Ja.   Mr Chairman, with respect, whether he grabbed it or whether he took it, the crux of the matter is, according to the evidence, that he, on his own initiative, saw to it that he got it in his hand, but even that isn't so important, what is important is that which he allegedly said, namely, "I will show you how to shoot", and that is what I'm about to try and indicate to be a falsehood.   The point, Mr Visser, is that for the first time yesterday this information was provided, or allegations was made, although these allegations are in opposition with evidence that was given in this court under oath and it is in opposition to what you said in your application as well as the other applicants.   I put it to you that it is a lie and that the clear difference is now made clear again between my client's application and yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is your opinion, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> No, it is not my opinion.   You, under oath, said something else.   Why did you, under oath, lied in your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> This is a misleading question.   It is general knowledge that he had a pipe, or Diedericks had a pipe shotgun at the scene.   What is under discussion now is a technical point, how he got this weapon, and that was at the road cafe, and the words that was used in getting this weapon.   It is not this applicant's evidence, Klopper said he grabbed the weapon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> No, Mr Prinsloo, with respect, it was this witness that said it wouldn't have come out, Van der Schyff took this weapon by Diedericks and said, "I will show you", I can read you the note, "I will show you how kaffirs will be shot", and that is the verbatim I wrote down.   Now the question is very clear, how did Van der Schyff get the weapon, did he take initiative or did he get instruction, that is two different answers, if it was handed to him with an instruction or did he take his own initiative, and that is two different sets of evidence, and I think Mr Knoetze may ask questions or cross-examine the witness regarding this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Will you answer please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> The statement that I made to you was that the accusation against my client that he took the weapon and said, "I will show you how to shoot kaffirs" is a lie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is his word, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> He also answered that the previous time.  I refer you again to paragraph 6, page 93, you've read it, it says there, or you don't mention there that he took the weapon.   You say there that Phil Klopper gave the weapons to you and Martin van der Schyff, and that same evidence I read to you from Phil Kloppers' evidence in front of this committee and as well as Deon Martins and Meiring's, every time it was said it was given to him, not to someone else, and then by mistake or by other means he got hold of it.   Can you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> I repeat my statement for the last time, the accusation that he would have said that, "I will show you how kaffirs will be shot", it is a lie, he never said that.   What is your answer on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, what can I answer?   If he says that, he is saying it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm sorry, Mr Knoetze, can I just try to help?   In your statement you said that Mr Klopper gave him the weapon, in your evidence, you said that he took this weapon from Diedericks.   Can you tell me what the correct version is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, all that we were trying to do was, we tried to shorten the story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I'm asking you, what is the correct position, was it handed over to him by Mr Klopper or did he take it from Mr Diedericks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, he took it from Mr Diedericks. CHAIRPERSON:  And he said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> "I will show you how a kaffir will be shot"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you just explain that to me, because this is strange to me, if I can just handle it now, why did he say that it wouldn't have come out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Like I said, Mr Chairperson, we wanted to shorten this story.   I thought that it wouldn't have been relevant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why is it important to say it now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Because the witness now, or the applicant now change his evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you will be incriminated by his amendments?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, he did not insult me and I don't want to insult him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.   Mr Van der Schyff will say that the weapons was indeed given to him and Diedericks, and not like you just gave evidence or testified that it was given to you and him, what do you say about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I would say that that is a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> He will furthermore say that at your and Martin's smallholding, Diedericks' weapon was handed over to you.   Then only did you get the weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is a lie, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Furthermore, Mr Van der Schyff would deny that at the roadside cafe that's where they talked about the revolution that would start that evening and that this is the real McCoy, he will state that it was not said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Then he is the only person who did not hear that, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KNOETZE</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Dreyer, have you questions to put to the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Just a very few questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They will have to be very few, because he has not incriminated your client, because normally we call upon implicated people to come and answer, to respond to incriminating evidence made against them by witnesses.   So this witness, as far as I recall, he has not at all incriminated your client.   But there may be, albeit a tenuous link between his evidence and that of Mr Kloppers, that is very tenuous.    You may just have to ask a very few questions indeed.   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR DREYER:</span> Mr Visser, can I just start at the same point where my learned friend started with Mr Van der Schyff?   I'd like to refer you to page 12 of the applications, paragraph 17, and also paragraph 5 on page 93.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>Yesterday when you gave evidence, you were pertinently asked by the legal representative which instructions were given at the roadside cafe by Mr Kloppers to you as part of a group, and your answers were as follows... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, if I can just say I broadly told what happened there, I did not refer to specific points.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I would refer to his evidence as opposed to the two applications, just in connection with the... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Inaudible)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Yes, I did, but I also said that as opposed to his evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Page 93, paragraph 5.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> If I may just repeat my question.   Yesterday, when you were asked by your advocate, "What was the instruction at the roadside cafe?", then you started and said that you were told that this is the real McCoy and the general said that he wanted to see bodies or corpses, and that hard options should be practised?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> And just after that the follow-up question was, "Anything else?", and you said, "No, that was all that I can recall", is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> That was your evidence.    Now I'd just like to refer you to your own application, your own application in paragraph 5 on page 93, it starts on page 92, where you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>"Phil Kloppers told us that he just came from a meeting and that the waiting is over and the revolution is going to start on that day, the 12th of December 1993.   Two weeks before the time we were already told that we should be on standby 24 hours because the revolution's going to start.   Phil Klopper put it clearly to us that General Oelofse wanted to see bodies and that we should fulfil hard options, and later Phil Klopper told us that General Oelofse gave instruction that we had to have a roadblock and during this roadblock we must also intercept weapons which would be taken into our towns in order to kill our people, farmers and children, and then we would use these weapons against the ANC, SACP alliance, as well as the PAC, and the leader of the AWB, Terreblanche, also told us at several meetings that we must cause chaos and make sure that the election on the 24th of April do not take place."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>	Now I find a few things strange.   The first thing is, yesterday you found the opportunity to reply to the answer to the advocate, "What was the instruction, was there anything else?", and you said, "No, I can't recall anything", but in your own application under oath you deal with all these instructions, and now this morning it was amended by saying that, "Later Phil Klopper told us that General Oelofse gave instructions concerning the roadblock".   Now I'd just like to know, the amendment which was made this morning, this "later", does this refer to later or by the roadside cafe, or later referring to when you left the roadside cafe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Later refers to Deon Martin's plot, and that's where it was said that we would set up a roadblock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> That's how I understood it, and this is where I have my problem, because if I look at Phil Kloppers' application concerning the same aspect and then I refer you to paragraph 17 on page 12 of the applications, I would like to read to you what Phil Kloppers said under oath in his application</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>"I arrived at 21:00 at the roadside cafe and Deon Martins brought the men to attention, and I told them that the waiting was finished and that the revolution was going to start landwide.   We were still at the roadblock.   I gave them the instructions General Oelofse gave me."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>	Why do the man who's in command of this group, according to his own evidence, why does he say under oath in his application that there at the blockade he conveyed the instruction of Oelofse, and this morning your advocate amended your application by saying later he gave instructions with regard to the roadblock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With all respect, Chairperson, my learned friend asked the question whether it was at the roadblock, he's not talking about the roadside cafe, he's talking about a roadblock, and with all respect my applicant testified yesterday that this instruction was given at Deon Martin's place and that's why the amendment was brought.   With all respect, it's all the evidence of Phil Klopper, but at Martin's house the instruction concerning the roadblock was given, and afterwards Deon Martin also testified and he amended his application in the same manner, so maybe my learned friend is not aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Mr Chairman, we are talking about the order that was supposedly given by Oelofse to hold a so-called "padblokade", I'm referring to that order, but according to the application of Kloppers, that order to hold such a roadblock was given at the roadhouse, whereas this applicant's application was amended this morning to read that later on, and he now indicated that that only happened at the house of Martin.   So my question is simply why would the person who had purportedly been in charge of this group state in his application that at the roadhouse already the orders of Oelofse were given through to the people under his command, whereas his application, the witness' application, has been amended this morning to state that later the order as to the holding of the roadblock was conveyed to them?  That's the simple question I'm asking, because that is also relevant in view of the application of Mr Van der Schyff which has been amended, because according to him, no such orders were given at the roadhouse, that is what I'm trying to get at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can I just ask you, according to you how do you understand the latest version as to where the order was given... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> As it pleases, Mr Chairman, first... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...at Martin's house or where?   Certainly not at the roadhouse, not at the cafe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Mr Chairman, if we read paragraph 17, page 12, the application of Kloppers, it clearly reads</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>"I conveyed to them the instructions General Oelofse gave me, and they knew that Oelofse wanted to see corpses, and I also..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>and then he carries on.   So, in Kloppers' version, he's clearly still at the roadhouse... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> ...and he conveys, but the application of this witness has been amended this morning to read that only later on they were informed, and he then explained that was at the house of Martin.   So all I would like to know is... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well when you put to the witness, you conveyed to him that according to his latest version the order was given only later at the roadblock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> No, no, no, I mean... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You should have said at Martin's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> ...concerning the roadblock, that what I meant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I meant concerning the roadblock, the order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Concerning the roadblock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> The roadblock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At Martin's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Yes.   That is so, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, with respect, the evidence of Mr Kloppers, it's his evidence that arose here before the commission, was clear that the order was given at Martin's plot.   So my learned friend ought to put both versions then, what's in his application and what Kloppers testified here before the commission, in fairness to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, I don't know whether we should really stop and check our notes, because we don't have the record, I told you yesterday that we are always the last people to receive the transcribed record, but Mr Prinsloo, I don't understand, are you saying that in his papers Kloppers says the order was given, he conveyed the order at the roadhouse, but in his evidence he says it was conveyed at Martin's house, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, according to the application, Kloppers say that he gave the order at the roadhouse... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> ...but in his evidence here, when he gave evidence, he clearly stated that he gave the order to the people at Martin's plot, his house, Martin's house with regard to the roadblock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I'm not sure about that, I can't remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> That is indeed so, I will confirm that on my recollection, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well how does that affect your question, Mr Dreyer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> It does affect my question, Mr Chairman, because I can even take it further.   On page 249 of the record, in the evidence of Mr Klopper, of Kloppers, it's stated as follows, and that is on the leading of his evidence by his advocate, I read from page 249</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>"ADV BOSMAN:  At this roadhouse did you tell them anything further about the order that you received?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>		MR KLOPPERS:  No, I did not tell them what the purpose of the work was.   When we left from there, it was clear that we had too many vehicles and I knew that, I knew I what our objectives was, we had to go and set up a roadblock as General Oelofse instructed me."</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>But what I'm saying is, that is clearly already a contradiction to Kloppers' own application, as set out in paragraph 17 on page 12, because there he clearly states in Afrikaans:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>"I conveyed to them the instruction of General Oelofse."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>Which clearly conveys that there at the roadhouse already I told them exactly what the orders of Oelofse was.   I can't see any other explanation.   But the problem that I have is that there's a constant changing around of the stage at which certain orders were given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But that's a different thing.   What Mr Prinsloo is objecting against is the premise on which your question is based.   You asked the witness the question on the premises that Kloppers said that he conveyed all these at the roadhouse in his evidence.   Mr Prinsloo says no, that's not the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> As it pleases you, Mr Chairman, (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What point you want to deal with these contradictions is of course up to you, but what I'm saying to you is that your question must be correctly premised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I will rephrase it, Mr Chairman.   Let's start at the start, because we don't want there to be any doubt.  Do you accept now, for the purposes of my question, I've read you a bit from the record which was testified by Kloppers and what he said in his application, do you agree with me that there's a difference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, if I can just say something, on page 12, Mr Kloppers there gave us certain instructions at the roadblock, he didn't give us all the instructions, he only said that there had to be bodies and that's what Oelofse told him, that the revolution is about to begin and that he gave us the weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Inaudible)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, at the plot at Mr Martin we were told that we have to have a roadblock.  So, Chairperson, all the instructions were not given at the roadside cafe, one was held back until we got to the plot of Mr Martin, and there that instruction was given to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I understand and I hear your explanation, but let's look at the logic behind your explanation, firstly referring to Kloppers' application, and once again I'm going to read this to you, it's paragraph 17</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>"At nine o'clock I arrived at the roadside cafe and Deon Martin brought the men to attention.   I told them that the waiting was over and that the revolution would start all over the country on that specific day.   I also conveyed to them the instructions of General Oelofse."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>And you are saying it's not the complete instruction, but let's go further:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>"They were told that General Oelofse wanted to see corpses and the pipeshot guns were also given to Martin, sir, and Visser, and I gave them instruction that we have to set up a roadblock."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>Now where in this application does it say that "we left there and then we went to Deon Martin's house and there I gave them instruction regarding the roadblock"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, there where he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>"I gave them instruction to set up a roadblock where people would be questioned",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>and that we'd also take the weapons and ammunition, this was said later to us.   Maybe it isn't put correctly here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But, sir, my problem here is, he goes further and he says, he gives the instruction regarding the roadblock, but according to his application you still haven't left the roadside cafe, because in the next paragraph, paragraph 18 starts with</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>"We had too many vehicles for the operation and we left some of the vehicles at Jaco Borden's house."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>Now it's quite obvious that you are moving away from the roadside cafe, and if I can refer or compare it once again with page 249 of the records, then once again it seems that they drove with the vehicles, because there were too many vehicles and this is not coherence with the evidence.   The application and the evidence of Klopper does not agree with each other, do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I do agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But that, because that's my problem, why are you taxing this witness about contradictions in Kloppers' case, why didn't you tax Kloppers himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Because, Mr Chairman, first of all, I didn't have Mr Kloppers' version on record before, because I only received the record yesterday, that is my first problem, so I couldn't go along and... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now what do you want him to do about Kloppers' contradictions in Kloppers' own evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Judge, all I would like to know is whether he, he also understand, or take it, that there's a difference between Kloppers' evidence on that point and his... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whether he accepts it or not, is immaterial to us.   We see it, even if he says it's not there, it doesn't matter, we see it, we don't need his evidence to confirm to us that there is such a contradiction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Mr Chairman, all I would like to do is, obviously from the evidence it transpires that this witness and the other witnesses got their so-called command from Kloppers, which purportedly got that from Oelofse, so I just want to draw the line through, if I may.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Maybe you should make the point you wanted to make, if your argument is that all this supposed shifting of ground and the like, well let me put to this witness, because we need to get somewhere, these contradictions, Mr Visser, is it not an indication of the fact that, firstly, Kloppers never mentioned the name of Oelofse as the person who had given the orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, Mr Kloppers did tell us it was coming from a group and that he received instructions and gave us instructions concerning what we had to do that night, he put it to us and he told us what to do, and that he received those instructions from Oelofse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now if that is what he said, why, at one time the name of Oelofse is supposed to have been mentioned at the cafe and the next minute he was not mentioned at the cafe as to the person giving the orders, but rather at Martin's place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, Kloppers could have held back some of that until we got to Martin's house and then he would have given the instruction to set up a roadblock, so I don't know why he didn't tell us everything at the roadblock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The mentioning of Mr Oelofse is it not just a mere fabrication?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm not, I don't understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, you tell us in your affidavit that Kloppers said that he had received orders from Oelofse, General Oelofse.   Isn't this not just a fabrication?   It's up to you to agree or disagree with me, but I'm asking you, because we need to make progress in this case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, I accepted and assumed that Kloppers received these instructions from Oelofse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Maybe Kloppers never even mentioned the name of Oelofse that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, he did mention Oelofse's name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Referring to your answer to the Chairperson now, you said that you assumed he received these instructions, you have no other confirmation that he did indeed receive these instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If he came from a group where orders were given, and this was at General Oelofse's house, then it must be obvious and logical that he had received these instructions from General Oelofse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But you believe so because he said so and he was head commander of that division and it's on that basis that you accept it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Just one further aspect with regards to the ear.  Evidence was given by Mr Kloppers that he would have received the instruction from Oelofse to cut off the ear, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I remember that he testified to that extent, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Yesterday when you testified you said that first when you were in the vehicle you heard that the ear was cut off, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> You only heard about this in the vehicle, the fact that the ear was cut off.   Now I would like to refer you to paragraph 19 on page 98 of your application.   Now this refers to a stage when you already left the roadblock and you were at the town hall at Randfontein and then you went to the house of Jaco Badenhorst, and I read you paragraph 19</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>"We all got together again at Jaco Badenhorst's house.   Therefore Klopper asked who shot.   The people who had weapons all confirmed that they did indeed.   Phil Klopper then showed us the ear of a black person and said that he would give that the next day to General Oelofse."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>	Now I would just like to know, yesterday you testified that only in the car, now this is before this that you hear about the ear, and now in your application you say that at the house of Jaco Badenhorst he showed you the ear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, what happened here was, at the scene I was with Kloppers, Martin and Diedericks now stayed behind with them, and when these things happened, and then when we were on our way home, when we wanted to drop off Diedericks, then he showed me the ear, so I did see the ear there, and I once again saw it at Badenhorst's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> So that was the second time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I understand.   Well let's leave it there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can I just ask something here please?   It's quite a horrid bit, this thing about the ear, where did you say you saw the ear the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In the car when we left the scene of the crime, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Where in the car was the ear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In a bag.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Wasn't it in the boot of the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> It was with you inside the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Just on the same topic, was it a shocking event for you, the showing of the ear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was a - I had a shocking impression.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But nowhere in your application you said that he showed the ear to you in the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If I saw it in the vehicle or at the house, I saw the ear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> All that I want to know, that you do agree that in your application there's no indication that you've already seen the ear in the motor car, but you only saw it at their house.   Then another aspect, on page 19 you say, I would just like to know, because the same contradiction appeared in the evidence of Mr Klopper and I would just like to clear that with you, I refer to paragraph 19 of page 98, you say there that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>"Phil Klopper asked who shot.   The people who had firearms confirmed."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>Do you understand that word, it means yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Well in both the evidence of you and Mr Klopper, I picked it up yesterday and yesterday you testified again that the people denied, and I thought maybe that I heard wrongly, and then you qualified it by saying, "I do not know if they were scared"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yesterday I said that they admitted or confirmed that they shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Dreyer, I think you misunderstood it, he said that the people were scared saying that they did not shoot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I wasn't very sure, I just wanted clarity on that.   I will put it to you, in conclusion, that no order was given to Mr Klopper, and as far as you believe that there was such an order, I believe that your action afterwards, or followed on that order, but I will put it clearer to you, the only reason why you believed you had an order or instruction was that because you believed that Klopper received such an instruction from Oelofse, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DREYER</p>

<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BRINK:</span> Mr Chairman, thank you.  Mr Visser, after the roadblock had been set up and you stopped these two vehicles, these people were taken out of the vehicles and as I understood your evidence, you said Kloppers and Martin asked them to which political party they belonged.   Did you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Did you hear any answer from the people being questioned about their political affiliation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I just want to tell you that the evidence will be that at no stage did anyone ask the people in those vehicles questions relating to their political affiliation.   I'm merely telling you that.	  Now is it not the truth that that night you people drank a considerable quantity of liquor, brandy and whisky?   In other words, you were quite drunk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, a bottle of brandy or a half a bottle of whisky is not a lot if you share it amongst nine people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Well was there a bottle of whisky and a bottle of brandy between the nine of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> There was at Mr Visser's flat a bottle of whisky, from which we drank, and at Mr Martin's house there was approximately half a bottle of brandy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Was that to give you so-called Dutch courage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>TAPE TURNED OVER - WORDS LOST</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Concerning the alcohol, can you remember that there was brandy at Mr Martin's house and it was poured into two bottles and it was mixed and that it was placed one in each car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I can remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you remember that one of the bottles was in one of the vehicles in which you drove?   Was that with Mr Kloppers and Diedericks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you drink with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, I did not drink from the brandy, or of the brandy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who else drank of it, because it seems as if just Mr Kloppers drank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I cannot say, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you definitely did not drink with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I drank the whisky.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, I'm talking about the alcohol in the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then it seems, as far as Mr Kloppers' evidence is concerned, that he only, he was the only person who drank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It seems like it, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And following on Mr Brink's question to you, you gave evidence or testified that at the road, or what happened at the roadblock, you said that the people was placed next to an embankment, Diedericks and Van der Schyff searched the vehicles, Kloppers and Martins questioned the people, questions was put to them regarding where they come from, where they're going, and you said, and also concerning the affiliation, and you assumed that they were ANC members, you did not hear them give the answer, but you only assumed it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, the people answered softly, you couldn't hear them, but I did not hear it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You only assumed it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Are you sure that questions was put to them regarding their political affiliation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was said to us that this will be the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I understand that, but I would like to know if you indeed heard that the question was put to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I heard the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now I want to know if you heard the question regarding the political affiliation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What was the question, or how was the question put to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The question was put to them, "From what political party do you...", or to what political party they belonged to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who was this question put to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I assume to all the people who were searched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you hear that at various times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If I can remember correctly, Mr Klopper stood in front of them and asked them, "To what political party do you belong?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he ask it once to each, to all of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It could have been more than once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he ask it individually?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It could have happened like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, I'm asking you as far as you can remember, because you said you heard it was asked.   Tell us what did you hear what was asked?   If you did not hear, if you cannot remember, you can say that, but if you did hear, I would like to know what you heard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, I heard more than once that he asked them what political party they belonged to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In a group, did he ask, "To what political party do you belong to?", meaning the group, or did he ask them individually?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I assumed that he asked it for the group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you said you could not hear the answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> You gave evidence yesterday that before this incident there was incitement at meetings by Eugene Terreblanche and where General Viljoen was.   You said that there it was told or said to you that there it was told or said to you that you will not allow that the country will be taken over, that you must arm yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> I do not know if I understand you correctly, but you said that you did not own a weapon?   Now that is strange to me, that you attend these meetings, it was said to you that there's a revolution on the way, that you must arm yourself, and you said that you did not have a weapon.   Why is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, I did not have money for a weapon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> This incitement or instructions, did you take it seriously?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And how did you thought, how would you take part in this revolution if you did not have a weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, that is why we used pipes, home-made weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And then the incident itself, you testified that "I assumed that they were from the ANC".   On what grounds did you make this assumption?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, when the group was formed, Mr Klopper said to us that this will be the target group, so I assumed that they told them that they were ANC/SACP alliance members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> So, apart from the fact that Mr Klopper indicated the target group, you did not have any other grounds for this assumption?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, none.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> On the same question, I'm sorry that I come back to this, how did you know that the target group had to be ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was said to us that the ANC/SACP alliance was the target group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When was this told to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was said to us at the roadside cafe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That the target was indicated at the roadside cafe that tonight it will be the ANC/SACP alliance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But nothing was said about the roadblock or how the target will be identified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> You had one of the pipe shotguns, is that correct?   I've got no technical knowledge about shotguns or a pipe shotgun, but how many rounds could one pipe shotgun take?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, a certain amount of rounds can be shot with a pipe shotgun, it has got a - you put the rounds in the weapon, the shot is fired, you turn it around, remove the shell and then fire again, so you can shoot a certain amount of rounds and then you cannot shoot any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> How many rounds did you have in that shotgun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Only one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Is there any specific reason why it was only one round?    Let's say it was necessary for you to shoot more than one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I did have more than one round with me.    Mr Chairperson, I could not get the shell out and that's why did not shoot off another shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did you notice amongst the people there that there was somebody who could have been in the age group 13?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, I saw children at the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> How many children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm not sure, I would say it was two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And were they also lined up for the purpose of being shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Were they in fact shot, or you may not know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, if they was in the line of fire, I would have shot them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> I missed my interpretation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If they were in the line of fire, I would have shot them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> I do not understand you.   Are you saying that they were not targeted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, I would not say that, Mr Chairperson, in a situation of a revolution or war, there's not a distinction between children, women and men, so if they were in the line of fire, I would have shot them or killed them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> So they were also lined up so for the purpose of being shot and killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Would you, in your view, regard them as legitimate targets, in terms of your objectives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, I saw it as follows:  if your parents are ANC, you will also grow up as an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Really?   Don't you know that in a multi-party democracy, the father can belong to party No 1, the mother to party No 2, the child to No 3?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> So I don't understand why you identified the child with the parents' political objectives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, I assumed everybody was ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> I see.   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Visser, just on this point, your own parents, to what political party do they belong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Currently, no party.   Before, I think they were CP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you ever a member of the CP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I moved in the right-wing area, so it was the Volksfront and the CP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you grew up and became an AWB member?   How does that then correspond with what you've just said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Like I said, Mr Chairperson, I assumed that they were ANC members, the same as their parents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prinsloo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Visser, did you see the AWB as a political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was a para-military organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And the members of the AWB, do you know to what political parties they belonged to or what they supported at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If they did not belong to the AWB, Mr Chair-person, they were either Volksfront or CP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But when they would have voted, what political party would they have voted for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You said the AWB was a para-military organisation, so they could not vote for it at an election, but in the politics they would have voted for the Volksfront, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And the CP, was it regarded as a good political party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Some would have voted for the CP, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you yourself, that evening, when it was, shots were fired at the roadblock, did you aim at a child, to shoot a child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, Mr Chairperson, I just aimed a gun at the people, I did not specifically aim at an individual.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I'm sorry, you'll have to explain that to me, let's say you shoot one shot and you aim at the people who is in one line, where do you aim then if you aim at a whole group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, a shotgun sprays, if you stand a few metres from them, the shotgun would spray, at the most, 10 to 12cm, so then I can say that I did aim at a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you see that's the point, that was the question that was put to you, will you answer that question again please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, that round could have hit any person there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Surely you could have only hit the person that you aimed at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It could be, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Well will you explain it to us, why you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, like I said, a shotgun sprays.  If I aimed at a person, it is possible that I did hit that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But I understood you that you could have possibly have hit one of the victims, rather than aiming at the group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, a pipe is an instrument that you fit in, so it is not necessary that you will hit the person that you aim at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How far were you from the person who you shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Approximately two metre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you really think that at a distance of two metre, with a pipe shotgun, that you will hit somebody else rather than the person that you aimed at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I could have hit him or either the person next to him or both.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you want to put any question as a result of questions that have been put (indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No thank you, Mr Chairman, I've got no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRINSLOO</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you, Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Your Excellency.</p>

<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Excuse me, I didn't get the amendment that you're making?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, it's page 108, paragraph 13, the sixth line from the bottom of that particular paragraph, insert the word "later" (indistinct) the word "ons", and delete the word "ons", and to enter the word "ons" between "het" and "opdrag", so it will thus read, "later het ons opdrag gekry".</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then also on page 107, Chairperson, paragraph 10, it says, "General Oelofse told us", or rather "command Klopper", it was told by Kloppers to the applicant, not Oelofse.    Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>	Mr Badenhorst, you were prosecuted in the higher courts of the Witwatersrand, Judge Marais, and you were found guilty on several charges of murder and other charges, and initially you received the death penalty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after the Appeal Court was, it was amended to life-long prison sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, Chairperson, I got 28 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Sorry, 28 years.   Mr Badenhorst, you joined the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And when was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> How old were you at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, I was 17, 18 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And at that stage, what standard were you in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I finished standard seven and then I went to the technical college, and after I did my N1 there, I went to work at Diesel Services.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But when you joined the AWB, you were 17?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you were busy with your studies then, or were you already finished with it then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, I was already finished with school then.  I finished standard seven, I think it was when I was in college or just after I finished college.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Badenhorst, why did you join the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, I believe in the ideology of the AWB, I believe that we can rule ourselves, that's the Afrikaans people, I believe we have our own culture, and we have the right to maintain that culture.   I also believe in own education and I also believe that we, as a nation, should be able to practise our own religion, and no-one should interfere with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You don't have military service yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was there any reason for you, did you want to receive military training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, when I was quite small still, I always wanted to be a soldier, and it was one of my great desires to go and fight in Angola, and also to be in the Special Forces, and I really wanted to be in the South African Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Before you could do it, the army retreated out of Angola and you couldn't do it anymore?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That's correct, Chairperson, there was a political change at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And in 1991, when you joined the AWB, was there any other thing that made you join them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, there were two incidents in 1991.   The first incident was that my brother in law, Johan du Plooy, went for his camps in Messina, his army camps, and during those camps, he and the men who were with him stepped on a landmine, and because of that he lost his leg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And the second incident, Mr Badenhorst?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, it was the battle of Ventersdorp, a good friend of ours, and also of my father, who also has the same surname as us, Andries Badenhorst, was there at Ventersdorp, there where the police fired on the white farmers because they offered resistance and they did not want that FW de Klerk could come and give a speech there, and during all that chaos, whilst the white policemen shot at the farmers, he was killed by a black taxi in the road, and the day thereafter, this convinced me to join the AWB, and the day after I did indeed join the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Badenhorst, when you joined the AWB and you fell under area 9 and the general in command was Japie Oelofse, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you receive training in the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, that's correct, since 1991, I often attended AWB camps and that's where I received most of my training by the instructors we had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What was the nature of the training you received?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> It entailed war techniques, the handling of fire weapons, self defence, etcetera.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did you also attend meetings of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, Chairperson, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you attend any meetings where the leaders, for example Eugene Terreblanche, addressed these meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did he have an influence on you, the leader now, Mr Terreblanche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, definitely, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Can you explain that influence to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> He specifically warned us against the fact that the election was on hand, this is now the '94 election, and that we, as "boere" or white people, did not have any chance to win that election because we are the minority.   He also told us from the stage that we have to make ourselves ready because a revolution was going to happen and there would not be a '94 election, it would not be held, and we will definitely offer resistance before a communist government would govern us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you have anything to do with matters concerning military instructions and that of APLA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes.   Inkatha, I was involved with training of certain Inkatha members, sorry, not APLA, it was also the basic war techniques, fire and movement, the handling of firearms and we helped to train them and we've tried to install some discipline into them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And was this the instruction of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you also provide defence and security for Viljoen and Terreblanche, Ferdi Hartzenberg, etcetera?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, Chairperson, that's correct, I was part of security at the meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were these open or closed meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Closed meetings, where only the leaders got together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And at these meetings were anything conveyed to you, what happened at those meetings, which you can recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, Mr Kloppers told me of some of the things which happened and were discussed there, and as far as I know Oelofse told him this, and that's how I got to know about this, and Kloppers then told me this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what did you understand from all of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, what I could understand from that was that the revolution was on hand and that it was going to take place in order to stop the elections, and I also heard that a great part of Constand Viljoen's supporters would help us, and that there's also a big part of the army and when there was enough chaos in the country, would also help us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was it also conveyed to you that a Volkstaat would be created and that certain towns and places would belong to you alone then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, not at that stage, at that stage, I understood that we had to stop the election.   There were plans to, I think the Western Transvaal, to make that our own, but what I understood was that there was definitely a decision to start the revolution.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Your parents, which political party did they belong to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> They've always been Conservative, and they always believed in ruling ourselves, otherwise they wouldn't have been Conservative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you supported that policy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, definitely, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And the policy, before the unbanning of the ANC, that of separate development, apartheid as it was known, did you support that policy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> It was the only policy I knew when I was growing up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Badenhorst, the 12th of December 1993, you received a call from someone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, it was from Deon Martin's wife, Louise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what was the purpose of that call?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> She told me - if I may just ask, can I use the word "roadhouse", because then everybody would get confused between a roadhouse and a roadblock - I was told that Deon gave instruction, I must go to the roadhouse in my complete AWB uniform... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Just in a lighter, I understand Commandant Martin's wife also spoke of the roadhouse in good Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, that's actually English.   I know I'm not very good with English, but... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You must go to the roadhouse then and you must be dressed in uniform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I must also take my fire weapon and I must wear my camouflage uniform, or I must take it with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Which fire weapon did you have at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Maverick "haelpomp".</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It's a shotgun, is it a shotgun that can shoot more than one round, more than one action?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That's correct, it takes six rounds, if there's also bullets, usually I only had five bullets, so that the (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you took this with you to the roadhouse, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Now when you got to the roadhouse, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> When I arrived there, most of the people were already there.   Commandant Phil Kloppers arrived the last of everyone, and when he arrived there, we were called to attention and we stood to attention, and Commandant Kloppers addressed us and said that he was coming from an order group where General Japie was, and that the revolution would start today, and that the time was ready, and that this is the real McCoy and the revolution would definitely start that night, the night of the 12th, and that bodies had to be shown for this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And General Japie, General Japie, who is this now, what's his surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> General Japie Oelofse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what do you mean when you say "real McCoy", what is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That this was the actual thing, that this was the real revolution that was going to take place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after this was conveyed to you, where did you go then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, all of us didn't have firearms, and Head Commandant Kloppers took two pipes from his car and gave one to Visser, Etienne Visser, and firstly Gert, originally Gert, Gert Diedericks that is, but I saw that Martin van der Schyff, at the same scene, also got the weapon in the place of Gert Diedericks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Do you know of any reason why Gert Diedericks would have handled the weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then Van der Schyff and Visser each received a pipe shotgun, and then he left the roadside cafe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct.   We had too many vehicles and we left some of the vehicles at my father's house.   They were on holiday at that stage, and at the same time there the Mercedes and the Nissan's number plates were changed with tape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> This was the Mercedes of Deon Martin and the Nissan of Van der Schyff, sorry, of Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That's correct, of Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And was there any alcohol at your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, not there, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And from your house, where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> From my house, after we left some of the vehicles there, we took two vehicles and we went to Andre Visser's house, or rather his flat, where, and there we drank whisky.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And yourself, did you drink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct, I did drink a glass.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> A glass?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Is that clean whisky or was it mixed with something else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I think mine was mixed with water, I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And the whisky you drank, did it influence you in any sense?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> After you were at the house of Visser, where did you go from there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> From Visser's house, we went to Commandant Deon Martin's, his smallholding, or his plot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what happened at that plot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> There Chief Commandant Kloppers told us that we're going to set up a roadblock and that we're going to look for illegitimate weapons, and there was also a blue light was given to Van der Schyff, Diedericks and Visser, because they would have been traffic officials.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after you were at Martin's house, where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, we left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Who did you drive with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I was in the white Sentra, together with Andre Visser, Martin van der Schyff, Kallie Meiring and myself, and Piet Matthew's, we were in the white Sentra, the rest were in the Mercedes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And the Mercedes, was it in front or behind you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> It was in front of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And while you were driving, was there any incidents taking place on the way there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, Chairperson, whilst we were driving through the smallholdings, two blacks came out of one of the plots and the Sentra stopped and some of the men jumped out and assaulted the black people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you partake in this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No.   Me and Meiring remained in the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And afterwards you continued?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, after they got back to the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And where did you go from there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> From there we went to the scene, Chairperson, Dora Crossing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And at the Dora Crossing, what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, there Meiring received the instruction to put us in specific posts or positions, considering the fact that he had experience with regards to roadblocks.   Me and Etienne, he placed us behind the chevron board.   Martin van der Schyff, Diedericks and Van der Schyff would have been the traffic officials, Visser had to place the blue light on the Sentra and made sure it worked, and Chief Commandant Kloppers and Martins would then drive out towards the Ventersdorp Road with the Mercedes in order to indicate to us the vehicles that we had to pull off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> While you were there, were vehicles stopped at that roadblock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, that is correct, Mr Chairperson, various vehicles, three or four, were pulled off, the vehicles were searched, the people were asked to get out of the cars, they were asked what their political alliances were.    One of the vehicles, a Ford, which was full of people, at one stage they did not want to leave and we got the instruction from Chief Commandant Klopper to push this Ford bakkie, and that we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was there something wrong with this bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, it did not want to start.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you help push?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Can you tell the honourable committee regarding the Honda Ballade and the other vehicle that was stopped?   I see that it is 11 o'clock, I do not want to, would you like to adjourn at this stage?   Can I continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Badenhorst, evidence was already given that a Honda Ballade and another vehicle was stopped at the roadblock.   Can you tell the committee what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairperson.   Commandant Martins and Chief Commandant Klopper had once again drove out with the Mercedes to Ventersburg.   When they saw a suitable vehicle, in this case two vehicles, they turned around to come back and flashed the lights, or brightened the lights, so that we know that the vehicles behind them must be pulled off.   Chief Commandant Klopper and Commandant Deon Martins joined us with the Mercedes, but the two vehicles was about 200 or 250 metres they pulled off the road and they just stopped there and stood there for a while, and at that stage Commandant Martin and Chief Commandant Kloppers were already with us and they warned us that it looked suspicious for these two vehicles now suddenly that they see a blue light to pull off the road, and they warned us to be careful and to be aware.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Afterwards they drove again, we were still at our different positions, they stopped, the people were asked to get out of the vehicles, they did it, the vehicles were searched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you take part in searching through the... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Etienne Visser and I stood for the whole time behind a chevron board which was next to the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So who searched, or the vehicles were searched?    And the occupants were, or sat next to the vehicles, was that an instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And how did they sit, did they sit in a row, or in a group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> There was an embankment, and it was a type of an embankment where they sat, otherwise they would have been uncomfortable, so they sat on the embankment next to the Chevron board.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Continue, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, certain questions were put to them, as with the previous vehicles, where they come from, where they're going, what political party they belonged to.   Chief Commandant Klopper would tap someone over the head with a baton, because they clearly saw that we were from the AWB, we had our signs and clothes and uniforms on, and clearly they saw that the people were not very happy, and logically they were, or they had some resistance, they were resistant, and Mr Klopper just tapped them on the head to pacify them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you hear what they answered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, I did not hear to everyone, or listen to all the questions, but I did hear that it was said that some of them belonged to the ANC, but I did not hear what everybody said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, Meiring and Visser at one stage with the Mercedes drove back there where the vehicle stopped approximately 250 metres from where we were, to go and look if they maybe have dropped something off next to the road or if someone maybe, or someone is maybe hiding next to the road, but they came back and said that they only found a bag of ice or something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did they take anybody with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, they took some of the black with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> If you say Visser, are you talking about Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> It's Andre Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was Andre Visser, yes.  And did they bring that person back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, they bring that person back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after that occurred, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> After they came back, Commandant Deon Martin and Etienne Visser called us from behind the chevron board and then we formed a group, where he put it clearly to us that these people were the enemy, they were ANC members, and that this is the target.   He said that he will give the command shot, after which we must fire as well, we must shoot at the black people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, we formed a line, Commandant shot, fired the first shot, and then we all fired our weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you see it as an instruction or as a request?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Naturally it was an instruction or an order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you shoot at the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> How many shots did you fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I fired five shots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after you fired at the people, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, someone shouted that there's a vehicle on the way, but because originally it was me and Etienne Visser's duty to remain behind the chevron board and look out for vehicles that could come from either way, in any case then someone shouted that there's a vehicle on the way, and some of us whose adrenaline was rushing and who jumped into the Sentra, it was Martin van der Schyff, Andre Visser, Piet Matthew's, Kallie Meiring and myself, and we drove away, but before we left, Chief Commandant Phil Kloppers shouted that we must wait for them at the town hall, and we also did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At the town hall, what did you do there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, then we waited for Chief Commandant Klopper, Commandant Deon Martins, Gert Diedericks and Visser, who remained behind at the scene, to meet us at the town hall, because it was said that we must meet them there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Where did you go from there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> We waited there but they did not arrive, and from there we drove back to my father's house and we waited there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did some of the other people arrive there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, that is correct, after a while everybody arrived except Gert Diedericks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At your house what happened there when everybody was together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Each one was asked who shot.   Everybody said that they did shoot, those who had firearms.   And someone was asked to go and get a bag from the Mercedes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I'm sorry, Mr Prinsloo, everybody said they did shoot, those who had firearms.   Who was there that did not have a firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Gert Diedericks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> But he was not there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You said someone was sent to go and get a bag from the Mercedes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I do not know who was sent, but in any case, Chief Commandant Phil Klopper opened the bag and showed us the ear of a black man and he said to us that this ear will be taken to General Japie Oelofse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you then disperse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, everybody went home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Afterwards, what did you do, did you openly walk around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, Commandant Kloppers said that we must lay low and that we mustn't be seen with each other or in the company of each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Who said that you must have a low profile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Commandant Phil Kloppers on behalf of General Japie.    It seems that if this instruction did come from Japie Oelofse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> If you say Japie?,</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> It's Japie Oelofse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Now on the 15th of December, sorry, the 16th of December, did you attend any festivities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, I was at the Voortrekker Monument with the Day of the Covenant festivities, I was there in uniform.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, we were congratulated by General Oelofse and they asked us to also form a guard of honour for the leader and his generals in staff during the festivities there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> On the 6th of January 1994 were you taken into custody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were you detained according to article 39 of the Act, were you detained separately or with the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Separately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At that same day, on the 6th of January, did you make a statement to a police officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct, yes.   I did not want to, but I was forced to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The statement, honourable Chairperson, begins on page 185 up till page 190.    After you were exempted from the acts, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, with the other applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> General Oelofse, was he also detained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, that is correct, it was regarding bombs that went off also during that period of the festivities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did General Oelofse talk to you or spoke in general?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> While he was there with us, he, at various times, praised us and congratulated us with what we did.  He said that it was part of the struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was anything promised to you while you were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, he gave us medallions.   General Japie Oelofse promised us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And during December of '95, did someone visit you at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, that is correct, the leader, Eugene Terreblanche and certain of his generals in staff came to visit us in Johannesburg Prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What was said to you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, Mr Eugene Terreblanche said that all the "boere" participated and if they did, we would not have been in jail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And at any stage did you receive any promotions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, I did, I was now lieutenant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Lieutenant in which section of the AWB, are you a member of the "Ystergarde"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes.   Originally not, but after that day I was promoted to lieutenant in the "Ystergarde".</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And this "Ystergarde", how are they seen in the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> They are seen as the elite of the AWB Special Task, especially to protect the leader and some of the generals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You've already heard evidence where posters were made with some of the leaders' faces on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> And that they said that they also made a placard or a poster with my face on it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was that for the release of you and the other group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Gentlemen, can we adjourn now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I beg your pardon, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can we adjourn, is it an appropriate place to adjourn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> As it pleases the committee.   Certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Until half past eleven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a>	When you acted on the specific day, the 12th December 1993, did you do it for yourself or on behalf of someone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, I did it for the organisation, it was an instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Which organisation is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> It's the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you gain any benefit from this?</p>

<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you do it out of malice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, Chairperson, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And the application which is in front of the committee, do you confirm the contents thereof?</p>

<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR KNOETZE:</span> Mr Badenhorst, except for the Honda and the Cressida, how many other vehicles, can you specifically remember, which were stopped by you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, three or four vehicles, that's excluding the Cressida and the Toyota.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> For example you referred to the F100, can we accept that there were two or three more?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Could you hear what was discussed with the people occupying those vehicles by Martin and Kloppers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I could hear what the questions were that they asked the occupants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Could you hear if they were asked with regards to their political affiliations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, that's correct, I could hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And what did the occupants of the F100 say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I couldn't recall exactly what the occupants of the F100 said, but all those who were driving were not of the ANC or ANC/SACP alliance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Did you accept that, because they were allowed to go on their way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, yes, the instruction was ANC/SACP alliance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> If I understand it correctly, you didn't really try to hear their answers on these questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Could you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> I assume that you did not specifically tried or made an effort to hear what the blacks who were stopped said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, I didn't listen to each and every word that was said, but what I did hear as what I said before, what the questions were and the answers which Chief Commandant Kloppers and Martin received.   With regards to the other vehicles, maybe they had nothing to do with the ANC/SACP alliance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> But as you already indicated, you assumed, and in your, that you did not really hear the answers, but your assumption is made on the fact that Kloppers let them go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I know that, that there were Inkathas who were stopped, but I cannot tell you exactly which vehicle that was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> The point I'm trying to make, Mr Badenhorst, is that I find it quite strange that it was so important to find a target that you didn't pay specific attention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, the questions were asked by Chief Commandant Martins, as well as Kloppers.   I left it up to them to find the appropriate target, considering they were the people who were asking the questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> But now, according to your version, you are going to commit a crime, you are going to kill somebody, but yet you do not make sure that the individuals you are going to kill do in fact belong to that specific political affiliation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, I was a soldier, I respected the ranks of my higher officials, and I did not doubt them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> The ridiculousness of your answer is that you did not doubt them, but all you had to do was to listen there at the scene, all you had to do was listen, and the point is your answers indicate that you did not listen with attention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I wouldn't say all the time, but I did listen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> You see, Mr Badenhorst, the result of your evidence, and this coincides with that of my client, Mr Van der Schyff, it is that there was no question about you looking for a specific target of ANC/SACP affiliation people would then be shot, it was not part of the planning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is not correct, Chairperson, why did we let some of the vehicles go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> He would say that it was because they did not find illegal weapons with them, and that was your task, and that's how you testified in front of the committee before we had the tea adjournment, that on Martin's smallholding, Kloppers said that you're going to have a roadblock and that you're going to look for illegitimate weapons - please do not interrupt me - that was your task?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Are you finished?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Yes, I'm finished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, I said that the revolution, and it was put to us clearly at the roadblock that the revolution was going to begin and we were "boere" and our enemies were the SACP/ANC alliance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> But in your evidence you did not say that at Martin's smallholding a roadblock would be held, we are going to look for illegitimate weapons and we're also going to find appropriate targets which would consist of SACP/ANC alliance people and that we are going to kill them, it was never said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> It was supposed to be have said at the roadhouse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> What are you saying now?    Are you now saying to the committee that at the roadhouse it was said that, "Tonight we are going to kill SACP/ANC alliance people"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> If I left it out, it's my mistake, but it was said to us at the roadhouse that the target would be the ANC/SACP alliance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> If you now put it so pertinently, you're the first person who said that because no-one else did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Well sir, that's how I understood it, because it's logical that the enemy of the "boer" were the ANC/SACP alliance, because it's them who threatened us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> It's another problem that I have with your evidence, you said that at the roadhouse you were told the revolution starts, the time is ready, it's the real McCoy and the general wants to see bodies, but you never said that the general wanted to see bodies that same evening, that's not part of your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> As far as I can remember, my evidence was that the time was ready for the revolution to start.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> It would seem to me that those statements are very general statements which were made, it was never said that specifically tonight people had to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That was not our instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> In any case, you already know that my client would deny that those things were said.   He'd also deny that it was said that the revolution would start, it was the real McCoy and the general would want to see bodies, it was not said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is your client's evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> It would seem as if the idea to kill people was one that was formed once you've already started the roadblock and now suddenly it was decided to kill people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, sir, I don't agree with you.   At the roadhouse it was said that the revolution is going to begin, and what is a revolution other than to kill people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> This is not coinciding with the evidence of Klopper himself, who said to the committee that according to his command structure, or that he would not always say what would be the task right until the last moment, and the task was held back up until Martin's smallholding and then that you would have a roadblock and that you would want weapons, and that's all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, I do not agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And my client will also say that the other groups of people who were stopped were not asked what their political affiliations were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I do not agree, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> But you can also not explain to the committee why you cannot remember what the answers were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> The fact that we let some of them go, I think is a good enough explanation, it's because they were not ANC/SACP alliance people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In all respect, he said that some of them were from Inkatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Sorry, I did not hear the objection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The evidence of the applicant is that he said that some of the people answered and said that they were belonging to Inkatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> That's true, but he couldn't hear all of them, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With all respect, Chairperson, you have to take into regard that he stood at the chevron, you must take his position into consideration and maybe my learned friend is leaving that out, he's not stating what this applicant's position was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Mr Chairman, will you just allow me one moment please?   My instructing attorney has indicated to me, Mr Chairman, that I incorrectly put to this witness that it had never been said by Kloppers that they would shoot the people there that night already.  At page 385 of his evidence, in answer to cross-examination by my learned friend, Mr Dreyer, he said, "Already at the roadhouse, I told them that `Tonight is the real McCoy, our target group is ANC/SACP members, if we find them we will shoot them'", but even so, Mr Chairman, that is not the evidence of this witness in his evidence in chief.   I have no further questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KNOETZE</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR DREYER:</span> Mr Badenhorst, I want you to understand this very well.   Some of the previous witnesses are saying to you, the same as pain is a subjective experience, if you come and tell me you've got a back pain, there's no instrument that I could use to determine whether you really have a back pain and I have to accept your word for that, is that correct, and in the same sense I cannot look into your heart to see what your political or religious convictions are, is that correct?   I accept what you are telling me and therefore I have no reason not to believe that you are telling the truth if you say that in 1993, as a 20 year old man you were under the conviction that the communistic system was a threat to your people, I have no problem with that, I cannot deny that.   I can also not deny that you were influenced by speeches of the AWB leaders and other right organisations.   It was accepted that Terreblanche is a</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a>very charismatic speaker and that he could incite people.   Now I return to what you've said concerning that night.   You said that night at the scene you said that the adrenaline was flowing, is that correct, at the road block itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, no, that's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> So you felt whipped up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, and we were quite tense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Ja, that's what I wanted to say, because it goes further, in your application, also in the application of the previous witness, it was said that after these two vehicles stopped and then pulled away, everybody was very militant and they were ready, and they were also very tense?</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That's correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> So there's more attention put to what might happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> It looked very suspicious, and we were warned against that, that we had to be careful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> And if I look at your application, it would seem already the fact that you did not only draw a line between politics and communism, but also with regards to religion, in paragraph 4?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> The religion I then practised and which I still practise today is not the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Well what I want to say is that you referred that at that stage it also came down to your religion as well as the politics, you really saw communism as a threat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, definitely, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> And at that stage you were 20 years old and you saw a person who submitted to you and he is the Chief Commandant of that area, you considered yourself a soldier and also saw yourself as under the command of this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> And you say at the end of your evidence during cross-questioning by Mr Knoetze, you said that you respected the ranks of him and Martin and you had no reason to doubt their word?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> And when Mr Kloppers told you, "I received the following instructions from General Oelofse", you also respected Oelofse as a very important man within the right-wing organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, yes, definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But you never received such a direct instruction from Oelofse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, not directly from Oelofse, but through the channels and the way we worked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> And my question is simple, you did comply to those instructions because you believed those were the instructions given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But for any other reason, if you thought that there was no such instruction, would you have continued on your own, on your own initiative?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> And if Mr Kloppers, for whatever reason, was under the same conviction as you, if he did not convey these instructions correctly or if you misunderstood the instructions, what would your comment then be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, if that was the case, we would not have known, because we only received instructions from Kloppers and we followed them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Mr Knoetze asked you, and he made a statement and said that it seems as if these instructions were more general statements during that time which were said at meetings and it was said in general that something had to be done, we cannot allow that an election is held, because it's going to be disadvantageous to our people, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> And I'll return to two other things you've said.  You said afterwards you were praised by Oelofse and I don't want to do this with every witness because I do not want to waste time, I just want to make sure, when you were at the festivities you said that you were called in order to stand an honour of guard, guard of honour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That's correct, we were asked to stand guard of honour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Isn't it more correct that there was a call-up, that AWB members who were completely dressed in their uniform, because everybody was not dressed in AWB uniforms, that these members must stand a guard of honour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That can't be, because there were thousands of them in uniform.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But what I would like to know is, is it your version that you specifically were singled out to do the guard of honour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That's how I felt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> And was it only the people who were part of your group who formed the guard of honour, or were there other people as well in uniform who formed the guard of honour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> There would always by "Ystergard" members in their black uniforms who were responsible for security.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> So you weren't the only ones who formed the guard of honour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, but we were singled out from thousands of others to form the guard of honour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But my statement is, you were not the only ones who formed the guard of honour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, yes, basically we were, because the "Ystergard" men were there for security.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I put it to you that it is not the case, and I'll leave it for argument, as far as it would be necessary.  Just one other statement, you also said that later, while you were in detention, certain promises were made regarding medallions, etcetera.   At the end of the statement you were asked where they came from and your recommendation and you said that you thought it came from Oelofse, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, I said it came from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But then I heard you incorrectly, because your voice trailed off.   If I can just return.   In conclusion, in different stages or phases during your application, etcetera, certain amendments were made and through evidence that was given certain corrections were made, where and when and what the order was, through the different people that testified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> According to me, Mr Chairperson, according to my knowledge, this is exactly how it happened and where the orders came from at the roadhouse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Let us make it applicable only to you.   You are the second witness, your application was amended with specifically with the allegation that you only heard later that these instructions came from General Oelofse, so you are the second person today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> That is what I mean, we would probably never know precisely what order was given where, because enough has been said about that in cross-examination, but I would like to take you back to your statement that you made on page 187, specifically the beginning of it, page 186, that is now after the initial printed statement.    The following said to this statement</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a>"Captain Van Vuuren said to me that, `Your father said that..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a>or it looks like:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a>"...that you will not make a statement'."   What is your answer regarding that?    I want to make a statement and speak the truth.   It does not help if I hide things.   I feel sorry for what I did."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a>Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes.   I can give a reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Okay, what was the reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I was attacked by the police, and my father in the presence of that time Captain Van Vuuren, said that I must not make a statement before I've got a lawyer present, and I was attacked by the police to provide them with certain information.   At that stage they already knew almost everything that was said in my statement, because I was the last person who was picked up by the police, and at that stage they knew more or less what everything was about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I accept what you said, because I do not carry any other knowledge regarding this to deny it, but you would surely not, in the beginning, make such a decision lightly, because it's clear that your father didn't want you to make a statement at that stage, but you did decide to make one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I did not have much of a choice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I do accept that, but all that I'd like to know is that we have heard your version today about where and when this instruction was received, and I understand why you said why you executed this order.   On page 187 of the same statement, at the end of the last paragraph, there they talk about the roadhouse</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a>"We planned to pull off a taxi."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a>My copy is not very clear:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a>"We had to search for weapons.   We made this decision at the roadhouse.   In other words the shooting as well."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a>All that I'd like to know is that you say "we made that decision there".   Now if you say "we made that decision", to who do you refer to, who's this "we"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, at the time when I made the statements, really I thought today I was a bit scared giving evidence here, but under that extreme pressure that was placed upon you in the police station, there's so many things that you say that doesn't make sense, which is not logic, and that is also the case here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I'm not, I still remain what I said to you, I'm asking, must I understand it that when you say "we decided", is that "we" as "we the soldiers", or "we" according to the instructions that you've got from your commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, there it should have said that we as a group, through Chief Commandant Kloppers, received an instruction or order that on behalf of General Japie Oelofse, but I just in short spoke here to finish.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I understand you, if you say "we decided" and "we planned", then you would not have planned it or decided, because you did not have the rank.   The person who gave the orders was Kloppers.    Furthermore in the statement it says, this is now at Martin's smallholding, "after we discussed this plan in detail", is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, that is where the plan regarding the roadblock was mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> And once again you accepted that this is now the execution of order that was given by Oelofse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Now I asked Mr Kloppers this question and he said that he knows Oelofse and he knows Oelofse's background and he's got respect for him as a military person and he's not someone who would do something in a random way.   All that I would like to know is, why would it have been necessary for him, I'm not talking about you, he is the commander, why would it have been necessary for him to work out a detailed plan as a person with a military background like Oelofse have already given the instruction, then there would have already been a planning stage, why is it necessary to plan further?</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I cannot answer that, that is something that General Oelofse will have to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Is there any reason why, that you can give, why it is not possible that this whole plan of a roadblock and that must happen there was not a creation, or that was created in the mind of Kloppers and that there was never an instruction, is there any reason that you can give that there isn't... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He cannot answer what went on in Kloppers' head, he can speculate and say anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think maybe the question should be rephrased... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I'll do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...and put to him in the more conventional way.   I mean ask him, would you dispute the fact that Oelofse never gave such an order to Kloppers, or would you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, as I said, I trusted my commander and everybody who had a higher rank than I, I never doubted their word, and I don't think there's any soldier who would do that.   They must trust their higher rank.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Look, it is actually being put to you that Oelofse denies that he gave such an order to Klopper, but on the other hand, Kloppers told you that Oelofse did give him such an order.   What is your comment there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, I was not in that order session, so I don't know what was said there, I only executed my orders that was given to me by Chief Commandant Kloppers, I was not in the orders group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I didn't want to put in the final word into your mouth, but I thought you would tidy up your answer.   So you would neither agree nor disagree with any one of them, because you were not there when the order was given, the supposed order was given to Kloppers, you were not there?   You can't say Klopper is lying or Oelofse is lying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I don't know.   That is a question that must be put to Kloppers.   I don't believe that he... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I do not believe that he lied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chief Commandant Klopper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So Oelofse would lie to us if he says that he never gave the order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, I wasn't there in the order group, how can I say that he lied or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well give us now your final answer regarding this scenario, it is very easy.   Mr Badenhorst, the question is very simple, Mr Dreyer says that Mr Oelofse allegedly never gave such an order.   The question to you is, can you deny that, is it possible for you to deny it or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I am not, I cannot say if it occurred or not, because I wasn't there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson, just a last question.  I understand you're not in a position to deny it or not because you were not there and this matter has been cleared up, this whole thing that occurred, you were under the impression that, through Kloppers, that a national revolution will begin on the 13th of December or the 12th of December, and when it was the 16th of December and you were at the festivities and you heard there that nothing came from or happened regarding this alleged national revolution, did you not then started to doubt if such an order was given?   Can I qualify it, did you not then doubt that such an order really did come from Oelofse, because nothing else happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, at that time various bombings occurred in that same period of time, and I believed that it was still continuing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Do you know when the bombs went off, and the same question was asked to Mr Klopper and he could not give a certain date when certain bomb attacks occurred and he could not say if that had something to do with the revolution.    If I may have misunderstood him, Mr Chairperson... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I am also not sure if it happened on that specific day, but I remember that in that period, it did occur... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> That is what I would like to know... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> ...and the atmosphere was still definitely that of a revolution.</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But you, at least at the 16th, on the evening of the 12th or the morning of the 13th, that there was not a full-scale revolution in the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, I realised that it has not started as we thought it would.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But the fact of the matter is that Phil Kloppers said to you on that evening of the 12th that the time is right, that the revolution is going to start, and not when, but tonight, and we're going to start tonight, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> And all that I'm asking here, by the 16th you saw that it has not realised, did you not then started to doubt that at one you may have been misled or misinformed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, not really, because like I said, the whole atmosphere of revolution was still prevailing throughout the country during that period, and during that period various bomb attacks did occur.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DREYER</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BRINK:</span> Mr Badenhorst... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Can I just help him with his - because he said he cannot hear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Is what I'm saying being translated for you into Afrikaans?   All right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Now, do you agree with me that at that time it was common knowledge countrywide that the AWB regarded the ANC with extreme antipathy, in other words hated the ANC and the ideals for which the ANC stood?</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, definitely yes, because they were a threat to us, and as I said in the committee, there was no chance, if all the whites stood together for that election, that there would be any chance to win the election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> No, but the point of the question is whether you agree that that knowledge was countrywide, I mean everyone knew what the AWB's attitude was towards the ANC?   I mean it's on television, on radio, in the newspapers, speeches of Terreblanche, the country knew what your attitude was and what you stood for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> What I understood was that it would occur countrywide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> It would have happened countrywide, but that the population at large knew that the AWB regarded the ANC with antipathy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Ja, I would say that it is apparent that it was the fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> And that the AWB regarded the IFP, at that stage, as an ally against the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Definitely, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> And you had told us that on that evening at the roadblock, vehicles were let through because the occupants in those vehicles had said they were IFP, or belonging to some other organisation which was not ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> And we know that on that night you were all wearing your AWB uniforms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> And on the AWB uniforms, on the shirtsleeves, was that large, what Eugene Terreblanche calls a triple seven, but a type of swastika, black on white and red, very prominent?   Whatever it is, you know what I mean, a very prominent, well-known sign or emblem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, the triple seven was on our uniform as well as the then commando's sign.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> And it was a well-known symbol or an emblem?   You were very prominent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> And I want to suggest to you that, having regard to the fact that the ANC would have been frightened of the AWB, because of the AWB's public utterances in regard to the ANC, it would have been extremely unlikely for any occupant of any motor car to have admitted to you that they were supporters or members of the ANC on that night, extremely unlikely?</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Well, I do not believe that it could be the matter... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Come, Mr Badenhorst!   We know from your evidence that there was this well-known antipathy on the part of your organisation against the ANC, it was well publicised, and are you telling this committee that there'd be no problem for people to admit to you, dressed in your AWB uniforms, that they were members of the ANC?    They would have expected trouble from you, isn't that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Well, Mr Chairperson, it could be that they expected trouble from us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> But do you think it likely that these people would have admitted to having been members of the ANC, knowing that you were AWB people there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I cannot answer on behalf of them, they must give their own evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Well they will say no questions were asked of them and no admissions were made, that they were callously and brutally shot.   What's your comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Just tell me once again, how much did you have to drink that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, at Andre Visser's flat, I had a glass of whisky, and that some evening at Commandant Deon Martin's smallholding, I also drank brandy, and that is the brandy in which he gave the evidence, a half a bottle that he shared between the two vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Are you aware of the fact that theft was committed at the scene of this roadblock, money, watches, if I recollect correctly shoes, a tape set, or tape player?  Are you aware of the fact that theft took place that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, I only realised at the town hall that some of the items was stolen, and that is the first time I saw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes.   Bear with me, Mr Chairman?   There were children amongst the people who were shot, do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, I did see young people, or the one you could say was a young man, then I also saw a younger one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> What was the point of shooting these youngsters?  Couldn't you have showed some mercy towards them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, the instruction to us was to shoot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> You see, I'm going to suggest to you, Mr Badenhorst, you and your group had had far too much drink that night, that appeared at the trial, had far too much to drink and you just went out on a murderous, senseless spree of random killing, a purely racist approach, nothing to do with politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, that amount of alcohol that I drank, I did not, or I was not drunk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> And the answer to the second part of my question?  It was just a senseless, murdering spree, nothing to do with politics, pure racism because these people happened to have black skins, that was the only reason you did this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, Mr Chairperson, that is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BRINK</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In the statement you made to the police, which you did willingly and voluntarily, and which was against the advice of your father...</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a>TAPE TURNED OVER - WORDS LOST</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a>...you made the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, you said what I did voluntarily, I did not do it voluntarily.   I was assaulted and I was forced to make a statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But it's said to you by Captain Van Vuuren that your father said you should not make a statement.   What's your answer to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That's correct, Chairperson, my father told me in the presence of the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you also tell us that the reason why you did it, one is because of the assaults, but also because the police already knew everything, because they spoke to the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you had nothing to conceal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, at that stage they already knew everything at that stage, after they interviewed and interrogated the other men, and also because they had made statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So at that stage it was an honest version of what you thought happened that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, I wouldn't say it was honest, I wouldn't say this is the truth, because I left a lot out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, with regards to what you said, there's nothing you said here that you lied about, with regards to what you can remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, as I've said, there could be mistakes in this statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you remember any mistakes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> With regard to this specific one, the one where I said at the roadblock, let me just make sure where exactly this is written - sorry, Chairperson - I can't see what I was thinking about now where there might have been a mistake, but I did make mistakes in this statement, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But please tell us which mistakes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, the fact that it was said at the roadblock that we're going to pull off taxis, that was not the truth.   What it comes down to here is that firstly we would go to General Martin's smallholding and there planned to have a roadblock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And if you say that's not the truth, why did you say it then?   Is there a reason why you did not tell the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, at that stage, really, you were scared there, and the people are assaulting you while they're questioning you, and then they show you how Kloppers looked after he was shocked and he was tubed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, I'm talking about when you were writing, you weren't assaulted while you were taking down a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And to speak in specific details, you start and you talk about the party that you had during the weekend and the fact that one of the people stayed over at your place, and then the Sunday afternoon you were tired and you went to bed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, but that's got nothing to do with the case.   It was unnecessary to even say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> My question is this, does it have nothing to do with the case or not, because you said Kloppers and his wife and their children, Visser, Martin and others, you can't remember all of them, all of them had a party at your house, "Visser stayed over at my house", and the question I would like to ask is, did you drink during that party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, to be honest, I cannot tell you if that party was the night before, or it might have been at a more previous occasion.   I cannot really tell you if it happened the night before or if it happened before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> It is quite obvious then that your memory then must have been better, because this was taken down a few weeks after the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, I wouldn't say my memory was better then, I was very confused and I was scared when I made this statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But your memory isn't any better now either?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> It's a deliberate remark.   You said that at the roadhouse, you said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a>"At the roadhouse we planned to pull off a kaffir taxi and to search the people for weapons and then to shoot them."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a>And later you talk about something and say that the plan was once again discussed in detail.   Why would you make the distinction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> As I've already said to you, Chairperson, at the roadblock, sorry, no I'm getting confused, at the roadhouse we were told that the revolution was about to begin that night and that it was the real McCoy and that there should be bodies, and at that stage nothing was said to us concerning how we'd go about it, that was all we were told, and the question with regards to the roadblock was only discussed at Deon Martin's smallholding in detail, and about how we'd go about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, I've heard that, I just want to know why it doesn't coincide with the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Now - I explained it to you now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can I take you back to two other things?   Firstly, when you shot at the crossing, firstly you testified with regards to the training and also the training you've given, the handling of weapons, firing and moving, and you also said you stood in a line?</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you decide who was going to shoot at who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, Chairperson, every person, no-one was told who to shoot, we just shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you stand in a line, and I assume behind the people or in front of the people, where were you, before or... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> We were standing in front of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you stand in a line and they're sitting in a line, and the amount of people are ten victims, or there are ten people sitting there and nine people shooting, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> We did not assume that you would stand across from a specific person?    You said they sat next to each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, it could be the case, Chairperson, but I cannot say who the others shot, it was a very confused shooting and I do not know how to describe it.   When the first shot went, everybody started firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you stood in a line, is that correct, and they sat in a line, that was the evidence of everybody else?  MR BADENHORST:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And according to your testimony the distance you stood from them was about two metres.   Wouldn't then one make the assumption or can you not remember that you must have been standing opposite a specific individual?</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, it is so, we stood in front of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you obviously would have shot at the person sitting in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> If you think about it logically, yes it had to be like that, but I cannot tell you if that was in fact the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If you stood in a line, because this is another question, you would remember that the evidence at the trial was that the shooting just simply started after the first shot was fired, it wasn't a line, it was unexpected, there was evidence to that effect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, we stood in front of the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Also in your evidence you used, and you said that Kloppers rapped the people on their heads and you said some of them were tough?</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you even smiled when you tried to answer that, because you were looking for understanding, you said that they helped them along?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, Chairperson, they were tough.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> They didn't co-operate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, they didn't co-operate, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But how does he rap them?   Did he not assault them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, I don't know how to describe it.   In the prison I see much worse things than that.   He walked behind them and say, for example, they gave him a sarcastic answer, he hit them with the baton on the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He hit them with the baton on the head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, rapped, or hit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And then just one last question with regards, you made a statement to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Because you were scared you were going to be assaulted again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But they don't tell you what to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, just before I made the statement, they took me to a little office where Chief Commandant Kloppers and Martin van der Schyff were already sitting together with the detectives, and at that stage I still said I know of nothing, and only after Kloppers and Van der Schyff were asked, "Was this man, Jaco Badenhorst involved, was he present?", and then I realised, and they said yes, and then I knew that they already spoke to the police, and that's why I made this statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The point I'm trying to make is, in this statement, you did not refer to the role of Oelofse, you did not refer to his name and it was also not done at the trial.  Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> In order to protect certain people and also to protect the plans of the organisation as I understood it, and to keep it under cover, and to protect those plans, so it doesn't come to be known.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you deliberately protected Oelofse when you made this statement to the police, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr Badenhorst, this expression "the real McCoy" is not a typically Afrikaans expression?</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, it's not.   It's the true McCoy,</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> But there are many Afrikaans people who would not know this expression, "the real McCoy"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That could be the case, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> I find it quite strange that all of you knew what the real McCoy meant?   Was it a general word used within the group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, Chairperson, it is a general word, you hear it on the TV a lot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Where did you learn this expression?</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> It's a general expression, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Your parents were on holiday at that stage, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Where were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> In the Cape, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Were you worried about them when this revolution was at the point of breaking out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, I was worried.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Did you contact them and tell them that the revolution is going to break out, that either they must go home or they must make sure they're safe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, Chairperson, I did not say anything of that kind to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> But you really believed that this country was going to be engulfed in a complete revolution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, I really believed that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> You also said that the religion you practised then is not the same as you practise now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.   At that stage, how can I say, I was not really involved in a specific church.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> May I ask to which church you now belong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, I'm an Israeli, the Israel Truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Has it had any effect on your political sentiment, with regards now the political connections, the religious connections you have?   So can you say that you've remained unchanged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I'd say that my ideology and that, what I reach for, cannot be changed, because I can see what's happening to our nation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Are you still a member of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> As far as I know, if Mr Terreblanche did not chase me away, as far as I know I am a member of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> With regards to the guard of honour, did I understand you correctly that "Ystergarde" was automatically part of this guard of honour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, they performed a specific function for the AWB, and they gave a show, and behind the stage where the leader, Terreblanche, and the general staff was sitting in a semi-circle, there were members of the "Ystergarde" and we were not part of that semi-circle, we stood at the back of the general staff at a wagon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Were you called to join this semi-circle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, Chairperson, we were never part of the semi-circle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> But was this then a compliment to ask you to stand guard of honour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, for me it was a compliment, otherwise I would just have sat on the steps.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And are you saying correctly that Oelofse specifically asked you to form a part of this guard of honour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I'm not quite sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Who asked you to form a part of this guard of honour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, we still received all our instructions from Kloppers.   Yes, he told us to stand a guard of honour and he said that was organised by General Japie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> But when you were there at the Voortrekker Monument, did you automatically go and stand at the guard of honour, or did somebody specifically call you to come and stand there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, no, when we got there, we found Japie Oelofse there, because he stayed at the same caravan as us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> But that's what I mean, what was Oelofse's specific participation as far as this guard of honour is concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> As far as my knowledge is concerned, it was suggested by General Oelofse to Kloppers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> I think we're missing each other, Mr Badenhorst, you said that you found Oelofse there at the Voortrekker Monument?</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And it was on my - referring to my question as what was your participation with the guard of honour, why you had to stand there, etcetera, because if I remember correctly, Kloppers was not there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, he was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> So let's start over.   You're there at the monument.   Before the time Kloppers told you that Oelofse indicated that you must go and stand a guard of honour.   Now is there a specific moment when somebody comes to you and says, "Look, we're going to have the guard of honour there and you must go and stand there", who gave you those instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I received all my instructions from Chief Commandant Kloppers and Martin, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> I just want to clarify one aspect with you.   When you made the statement to the police when you were arrested, did the police tell you what to write, or did you write what you knew?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, they said to me, or they guided me in what I must say, if I could put it like that, like what my, or as my lawyer said, they also guided me in what I must say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> How could they have guided you, what did they - in respect of which aspects did they guide you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Chairperson, almost everything that occurred or happened from the roadhouse, they basically said to me that the other people have already said that, or told them about it, and I just repeated it and they just wrote it down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Okay, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prinsloo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Mr Chairman, may I just, before Mr Prinsloo re-examines, just one question in relation to a question put by the committee member, Mr Malan, as well as Sigodi, pertaining to the... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As long as you are not going back to asking... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, why, if you, how can you still be thinking of protecting Oelofse if you knew that you were already arrested, the revolution did not take place, why was it still necessary at that stage, because you spent a lot of time on that thing with regard to the main witness?   If you are going to go back to that aspect, I could say to you that I think that has been reasonably covered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Mr Chairman, all I... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You wanted to go to that point which I suspect you're going to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> No, I would like to ask a question in relation to a question that was put by the committee member, Mr Malan, as to the way in which the statement was structured at the police station and the involvement of the police there and then in relation to the possibility of Oelofse being protected or not.   That is the purpose of the question that I intend, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, if it is not the point that I think you wanted to go to, because I think you spent 1 1/2  days around issues like that with Mr Kloppers, and I really think that you should go back to spend that time again with this witness.   Firstly you had the opportunity to put questions to the witness, which you did, you didn't cover that aspect if you want to, I don't see any reason why you didn't do that if you wanted to, you've been having that statement.   I just don't see any basis why you didn't put questions to the witness about that, and at any rate, this whole question of the statement, the witness says he was forced by the police to do that.   How do you know that that is not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, I don't... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We want to be careful about the statement.  We don't want to find ourselves committing unnecessary irregularities about this, unless somebody's going to call the police to say that he's lying if he says he was assaulted or pushed into making this statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Mr Chairman, obviously I can't put into dispute that there was any kind of undue influence on him, that's his statement, that's not relevant to my question.   All I wanted to know was whether there was a reason for him to omit something in a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well let's see what you're saying, but you have heard my concern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> As the Court pleases, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR DREYER:</span> Mr Badenhorst, all that I'd like to know is, if I understand correctly that you went into the small office and there were two people there, Kloppers was there and Van der Schyff was there, together with the detectives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> And if I understand you correctly, your viewpoint at that stage was that, "I'm not going to say anything", but then you saw and you make the conclusion that they have already spoken or told them the story?</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But you did not have their statements in front of you, that is now Kloppers' or Van der Schyff's statements, so that you would know what to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, Mr Chairperson, but we did, before they arrested us, we already had a cover story in case we would be arrested... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I understand what I want I want to say and - I've got no further questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DREYER</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Badenhorst, when you went to the Voortrekker Monument for the festivities, how did you get there, did you go with Chief Commandant Kloppers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, Chief Commandant Klopper and Commandant Martin was there already a day before the festivities at the Voortrekker Monument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Badenhorst, at the Voortrekker Monument, the "Ystergarde", were they in their uniform, the black uniforms, the "Ystergarde", and you were in the ordinary AWB uniform, so you were easily distinguished?</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> When you were detained, was it before that you were detained according to section 29 when your father said that you must not make a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, they arrested me in Bothaville, or picked me up, and from there took me to the Protea Police Station in Soweto.   My father drove with the detectives and went with me into the police station, into the same office where Captain Van Vuuren and other detectives were present, and he said to them, or he said to me that I must not make a statement, that he first wants to get a lawyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after that we were detained according to the Act of Internal Security and you did not have access to any person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And when you were detained according to section 29, did you have a choice to speak or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Repeat the question please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> When you were detained according to section 29, as it was explained to you, did you have a choice to refuse to give information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, I did not have much of a choice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you say you saw Chief Commandant Klopper there.   Did he have a normal appearance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, he was definitely not normal.   His face was swollen, he could not walk, you could immediately see that his muscles were contracted because of the shocks, his whole face was swollen, it was blood red, and you could see that they did something to his face.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At that stage when you were arrested, you said you were the last person, did you know or did you not know that General Oelofse was also detained regarding this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, Mr Chairperson, he was not detained or arrested regarding our matter, but he was arrested concerning bombs that went off just before or... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you know Oelofse was not detained because of your case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, I knew that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you at any stage take an oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What did that entail, that oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Loyalty, that everything that you do, you do it for the "volk".</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That oath of faith, could you then implicate other people, for example a commander or other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And during the interrogation of the police, as you were the last person, could you then gather from the interrogation what was said by the others, or what was alleged by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> I could gather from what was said by the others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I would like to refer to Exhibit C, the charge document, as well as the name of Oelofse that appears in this document, according to this charge docket there was an explosion, on page 9 of that charge docket, it is charge 2, there was an explosion on the 15th of December at the Voortrekker Monument, do you know about it, did you hear about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, like I said, I did not know exactly when the bombs exploded, but it was during that period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Just a moment please.   At the guard of honour that was formed at the Voortrekker Monument, where the leader attended, what was the function of General Oelofse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> He was part of the generals in staff, and he was, or during the leader's speech he was with the leader on stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRINSLOO</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Dreyer, Mr Prinsloo saw it fit to ask the witness a question about whether, in terms of an oath, he was free to incriminate other members of the AWB, and why he chose to ask this question only now at this stage is beyond me, but it may very well be that it could entitle you to put questions to this witness around that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, I have noticed that that is (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It may very well be that he has in fact incriminated other members of the AWB to the police, and that would entitle you possibly, if you so wish, to put questions to this witness around that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> As the Court pleases, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR DREYER:</span> Mr</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a>Badenhorst, I understand what you said and it's clear that you do not know the oath word by word, but you know that this oath entails that you do everything for "volk" and "vaderland", and you do it to further the goals of the movement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, that is what it's about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But you made a conclusion from that that it's also expected from you that you will not incriminate other members of the AWB, and especially commanders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But if we look at this oath, did you not, in that declaration of that oath, refer to Mr Martin and Mr Kloppers, they are your direct commanders, they are your direct commanders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> At that stage they have already been arrested, they have already made their own statements, so I did not incriminate them, they have already incriminated themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But you did not see their statements, so you do not know to what extent they incriminated themselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, Mr Chairperson, the detectives beforehand said that I was the last person, all your friends have said or spoken.   I did not believe them until Chief Commandant Kloppers and Van der Schyff told me that they know everything, that I can talk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But if they said to you that they know everything, why didn't you not, at that stage, because you know it wouldn't have helped, why didn't you make use of that opportunity to, and then say that Phil Kloppers said that he received the order from Oelofse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, I can understand it, like I said beforehand we knew what we are going to say if we were arrested by the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DREYER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you think that, because these other people were arrested, you should no longer abide with the oath that you had taken, and then incriminate them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, I took the oath, or I did not violate the oath, because I did not incriminate anybody else or made known a name, and all the other people have already incriminated themselves in this case and I knew that they've already made a statement, because the police told me that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well it is one thing to mention the name of somebody, it's quite another thing to incriminate him.   If you're incriminating him, you go on to telling the police or the Court what he actually did and so on and so forth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, at that stage I could not remember what each one did at the scene of the crime, it was finer details that I could not remember under the interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Mr Badenhorst, for the second time you referred it and the first time I did not follow it up, you said that you made these statements beforehand and you all agreed on what you're going to say, you talked about a cover story that you all agreed on.   What was this about, did you plan to lie and what was the plan to lie about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Mr Chairperson, according to me it was to protect certain people and not to make known the plan of the revolution.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Are you saying that the cover story at a previous discussion that you were free to say everything except to name Oelofse, because everything was said except Oelofse's name was mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> No, Mr Chairperson, everything was not mentioned in this statement of mine.   What was not made is regarding the revolution that would have started and the resistance that the "boere" would have given, or... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> So that is the part that you would not mention, the part about the revolution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Yes, that's the part that I did not say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are not having any further questions, are you...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...via me?   Mr Badenhorst, thank you, you are excused, you can stand down.   You can stand down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR BADENHORST:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, I see it's almost one o'clock at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, well we have... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I don't whether you're going to have the lunch adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well let's go on until - let's see how far we can go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I beg your pardon, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let us proceed and see how far we can go.   We are getting worried that we will not be able to finish this matter unless we accelerate our pace.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The applicant, Mr Andre Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">ANDRE FRANCOIS VISSER:</span> (confirms to speak truth)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is this (indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR PRINSLOO:</span> Apart from this one, there's one more from my side, Mr Diedericks, then Van der Schyff remains for Mr Knoetze.   	Honourable Chairperson, on page 60 of the application of this applicant, I would like to make an amendment.   It's paragraph 4 of page 60, approximately seven lines from the bottom, it says that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a>"The real McCoy is..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a>and it must be put in there that:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a>"...we will start to work, `ons moet begin werk'", and later at Martin's house an order was given to set up a roadblock."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a>	Then page 61, paragraph 6, the word "ons" must be deleted and "Van der Schyff and I", or "ek en Van der Schyff" must be put in there, that is page 61, paragraph 6, "ons" must be replaced with "ek en Van der Schyff", "ek en Van der Schyff" must be inserted.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Are you referring to page 61, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Just the word "ons" must be deleted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then it's substituted by words "ek en Van der Schyff het na Jaco Badenhorst se huis vertrek", it remains the same, just the word "ons" to be deleted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Visser, is it correct that with regards to this specific case you were arrested by the police and prosecuted in the High Court, together with your fellow applicants, and you were found guilty to several charges of murder, as we can see in the speech of Judge Marais and you got the death sentence?   Is it also correct that later the case was taken back to the Appeal Court and you were given another sentence?   What was that sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Lifelong sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And now you're applying for amnesty with regards to all those charges?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Visser, did you join the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And with regards to the date when this act was committed, when did you join the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> About a week, almost two weeks before that incident took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And at that stage you did not yet have a uniform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Commandant Kloppers, do you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, we worked together for 18 years at the gold mines, so we knew each other well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Who recruited you to join the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Kloppers himself recruited me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did he convince you to join the AWB, or how did you join?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, he convinced me it was the right thing to do and that there's problems within the country and that it would be a good thing to join the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At that stage, were you known, did you know what the principles were of the AWB and what they stood for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, he taught me and he told me what the AWB stands for and what their ideology was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did you agree with all of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I did, completely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And for whatever reason then, you joined the AWB.   Was there another reason why you joined the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The election was coming, the country did not experience a good climate, it was a difficult climate, and I decided to join the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you have certain fears?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I feared that the Communist Party would come into power and that then, that it would be very difficult then, once they've taken over the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So did you want this take-over to take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, no I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were you in the army, did you receive military training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, in 1971.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did you fight at the border or was it internal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, it was internal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what you experienced in the army and what was conveyed to you by the then government, did you support the policy of the then government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I was always NP, up until the early 90's, and then I became a CP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Because already then the NP was busy giving our country away, therefore I joined the CP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Visser, I would like to take you to the 12th of December 1993.   Did somebody come and see you at your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, this Sunday evening I was at home.   I woke the morning, so I was on standby, and then Klopper came to me around seven in the evening and he told me that he came from an order group, and he'd meet me at the roadhouse at nine o'clock and then we were called up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were you told to bring anything with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I didn't have a uniform.   He told me the clothes that I was wearing at that time was good enough, I could come in that, and he told me I should bring my weapon.  I had a 765 Bredalli (?) pistol.   At nine o'clock I arrived at O'Harry's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And here at the roadhouse, who were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> At that stage me and Kloppers arrived there the same time, there was also Commandant Deon Martins, "veldkornet" Meiring, Commandant Van der Schyff, Commandant Visser, all of them were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Visser, at that stage, in the capacity of Kloppers, did you regard him as a friend or did you see him in the capacity of a higher official?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> At work we were friends, but when it came to the AWB affairs he put it to me clearly that he was Chief Commandant and that I'm a Warrant Officer, and that it's the same as it is in the Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you respected him as an officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Completely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And at this roadhouse were any instructions given to you which you can remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.   Chief Commandant Phil Klopper arrived, as well as Martin, and they brought us to attention and they saluted.   At that stage I didn't know how to salute, but they saluted and then Klopper spoke to us and said that he came from an order group and that he received instructions and that specific evening we would go out to work and that General Oelofse gave instructions that we had to start working, the revolution was about to begin, and that we had to work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were you told at the roadhouse what was expected of you, what kind of work were you to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> They said hard options, they did not mention then that we would set up a roadblock, but they talked about hard options and that there are going to be bodies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were all of you armed, all of you who were at the roadhouse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, everybody was not armed, and pipe shotguns were distributed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Do you know who received this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Van der Schyff received a pipe shotgun, he was with me in the car and I saw that he had a pipe shotgun, and Visser, but at that stage I did not know the guys and I could not identify them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You said you saw a pipe shotgun in the car when Van der Schyff was sitting with you in the vehicle.   Did you see when he physically received this weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You did not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But you saw a pipe shotgun in the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, he had it with him then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And Van der Schyff, the other applicant, was he with you in the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, there were only two of us in one vehicle. MR PRINSLOO:  And that's how we amended it in page 61, paragraph 5 in your application.   Mr Visser, where did you go from there, you and Mr Van der Schyff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We, together with the other vehicles, went to the residence of Badenhorst.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you have...</p>

<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a>...what happened to this belt with the bullets in it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Van der Schyff took it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what did he do with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He put it around his body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then you went to Badenhorst's residence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what Mr Badenhorst's house, what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We changed the registration plates or the numbers, mine, and Kloppers asked me if he could use my vehicle.   I said that's fine and we changed the registration plates with masking tape and then he asked me if I had liquor in my flat and I said I had a bottle and he asked if we can drink it and I said that's fine, we can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then you went to your residence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, we went to mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did you use alcohol there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.   The bottle was no longer sealed, but I poured all of those who wanted a drink.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What kind of alcohol was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was First Watch whisky.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after you drank the whisky at the flat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Then my alcohol was finished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you drank the whole bottle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Maybe I should have put it differently.   Afterwards, where did you go then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Then we drove to Commandant Deon Martin's smallholding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And were you told anything at the plot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, we were told that we are going to set up a roadblock and we had yellow jackets and a blue light, all the equipment you'd need for a roadblock, also torchlights, etcetera, all of this was distributed to the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And at Mr Martin's plot, did you drink anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I do not drink brandy, there was brandy, I did not drink it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did the others drink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.   I cannot say exactly who drank brandy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Just with regards to this, at that stage some of the people were unknown to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Most of them were unknown to me, the only one I knew was Martin Van der Schyff and Chief Commandant Phil Klopper and Commandant Deon Martin, I only knew him for a few days, that's all, all the others were unknown to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And from there you went to another place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.   We drove, we followed the Mercedes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you drive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I was driving my own vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did anything happen on the way there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.   Two black men, it could have been three, who were walking in the road, they had bags, I cannot say exactly what, and somebody told me to stop.   I stopped.  Some of the people got out of the cars.   One of the pedestrians ran away.   I ran and I followed him, I chased him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what happened now with regards to the people who were running away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The one ran away, jumped over the fence, ran into a maize field, and I went back to the Sentra.   So my Sentra was busy leaving without me.   I took out my weapon and I shot two shots into the dirt road and they stopped and they waited for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why did you shoot two shots into the dirt road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I was scared they will leave me there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you made sure they'll stop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.   They were too far away to shout.   I went to my car then, and the person who was behind the wheel got out and I drove on myself.   He sat at another place then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then you went to the Dora Crossing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, we followed the Mercedes Benz to the Dora Crossing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> There we were warned, me personally, by Commandant Martin, Commandant Deon Martin, they must have reported to him that I fired two shots, and he said to me that in the future I must only act according to his instructions, and he placed me under the command of Meiring, and I would be involved with the handling of the blue light.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> This is at the roadblock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, this is at the roadblock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So a roadblock was set up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, it was set up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you manned the blue light?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I did, I switched it on and off when I was told to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What happened at the roadblock, just in broad terms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well they decided that the Mercedes would go, would drive to see which cars we'll pull off, so that we don't pull off just any car, in other words when he comes back, he'll give us a sign with his lights, and then I would be given an instruction to turn on the blue light, and that's how we did it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And were cars pulled off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, vehicles were pulled off.   I cannot tell you how many, it could have been three, four, I cannot remember exactly how many were pulled off, but after the blue light they were pulled off, as they passed, they were pulled off, as they passed they were pulled off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Are you aware of the fact that the vehicles stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, a van, a pick-up with a canopy, I'm not sure whether it was a Chev or a Ford or what it was, but, and they helped him to - the car broke down and they helped him to be on his way again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> There was evidence of a Honda Ballade and another car which was stopped at the roadblock, can you just tell the committee how it happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The Honda and the Cressida, at that stage we didn't know what vehicles they were, but first the Mercedes came and then he stopped suddenly, and Kloppers said that the next two cars, we had to pull them off, then I switched on the blue light, and as I switched the blue light on, they were a while away from us, and they both pulled off, both vehicles, for a few seconds, not for a very long time, they once again moved into the road and came closer and stopped again, and where they were pulled off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I was still at the blue light, I assumed that they were asked questions.   The people got out of the car and they sat on the embankment next to the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was there an instruction given to you to switch off the light?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, the instruction was given to Meiring.   We went to Kloppers and Martin and we received instruction to see why the two cars pulled off before, to see if maybe they've dropped something off, these were one of the occupants of the car, I'm not sure if it was one of the Cressida or the Honda, I cannot say with certainty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You said this was you and Meiring?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.   We took the person, put him in the Mercedes, went back to where they stopped the first time and all we could find was a little bag with ice inside, which was busy melting, next to the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you do anything to that person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I asked him, he didn't want to answer and I assaulted him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> How did you assault him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When we got there, we got out, then you're a bit scared, because the maize is really high, anything could happen.   I took my weapon out and I was ready in case there was danger.   When we saw there wasn't danger, there was ice lying there, I asked the man questions, he didn't want to answer me, and I hit him with the weapon, with the flat side of the weapon I hit him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And afterwards, did you take the man back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We took him back.   I made him sit down again at the edge, as they were sitting on the embankment, right at the beginning, on the edge, and Meiring then told Klopper, or reported to Klopper, concerning what we found, which was only a bag of ice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then you took, you returned to your position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.   Meiring was already on his way to the Sentra and I saw he was on his way to his Sentra and my last instruction was to stay with him, so I went back to the Sentra.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you see that those vehicles were searched?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> There were people at the vehicles, the boots were opened, I cannot say who searched the cars or who did what.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after you'd taken up your position, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I was almost, just before I reached the Sentra, I heard shots and the people were shot at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you form part of the group who were shooting, or were you not part of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, I was not part of that, I was on my way back to the Sentra.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you shoot at anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.   Did I shoot at someone?   No, not at all, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after people were shot at, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It happened very quickly.   I cannot say who shot and who they shot at, these were the people sitting on the embankment.    Meiring then shouted that a car was coming, I jumped in the Sentra, so did he, and then the others came running, "veldkornet" Badenhorst, Peter Matthew's, as well as Van der Schyff, they jumped into the Sentra and we left the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And just before you left the scene, amongst the group of people that were sitting on the embankment, did you see children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> How many?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I think I saw two, I'm certain I saw two children, I saw them when I went to get the man to take him back to where they stopped before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then you went to the town hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what happened at the town hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We got out of the car, first we just sat there, and then somebody said, I can't remember who, that they feel a bit uncomfortable in the back, because there were three of them in the back, I have to open the boot of the car.   I could see there were things in the car that were not there before.   I opened the boot and I saw that Piet Matthew's had cassettes there and tools, and there was a leather jacket.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Do you know who handled the leather jacket?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Van der Schyff handled the leather jacket and Matthew's had the cassettes, and he gave the equipment to Kallie Meiring, the tools.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What did they do with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Kallie said that "veldkornet" Meiring said that he's going to take the tools and take it through the channels.   I took the tapes, the cassettes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> To listen to it, to find if there's something about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Meaning what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> To listen to it, if it was music or maybe messages.   That was the instruction that I got.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Afterwards, where did you go then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I then took the people back to Jaco Badenhorst's</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a>house, because the Mercedes did not come.   We waited for approximately five minutes.   The car did not arrive.   I was worried and I took them back to Jaco Badenhorst's house.  I then went back to the town hall.   I must have missed the Mercedes, because I waited there for a while longer and then I went back to Jaco Badenhorst's house and there the Mercedes was with the rest of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chief Commandant Kloppers was angry because we left the scene.   They did not have ammunition to shoot more, I don't know what, he wasn't, he was angry, he wanted to know how many shots each person fired.   No-one argued with him and said it would have been a wrong thing to do, then I would have been a victim as well today, no-one argued and then someone went to the vehicle, I don't know who, he brought the ear and he showed the ear to us and said that is the trophy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You did not shoot at the scene of the crime?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Is there anything - or did anything else happen at Badenhorst's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, we then dispersed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> During that time, afterwards did you go to the Voortrekker Monument?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I was called upon to go to the Voortrekker Monument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you have a uniform then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, I did not have one.   I bought a uniform there to form a guard of honour for the leader of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With your co-applicants, did you stand in this guard of honour at this parade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Who inspected this parade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The people who I saw there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who looked at the people in the parade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I was under Commandant Martin and Chief Commandant Kloppers, although I saw General Oelofse there, but I wasn't part of the discussion and of rank, so I couldn't take part in the discussions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And the leader, Eugene Terreblanche, was he there as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> After this parade that was held at the Voortrekker Monument, on the 6th of January you were arrested by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> After you were arrested regarding the Act of Internal Security, and after you, and then you appeared in court, were you detained then in the Johannesburg Prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> While you were detained there in the prison, was General Oelofse also there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you have any discussion with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, in a group, I mean if we're not in court, we do talk about how things are going, how the case went, etcetera, and he said there for us, where I was present, that we should receive medals for this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Medals for what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> For what we did.   He referred to the roadblock incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you then receive medals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you get a promotion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I was promoted to - it can be that you can become a "veldkornet".   Chief Commander Kloppers also received a promotion to a higher colonel and then a brigadier later on.   He promoted me, I then became a commandant, and General Oelofse approved it and he signed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you receive an appointment certificate and you said it was signed by General Oelofse, do you still have the certificate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, unfortunately not, when I resigned from the AWB, I destroyed all documents regarding the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The other people who were promoted, did they also receive certificates?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was there, during December of '95, was there a visit by certain officers of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The leader, Eugene Terreblanche, with Mr Oelofse and there were some other people of the generals in staff, as they were called, they came to visit us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were you addressed by Terreblanche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.   He said to us if everybody did what we did that night, then this country would not have been in trouble.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> This action of you that evening of the 12th December 1993, did you do it for yourself, did you do it on behalf of someone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I did it on behalf of the AWB and for what they believe, I did it as a soldier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And when did you resign from this movement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> On the 5th of December 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> While you were in the Johannesburg Prison, did anyone praised you or congratulated you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> During what period, because I've been in Johannesburg/Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> While you were detained in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When we were waiting for the case, General Oelofse said to us that we are going to receive medals, we did the right thing.   The leader at one stage visited us, or at various times he did come and visited, he never asked us, "What did you do wrong?", he always created the impression that what we did was something that he approved of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At that specific evening of the 12th of December, when Chief Commandant Klopper gave you the order, did you at any stage question his order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.   No, I know him from work, he was the main, or the chief trainer of the production worker and before he came to me and he presented certain facts and I did not question anything he said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRINSLOO</p>

<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR KNOETZE:</span> (First part of question not interpreted) ...and then you continued... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may have to start all over again.  You may have to start all over again, because there was a technical problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> I'll do so, Mr Chairman.   Mr Visser, you testified, and I wrote your words down as you spoke, and you said that at the roadhouse Kloppers said to you that General Oelofse said, "We have to begin to work"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And the way I understand Afrikaans, that means it's something that's got to happen immediately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, we would have started that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> But then you continued and you said that the revolution was going to begin.   Did you testify to that extent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And the way I understand Afrikaans, it means that it's something that's in the future.   You did not testify in front of the committee that Kloppers said to you that Oelofse said that the revolution starts tonight, that's not what you said, but that's how I remember it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm not going to argue with you that that were the exact words, I cannot remember the exact words, but that's how far my memory allows me... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Or your conscience allows you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, my conscience is clean, that's what I can remember, that's what happened that evening and I'm trying to remember it as closely as possible as how I saw it that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> By this time you already know that my client, Mr Van der Schyff, would say that he did not hear that it was said that evening that "the revolution starts today"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Further, you also refer to the hard option, and he will say that he did not hear that either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And then he also said, which is quite interesting, "there are going to be bodies".   You did not say that Kloppers said that Oelofse said that he wanted to see bodies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Kloppers said "there are going to be bodies"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's how I said it, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Maybe you understood that there are going to be bodies when the revolution starts, whenever that might be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Maybe I could not distinguish what Oelofse said, because I wasn't present when Oelofse gave these instructions, I accepted that all the instructions came from General Oelofse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> I think you're missing the point.   The point I'm trying to make is, your statement that "there are going to be bodies", can you link that with the revolution which was still going to take place?   Aren't we talking about something that's going to happen in the future?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, I was aware of the fact that the revolution would start that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And as you know, Van der Schyff will also say that he did not hear that Oelofse said that he wanted to see bodies that specific night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KNOETZE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR DREYER:</span> I want to start at the same point where my friend started with Mr Van der Schyff, it is from a different angle.   You already confirmed that you said that what you heard from Mr Kloppers at the roadhouse was that the general said that "we had to start working", but at that same point you did not elaborate precisely about what the general then said to him, what this work would entail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, he didn't say anything else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> He said the revolution was going to begin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I was under the impression, and he placed me under that impression, and it's still my impression, that it was an instruction which he received at the order group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> It's just important to me, as it was to my predecessor who asked the questions, I wanted us to take it in a chronological order, when you were asked at the roadhouse, said at the roadhouse that the general said that you had to start work, you were not then also told what the general said this work would entail, not at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was in that same discussion at the roadhouse, yes, but I might be wrong as far as the chronological order is concerned and how I remember it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> You see, that's exactly where I'm heading at.  Just because maybe there was a misunderstanding as far as you were concerned with regards to what formed part of the general's instruction and what formed part of the instruction Kloppers gave you, and so maybe there also could have been a misunderstanding with Kloppers with regard to the actual instructions of Oelofse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I did not received instructions from Oelofse, I got it from Chief Commandant Kloppers, and those instructions which I got from Kloppers, where he said, and he said that he came from the general and I accepted it like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Let's say differently, let's put it differently.  I'm probably going to say the same to you as I said to the previous applicant who testified, I accept that you executed what you believed to be an instruction, but if there wasn't an instruction, then you did not follow an instruction of Oelofse but only that of Kloppers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, personally, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Let's look at it from another angle, you are saying that he said that the general said, "We must begin to work".   Now you testified that you did not do service or whatever, but you had army training in 1971, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> And in the time when you received military training, surely at one point or another, except for the fact that you had to run around a lot during that time during the army, surely you must have been exposed to the principle that there was a rank order and structure, and that you do not act unless you receive instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> In your time when you were exposed to the military milieu, were you ever placed in a situation where somebody gives a very vague instruction, or in your military time were you used to the fact that if the corporal who was then head of the battalion you were part of, if he wanted something to be done, he'd say that you go there and you do this, and then you'd do that and then you return, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Yes, then you do not question a higher rank's instruction.   All I want to know is, do you agree with me, Kloppers did not tell you "Oelofse said begin to work", and if I say "begin to work", it means go and do that and that thing, it wasn't conveyed to you in that manner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.   He said he came from a group, order group, and you must remember I did not know Oelofse, but Oelofse said the following, I cannot tell you exactly what he said, maybe my words differ from the others, but that's how I remember it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> No, I don't want to be unfair towards you, not for one second do I expect of you or any other person to tell me exactly what somebody told you in 1993, let's forget the precise words, let's accept your version and your memory concerning these words might differ from the other applicants, but what I would like to know is, do you agree with me that you did not receive a definite and complete instruction which then would have come from Oelofse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> The second thing I would like to learn from you in opposition to the other applicants, and once again it's your choice of words, but you said that Kloppers told you there are going to be bodies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, he said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> The other applicants, or the other witnesses, or the evidence of other witnesses is completely different and more according to the line of Oelofse said that he wanted to see bodies.   Do you agree with me it's not quite the same?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But do you stick to the fact that what you heard from Kloppers was that there's going to be bodies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I might be wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But do you stick to your version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, that's how I remember it and how I convey it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Now, and to also, with regards to the questions already asked you, if it's said to you that there's going to be a revolution, did you link that to possible death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, because revolution means to rebel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> At any stage did anyone tell you, whether it be at the roadhouse or at Martin's house or wherever, maybe on the way to the scene where you would have had the roadblock, the purpose of the roadblock would be to look for firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Let's turn the question around then, I'm going to leave it in your hands, you tell me as you remember it, what was the instruction that you got from Kloppers with regards to what the instruction of Oelofse would have been with regard to the purpose of the roadblock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> This happened at the plot.   We were told that we're going to set up a roadblock and the purpose of that roadblock would be to find weapons, that as well, to find weapons and he gave us the blue light and we received the instruction that we are going to set up a roadblock.  I was aware of the fact that people might be killed in the process, otherwise we wouldn't have had weapons on us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Okay, let me ask you in this fashion, the fact that a security official who works at the bank and who makes sure that there are no illegitimate things happening, the fact that he goes to the bank with a weapon, because that's his job, we know that a burglary or a robbery might take place, then he must do his job and then we can accept the fact that because of the fact that he's got a weapon, he might accept that there are definitely going to be a robbery, people are going to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Then I'd like to apply that to this situation.  The fact that you were told that there are going to be bodies, that evening when you left the roadhouse in the back of your mind did you believe, "It doesn't matter what happen tonight, but tonight there are going to be bodies", is that what you thought, is this what you're saying to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I cannot tell you what I thought at that stage.  As I said in court, I should have provided for the fact that this could have happened.   I did provide that this could happen, I foresaw that, and that the general wanted bodies and that people might be shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I do not expect of you to make your own inferences, or inferences as far as the jury is concerned, I want to know what you subjectively thought, and again I'm asking you, when you left there as part of this group, when you left the roadhouse, did you believe that when you got home tonight, there would have been people killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> So you agree with Mr Van der Schyff as far as that's concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If I understand you correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> You didn't see it as a definite instruction, you are going from here in order to kill people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, not to go and kill people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Do you have any proof or any reason to believe, according to your own knowledge, not from what you heard or with regards to the credibility to Kloppers, but subjectively, did you carry any knowledge that such an instruction would have been given by Oelofse, except for the words of Kloppers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> You said that you saw Oelofse at the Voortrekker Monument?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Did you ever see him pertinently that he was there holding discussions or giving instructions to Kloppers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> There was a camp fire at the Voortrekker Monument, the guys with the ranks were standing around this fire, together with Oelofse, and they were very friendly... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> And I'm asking you, did you see, or did you hear, that, if any specific instructions were given from Oelofse to Kloppers or Martin or anybody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Not at the monument, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Let's get to the last two facets according to which you testified.   You said that while you were in detention, there was a group discussion and then Oelofse told you that you ought to receive medals, and you said at a later stage in your evidence that he also said that it was the correct thing to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Let's accept for the moment, and I'll return to this, let's accept for the moment that this is exactly what Oelofse said, we accept he said this, now I would like to know from you, you must watch the news or you read the paper or whatever, we all know, it's quite actual news, especially in the Cape, there's an organisation which wants to fight against drugs and gangs, PAGAD, we all know that.   Now when I watch news in the evening, and I have young children, and I do not want them to use drugs, then I probably in sentiment agree with what PAGAD does.   Do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But does that mean that because I have the same sentiment, that I would do it myself, or that I would give them the instruction to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Now again I'm telling you, I put it to you, even if Oelofse said this, which I deny he said, but even if he had said that, I am telling you that he did not give the instruction that there should be such behaviour, and as far as you believed there was such an instruction, you only got that instruction from Kloppers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I received my instruction from Kloppers, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DREYER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BRINK</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I just also want to talk with regard to the rank structures and the execution of instructions.   You said that you did not expect that there would be bodies, but in the court they told you that you should have foreseen the possibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you did not expect it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you went to work, you expected that it's an operation in para-military fashion, but you testify that you stopped to chase black people and that some of your colleagues got behind the car and drove away with your vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct, they started driving away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How does that rhyme with, "Tonight, we have to work, tonight the revolution starts"?   You are saying that, in other evidence was that Mr Kloppers reprimanded you, or addressed you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct.   He said I must only follow instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But I want to connect this with regards to your expectations, did you think you were really going to work, or would you think it's a game?   I mean you jump out the car and chase somebody and other people drive away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, it wasn't a game.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So why did they drive away from you, have you ever asked them why they drove away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Ja, I went back to the vehicle and they asked me, "What did you shoot?", and I said I shot a black person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That was because I didn't have a rank and I didn't want to be reprimanded.   There was an assistant Commandant in the car, there were two "veldkornets" in the car, I was a bit scared to create conflict with them, I didn't know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Didn't you ask them, "Why do you drive away without my permission?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I did.   They only laughed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you think they were making a joke with you, when they were driving away from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I don't know, I cannot say what exactly they were thinking or what this person was thinking when he wanted to drive my car, it just happened like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you didn't think that this is quite serious, people are called up to go and work, the revolution starts tonight, you're already someone who's only been a member for a bit more than a week and it's such an important task, you jump out, you chase a black person, and the other people, who have the same important instructions, they drive away with your car and you didn't ask any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, I didn't ask them why they drove away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Have you asked them since then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, afterwards I did, but at that stage I did not ask them anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What did they tell you when you asked them afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That was when we were in jail already, and they said if I did not come, they would have left me there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> In which jail are you being held at the moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Diepkloof Maximum.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And how long have you been there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I've been transferred from Leeukop to Diepkloof in February this year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> February this year.   And your other co-applicants, in which jail are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Van der Schyff is also in Diepkloof, the rest of the people is in Leeukop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And after you were sentenced, after your criminal trial, were you in Leeukop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, they sent us to Diepkloof for a few months, and after that, we went to Pretoria Maximum, on death penalty, on death row, and after the death penalty was demolished, we were transferred back to Diepkloof, back to Pretoria Maximum again, and for the - from February last year to February this year, I was held in Leeukop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And at all times you've all been together as applicants, I mean you've been in the same prison with the other applicants?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> What I want to find out is, have you always been transferred together... (intervention).</p>

<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, February, I was transferred all by myself to Diepkloof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> So at the time that you made the application, you were all together in the same prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, we were in Leeukop the last application, that's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Okay, thanks very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR KNOETZE:</span> Mr Chairman, may I just, in view of the last question and the last answer?   Mr Visser, when you've just answered that when you submitted these applications you were all together, are you</p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a>meaning all the applicants except my two clients?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Mr Kloppers was not there either, he was in the hospital at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I think so, but the majority of us were together, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> So Mr Van der Schyff was not there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, he wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To a question put by Mr Dreyer, you said the purpose of, or perhaps just to make sure that that is in fact your evidence, I shouldn't tell you what you said, you haven't forgotten what you said a few minutes ago, but I want it to come from you, what was the purpose of the roadblock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> According to me, it was the start of the revolution, to see if we can get firearms and... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To kill people?   To kill people at the roadblock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, it's not what I'm asking.   I'm talking about the purpose of the roadblock.   You said it was to look for arms... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> For arms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you said to kill people.   Now I want to know from you whether you are now saying that the purpose of the roadblock was to look for arms and to kill people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, the people were killed.   To look for firearms... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can answer in Afrikaans, by the way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Okay, dankie.   The roadblock that we held was, well why did we search the vehicles, that is how I saw it from the position where I was, the vehicles were searched, they looked for weapons or firearms, and that was definitely the case, that was the purpose of the roadblock.   The people were questioned and people were killed at the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But let me put my question again this way, I put it...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a>TAPE TURNED OVER - WORDS LOST</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm trying to tell you from a political viewpoint.   At that stage I was politically involved and so forth.   What happened there was politically justified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, that's how you see it.   You see, at some point Mr Knoetze put it to you, and something you agreed with, he put it to you that, just like his client, just as in the case of his client, Mr Van der Schyff, the purpose of going there was not to go and kill, and you said yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I didn't receive an order, an instruction, to kill on the scene.   I was on my way back to my car when the shooting took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So when you... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I got... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...when you, Mr Visser, when you went to go and put up the roadblock, you did not expect that people were going to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, but I foreseen the fact that people can be killed in a process like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.   Mr Prinsloo?</p>

(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That people will die.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a>just after "ons het" must be put in "Deon Martin's house".

<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Diedericks, you joined the AWB in the middle of '93?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why did you join this movement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I joined because I believed in the ideology and that they wanted a homeland for the "boerevolk", like what the blacks had at that stage, and that they were able to realise that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you believe that, by means of the AWB, you would be able to resist it?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you attend any meetings of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, I did attend a few.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Diedericks, I would like to refer you to, or take you back to the 12th of December of 1993.   On the 12th December, or on that night, you were called up to go to Uncle Harry's road cafe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Who called you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Deon Martin's wife phoned me, and because I was alone, I drove to Deon's house, where she would look at the children, or look after the children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you left your children there are Deon Martin's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then you went to the road cafe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That's correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At the roadhouse, we already heard the evidence that you were brought together and you were addressed by Commandant Kloppers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That is correct.   Me and Commandant Martins got there, there were already a few others.   We stood around and waited, then Commandant Kloppers arrived.   He brought us to attention.   We saluted him, then Commandant  Kloppers said he just came back from an order group which he had on the smallholding of General Japie Oelofse, and that General Japie Oelofse gave the instruction that the revolution will begin tonight, "It is war now", he said and the time for games is over and that there must be corpses, he wants to see corpses, and that is now General Oelofse, this is the real thing, it was very definite.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were you armed when you arrived there and stood there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, I did not have a weapon then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were weapons given to you or to anybody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, Commandant Kloppers said to me that I must come with him to his vehicle.   He opened the boot of the Escort and took out two shotgun pipes, it was behind the seat, he took that out, he gave one to Etienne Visser and the other one to me, after which he asked me do I know how to work it and I said, "No, I do not know, I've never shot with one before", then Mr Van der Schyff came to me and he said to me, "Give it to me, I will show you how to shoot kaffirs".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did Mr Kloppers call Mr Van der Schyff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> He said to him, "Come here", and that is when Mr Van der Schyff said to me, "You do not know how to work it, I will show you how to shoot kaffirs with it".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you then give the weapon to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> On the instruction of Commandant Kloppers who said, "Give that thing to Mr Van der Schyff", and I executed that order and gave the weapon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> From the roadhouse did you then go to Mr Badenhorst's house with the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And at Mr Badenhorst's house, what did you do there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Commandant Deon Martin gave me an instruction to change the number plates, because I was a mechanical officer.   I changed the number plates, in order for the numbers not to be distinguishable if we were followed by the traffic cops.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what registration numbers of what vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> It was a Mercedes and the Nissan Sentra.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And from there you went to Mr Visser's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At the house of Mr Visser, did you drink any strong alcohol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, I didn't, I don't know about the others, I don't drink.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And from Mr Visser's house, did you go to Mr Leon Martin's smallholding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That is correct, yes, from where I went into the house, I saw that everything was all right and when I came out, I was then there where it was explained about the roadblock.   During the time that we moved from Andre Visser's to Deon Martin's house, I drove with Deon and Kloppers, and in the vehicle nothing was said under no circumstances about what is going to happen or what must be done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was there any equipment given to anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, I was given a light, or a jacket.   Peter Matthew's was given the other jacket.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And the blue light?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> The blue light was put in the Sentra, where I got the instruction to, when we reached the roadblock, I must connect it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after you then left Deon Martin's small-holding, who did you go with then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I drove with Kloppers and Martins and the other were in the Mercedes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you were not with the group where they mentioned the black people who were chased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> There were assaults along the road.   We drove and Phil Kloppers saw the Sentra had stopped.   He said to Deon to reverse to see what was going on, and then they sent me to go and call the guys, where I was part of the attack on the black people and where Mr Van der Schyff was also injured at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you yourself assault anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes I did.   I had a baton, and I attacked them with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You're talking about someone who was injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Mr Van der Schyff, I by mistake hit him on the ankle with the baton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after the incident, did you then leave there to the Radora Crossing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And at the Radora Crossing was there a roadblock as far as the evidence goes?   And what was your instruction there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I was given a torch and a baton, where I was told to pull off the cars, that if they show or flash their lights, that we must pull them off and that was the purpose, or my duty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why was the torch and baton given to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> The baton was given to me because I did not have a gun, and the torch was used to pull off the cars.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were vehicles pulled off the road at that roadblock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, as far as I can remember, four vehicles were pulled off, a Honda Ballade and a Cressida.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Let us go directly to the Honda Ballade and Cressida.   With this incident, what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> The vehicles approached us.   Deon and them flashed their lights and said, "These are the people, pull them off".   We waited.   The vehicles stopped and they came closer.   I pulled them off, where Commandant Phil Kloppers and Commandant Martin walked to the vehicles and asked the people to get out.   One of the persons did not want to react, whereas Commandant Kloppers took the baton from me and broke the windscreen on the side where the occupant then reacted and got out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The people that got out of this vehicle, or this specific vehicle, what did they have to do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> They were asked to - they were physically searched, not by myself, I cannot remember who did it.   I was told to search the inside of the car.   They had to sit next to the road on an embankment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And where were you positioned at that stage when the people went to go and sit on the embankment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> When the people went to go and sit on the embankment it was told to me, after the cars were searched, that I must go and stand directly opposite the road in the direction of Radora and look for vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> How far were you then from the scene where the people sat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Approximately 15 to 20 feet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you then focus your attention on coming vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At any stage did you receive the instruction at Radora to shoot at people or... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, not as far as I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Let me put it this way, you did not have a weapon so you had nothing to do with the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were shots fired at the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, what I saw what happened was that Andre Visser, or first Kallie Meiring walked past me to the Sentra, and then Andre Visser came towards me and just when he passed me, there was a group that formed.   They moved between and around the cars, and suddenly it was just one, or loud noise when the shots were fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after the shots were fired, did you remain at the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes I did, where Commandant Martin called me and he asked me for the torch.   I gave it to him and he gave me the instruction to go and help.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And the other people, did they leave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, they did.   Some of the people jumped into the Sentra and they drove off, whereas Commandant Kloppers shouted at them, "We will meet you at the town hall".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you see that anyone cut someone's ear off at the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after the shells were picked up at the scene, what happened then, except for picking up the shells?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> The vehicles were set alight, and afterwards Commandant Martin got into the vehicle, where we then left and I asked them to drop me off at Commandant Martin's house, because my children were there and I were worried about them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were you part of the setting alight of the vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you at any stage saw an ear in the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> If I remember correctly, the ear was mentioned.    A plastic bag was shown, I could not say if it was an ear inside or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then, were you then dropped off at Deon Martin's smallholding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, and that's where I left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were you at the Voortrekker Monument?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> On the 6th of January, were you arrested with the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Since you were arrested, were you with the others in detention, the other applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, we were separate, according to section 29, where in two days I was in Soweto, the rest of the time I was in hospital, and when I got out of hospital, I went to Diepkloof, and that was almost three weeks later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> While you were in detention, were you injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, I was attacked by the - assaulted by the police, after which I landed in the hospital two days after the arrest.   I was not charged with the others, I was only seven days later charged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Because of the injuries you sustained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, and while I was, and because I was in hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why were you assaulted by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1545"><a name="pos1545"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> They said that, I do not know if I can use the words, they said that I was stubborn and I did not want to talk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At what stage were you detained with the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> While we were waiting for the court case, I was there then separated from them for a week or two for operations on my shoulder, and after the court case, I was then completely separated from them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you were not in the Johannesburg Prison when the leader, Mr Terreblanche, came to visit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I was there, yes, at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Diedericks, did you act upon your own, or did you act individually that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, I acted as a soldier, I saw myself as a soldier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> A soldier of whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I was an officer in the AWB movement and I followed orders from my direct head or Chief Commander Kloppers, which was our area commander.   I did it for God, my "volk" and "vaderland".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At that stage, General Oelofse was your district commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Commandant Kloppers was basically the section commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were you promoted while you were detained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, that is correct, I was promoted from "veldkornet" to a full commandant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And when you submitted the application, were you then in prison?   You were not with the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, I wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRINSLOO</p>
<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS VAN DER WALT</p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR KNOETZE:</span> Mr Diedericks, firstly can I refer you to page 12 from the bundle of applications, and it's that of Kloppers, the one I already referred to this morning, I want to read to you paragraph 17</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a>"I arrived at the roadhouse at nine o'clock and Deon Martin brought them into attention.   I told them that the waiting is over and that the revolution would start that specific day and all over the country.   I also conveyed to them the instruction of General Oelofse.   They were told that General Oelofse wanted to see bodies, and I also handed out the two pipe shotguns to Visser and Martin van der Schyff.   I also told them we'd set up a roadblock where people will be questioned and that we should confiscate weapons and ammunition."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a>You would agree with me that if you look at this section of his affidavit or his application, that he did not give a weapon to you initially?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, I agree, it's not written there, but on his instruction the weapon was given to Martin van der Schyff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Yes, this new turn in events also came about after I put it this morning on behalf of my client that the two pipe shotguns were actually not given to Van der Schyff and Visser at the roadhouse, but to Van der Schyff and yourself.    So necessarily you must also be closer to the truth, but you still have not actually spoken the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Every person can say what he wants, I know what the truth is.   Your client will speak the truth he wants, but I know what I am saying, I cannot speak for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> What is strange for me and the committee is that the truth, according to what Klopper made an oath to in his application, and all the applicants made an oath to this extent, I'm not going to repeat this, they all swore that the truth is that the two pipes were given to Visser and Van der Schyff, and now suddenly the truth has changed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I know what happened there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With all respect, does Knoetze put it that Visser never had a weapon at the roadblock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1572"><a name="pos1572"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is not what I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1573"><a name="pos1573"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With respect, Mr Chairman, at some stage the weapon must have landed in the possession of Visser, and Mr Knoetze's not putting that to anyone, because he says Van der Schyff had the weapon and not Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1574"><a name="pos1574"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Mr Chairman, my learned friend missed something earlier today.    I put it on behalf of my client and I will repeat it now, that at the roadhouse the weapon was given to Van der Schyff and the other weapon was given to you, and later, at the smallholding, your weapon, your pipe was given to Etienne Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1575"><a name="pos1575"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I have stated, and I repeat it, I think that statement is incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1576"><a name="pos1576"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> You see, just to confirm this point, in his evidence in this case, in other words a long time after his application and if he then made a mistake he could have corrected the mistake here when Kloppers testified here, and I read it on page 249</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1577"><a name="pos1577"></a>"I asked who had weapons and it was said three of them did not have weapons, Martin and Van der Schyff, Etienne Visser.   I gave two pipe shotguns to them."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a>I put it to you again that your evidence, the same as Kloppers' and Etienne's, was amended because of the fact that my applicant amended his, because he's no longer your friend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I do not have contact with them, so what they say, they say, and what I say, I say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> But you see at least your evidence is closer to the truth in the sense that you got it initially?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1582"><a name="pos1582"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> But I put it to you that you kept this weapon until you got to the smallholding, and only there was your weapon given to Etienne Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, I'm still saying that statement is false.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And also, as you've heard, my client denied that he said, "Give me the weapon, I'll show you how to shoot kaffirs", he says he never said it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That's what he says.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And also he'll deny, which is also known to you, the fact that the revolution starts tonight, the hard options and the general wants to see bodies, and that they want to make a target out of the ANC/SACP alliance, he'd say that those things were not said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Again I put it to you, sir, he could have heard what he heard and he can say what he wants to say, what I heard, I said, and he's going to say what he heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KNOETZE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR DREYER:</span> Mr Diedericks, at the end of your evidence you said that what you did, you did for God, "volk" and "vaderland", is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's not what he said, Chairperson, that will be misleading if he said he did it on behalf of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Mr Chairman, I was only of opinion to ask a question on that particular portion, but if my learned friend want me to repeat that second part, I've got no problem with that, but my question does not pertain to that.  Maybe you should just allow me to ask my question and then, if need be, he can object.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1595"><a name="pos1595"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> As the Court pleases, Mr Chairman.   At the end of your evidence, you said you did it for God, "volk" and "vaderland" and also to support the ideology of the AWB in which you believed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1596"><a name="pos1596"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> And I'm saying this to you, as I also said it to the other applicants, I have no reason to believe or to say that you did not believe in it, but the question I want to ask you is, if you look at the phrasing of God, "volk" and "vaderland", then it would seem to me that the conviction  you had with regards to the undesirability of communism was not only because of your political conviction but also because of your religious conviction, if you say you did it for God, "volk" and "vaderland", is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Let me put it this way, do you know what God, "volk" and "vaderland" stands for?   If you do something, you do it with God's assistance, and you do it for your country and in order to obtain a country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I accept that.   All I'm asking you is, and the question is this, if you do not agree with me, then you can disagree with me, I'm only asking you, did you only see communism as a threat for your political convictions, or did you also see communism as a threat to your religious conviction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I saw it as a threat to everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But that's the statement I make, and then we agree.   Let's continue.   I want to know in the evidence of Mr Badenhorst it became apparent that what had happened before this meeting at the roadhouse there was a party where a whole group of people were together.   Were you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> When you completed this application form for amnesty, which is here in front of the committee today, surely you must have realised the serious implications it's going to have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1605"><a name="pos1605"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> At an earlier time I also put it to Kloppers that when you were involved in the criminal procedures, you ran the potential risk to be found guilty and be convicted, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1606"><a name="pos1606"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> So then it was important to you to put the case in a specific light, as good as you could?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But now that phase is completed, you were found guilty and you received a specific punishment for that, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1610"><a name="pos1610"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1611"><a name="pos1611"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Would you say that it's more important to you now or less important to tell the committee the whole truth so that once again you have a chance here to, despite the fact that you were already convicted, that you might receive amnesty and walk out of here as a free man, would you say it's more or less important?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> It's not important for myself, but it's important for my other colleagues to be a free person as I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Now what I'd like to know then is, it was important for you at the stage when you made this application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1614"><a name="pos1614"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That is true, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Now if this is such an important issue, can you think of any reason why this morning and up until now, with regards to each of these applicants, they deemed it necessary to amend the version, to add things to that and to bring about the change to the extent of when an instruction was received, can you think of a reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1616"><a name="pos1616"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1617"><a name="pos1617"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Because, you see, what is strange to me is that you come and testify today that you went with Kloppers to the vehicle and two pipe shotguns were taken out of the vehicle, is that correct?   Then you told the committee that you were asked, "How does this thing work?", and you said, "No, I don't know how it works", is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1619"><a name="pos1619"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Is the only time that you've seen these pipe shotguns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Did you ever see a pipe shotgun before that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1622"><a name="pos1622"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1623"><a name="pos1623"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Did you know how it was made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1624"><a name="pos1624"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1625"><a name="pos1625"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> You do not know how it works?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1626"><a name="pos1626"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1627"><a name="pos1627"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But sir, how can you, together with all the other applicants verbatim, in each of these applications, say in specific paragraphs, even though the number differs, but it appears on all the applications, that those two pipe shotguns were gotten from Japie Oelofse, how can you say that at an amnesty application if you do not know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1628"><a name="pos1628"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> There was a lot of talk about pipe shotguns, I never physically saw one before, but there was also talk about the fabrication of these things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1629"><a name="pos1629"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Sir, I put it to you that you're evading my question.   It's a really simple question, if you do not understand it, please tell me, and then I'll repeat it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1630"><a name="pos1630"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I'm answering your question, I did not know what they looked like, I did not know how they worked, but I heard that where they are produced or where they are fabricated.   I worked a lot on vehicles and that of Mr Oelofse, and I heard talk about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1631"><a name="pos1631"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> So everything you hear, is that necessarily the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1632"><a name="pos1632"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Let me put it this way... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1633"><a name="pos1633"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Sir, it's a simple question, is everything you hear the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1634"><a name="pos1634"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Would he be given a chance to answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1635"><a name="pos1635"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Not everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1636"><a name="pos1636"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Now sir, I'm asking you again, this is a very important issue, you are here to come and ask for amnesty, but in the course thereof you made certain allegations which incriminate other people and now I'm asking you once again, say you did not testify to this at all, the fact that you have said that these two pipe shotguns came from Oelofse and, against the background that at the criminal procedures it was testified that it came from Nick Fourie, now you come, you and other applicants, and you include a statement and you say that these two pipe shotguns come from Japie Oelofse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1637"><a name="pos1637"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> If you were with Japie Oelofse in that prison and he told you what to say in criminal procedures, you would have done it as well, because you were under instruction.   That's what happened to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1638"><a name="pos1638"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> As far as I understand your cross-questioning, you, I ask the questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1639"><a name="pos1639"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, I put it to you, we were with him in prison, he told us, "Say this in the criminal procedures", we must protect him, he's the general, he has to be outside, not on the inside, and that's exactly what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1640"><a name="pos1640"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But I do not understand what you are saying to me, when were these criminal procedures and when were you in prison, and why is it the first time I heard about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1641"><a name="pos1641"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Japie was with us when we waited for the trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1642"><a name="pos1642"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> You're the first applicant who came and said that Japie told you what to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1643"><a name="pos1643"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1644"><a name="pos1644"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I will retract that statement, Mr Chairman.   If you say that, let's get the chronological order correct here, when did Japie Oelofse told you what you should say during the trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1645"><a name="pos1645"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> While we were waiting for the trial to start.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1646"><a name="pos1646"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Now why would he tell you on one side, now let's make this fair towards you, because otherwise maybe it's said that I'm not making a correct statement towards you, I do not want to mislead you, are you telling me that Japie Oelofse told you what to say during the criminal procedures which was not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1647"><a name="pos1647"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You know, he'll sit here the whole afternoon telling us what that person said.   You've got to be specific... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1648"><a name="pos1648"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I take note, Mr Chairman, I will rephrase it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1649"><a name="pos1649"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...because that question knows of no limits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1650"><a name="pos1650"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I take note, Mr Chairman, I'll limit that.   Let's put it - and this question was also asked to the other applicants, specifically to Kloppers, because Kloppers gave the same reasoning, he said that he tried to protect Oelofse, and it was pointed out to him that in his evidence during the criminal procedures, in any ways he involved Oelofse and other people, so if Oelofse told you to go and say certain things in order to protect him, then it would seem that it did not happen, because eventually he was incriminated during the proceedings, and I do not understand what you are saying to me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1651"><a name="pos1651"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Our case was separate from theirs, I did not give evidence, so I could not incriminate him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1652"><a name="pos1652"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I accept that, let's return to what I've said, you said you heard specific things, all that I'd like to know is, the day when you were at the roadhouse, at the road cafe, before you reached the roadblock and the two shotguns were shown to you and you said you do not know how to work it, in that evening did you know, with your own knowledge, that those guns come from Japie Oelofse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1653"><a name="pos1653"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, it was, someone said that it comes from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1654"><a name="pos1654"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But it does not say that in your statement or application.   Let me ask you another question, you gave evidence, and you heard about the ear, or you saw that there was an ear that was cut off, what do you know about the ear, what do you know about the discussion concerning the ear?   Were you not present when it was said that the ear will be given to Oelofse the next day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1655"><a name="pos1655"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I believe that if you were in my position, after what happened, you will also not hear every single thing that happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1656"><a name="pos1656"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I accept that you cannot remember it, and I understand it and I realise it was a traumatic experience, all that I'd like to know is, when the ear, or the topic around the ear came up in the car, and it was held in a plastic bag, what was said there then that you can remember concerning the ear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1657"><a name="pos1657"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1658"><a name="pos1658"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> You do not know who cut the ear off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1659"><a name="pos1659"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I heard at one stage it was Deon Martins.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1660"><a name="pos1660"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> You heard it, you do not know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1661"><a name="pos1661"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1662"><a name="pos1662"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> And when it was done and you heard about it, did you not know why it was done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1663"><a name="pos1663"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That's correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1664"><a name="pos1664"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Let me come back to my original question that I asked to all the other applicants under evidence they gave, you reacted on a command which you believed came from the general's staff, and that was conveyed to you by Kloppers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1665"><a name="pos1665"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, I believed that that was an instruction that come from the generals in staff via Commandant Kloppers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1666"><a name="pos1666"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> And you believed, as a supporter of the AWB, and in the rank order of the organisation, and it was within your conviction, that you will execute that order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1667"><a name="pos1667"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1668"><a name="pos1668"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> But now that if it seems that there was no such an order, what then?   In other words, if there were no other order higher up in the ranks, what now, what then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1669"><a name="pos1669"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Then Commandant Kloppers will have to answer that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1670"><a name="pos1670"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Well we have dealt with that.   Let me ask you questions about the festivities around the Voortrekker Monument.   Were you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1671"><a name="pos1671"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1672"><a name="pos1672"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Were you in the area or where you lived, although you did not attend the proceedings... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1673"><a name="pos1673"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1674"><a name="pos1674"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> ...did you also in that evening understood that tonight, the 12th or 13th of December, that evening or morning, the revolution will start, did you understand it that way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1675"><a name="pos1675"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1676"><a name="pos1676"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> You go out with this group, there's a specific incident, did you think that it was an isolated incident, or did you think that this is part of a full-scale, country-wide, revolution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1677"><a name="pos1677"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I thought that it was a full-scale revolution.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1678"><a name="pos1678"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> When you, it was the 16th or the 20th of December, realised, I'm not talking about explosions, I'm talking about the evening when this incident occurred, when a week later you realised that that evening there was seemingly only this one incident, as far as I understand this is what happened, did you not start to doubt how it is possible that this is the only incident that occurred on a national level, didn't it bother you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1679"><a name="pos1679"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes it did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1680"><a name="pos1680"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Now sir, in your own words you said it did, may I ask you why did it bother you?   Didn't you start to doubt if there was such an order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1681"><a name="pos1681"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, for us it was, or we were told afterwards the people did not work and that was that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1682"><a name="pos1682"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Okay, let us get to that statement, because that was mentioned earlier on. Evidence was given that Eugene Terreblanche at one stage in a visit said to you while you were detained that if everybody did what was expected of them that evening, the revolution would have succeeded, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1683"><a name="pos1683"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1684"><a name="pos1684"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Now I'd like to ask you, at one stage amounts or numbers were mentioned of how many then commando members, or active members, there were in the AWB at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1685"><a name="pos1685"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I had no input in the logistics, I cannot remember the amounts, but I know there were a lot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1686"><a name="pos1686"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I think Mr Kloppers gave evidence regarding this   Now I come back to my question, did you believe that the AWB, as an organisation, existed countrywide?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1687"><a name="pos1687"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> In certain areas it was stronger, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1688"><a name="pos1688"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I come back again to my question, did it truly not bother you that you were the only person, or only group of nine people out of the total number of AWB members, who were obedient to the top structure of the AWB in that "today the revolution starts", didn't it bother you, how is it possible within a rank order in an organisation like the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1689"><a name="pos1689"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> You've asked that question and I said yes, it did bother me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1690"><a name="pos1690"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> You thus say that notwithstanding that you did not doubt that in the higher ranks such an order existed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1691"><a name="pos1691"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I received my instructions from Commandant Kloppers and where he got his instructions, he will have to say, I'm not going to say what he - I have to report back to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1692"><a name="pos1692"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Well that brings me to the conclusion, I say again to you I have got no knowledge where I can say, you allege it, and I do take note of it, you say that you received your orders from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1693"><a name="pos1693"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1694"><a name="pos1694"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I cannot take responsibility for that, but you said you did not acted regarding those instructions, I'm just asking you, sir, when, after this incident, you saw that nothing else happened out of the total structure of the AWB, you certainly did not believe that the rest of the AWB members, the military members, ignored all other instructions and did not continue, it could not have happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1695"><a name="pos1695"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I don't know what the question is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1696"><a name="pos1696"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> I'll ask again, are you saying that after this incident you believed that, although there was a military order or command from the top structure, that all other area commanders and the people who were a rank below them, ignored this command or order and did not execute it, when it was decided by the top structure that "tonight, the 12th, revolution starts"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1697"><a name="pos1697"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I believed, or I wondered why the others did not execute the order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1698"><a name="pos1698"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Now I'll put it to you, sir, the reason for this is, it's very obvious, it's simple, there was no order from a rank above the rank of your commander, Mr Klopper, he may have conveyed it to you, but I put it to you there was no such an order and that is why, in other areas, nothing happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1699"><a name="pos1699"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you want to comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1700"><a name="pos1700"></a>TAPE TURNED OVER - WORDS LOST</p>
<p class="line" id="line1701"><a name="pos1701"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DREYER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1702"><a name="pos1702"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BRINK:</span> When you were at the roadblock and these two cars were stopped and the occupants were taken out, did you hear any of your colleagues asking questions of the occupants, or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1703"><a name="pos1703"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, I was too far away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1704"><a name="pos1704"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Praat in Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1705"><a name="pos1705"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, I was too far away, I could not hear anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1706"><a name="pos1706"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Goed, dankie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1707"><a name="pos1707"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BRINK</p>
<p class="line" id="line1708"><a name="pos1708"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The last question that the chairperson asked you if you had any comment, you said no, it was Mr Dreyer's opinion.   He said are you worried about that, that only your unit acted on that evening.   Mr Dreyer tried to present you with an answer in his opinion and the reason was that there was no such order.   Have you got any other possibility or any other explanation why that happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1709"><a name="pos1709"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, Mr Chairperson, I believe everyone tries to find a reason why it did not happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1710"><a name="pos1710"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So at this stage you've got no reason.   Is the reason that Mr Dreyer put to you, is that a possibility in your eyes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1711"><a name="pos1711"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1712"><a name="pos1712"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you still think that there was, there still was such an order and the others just did not execute it?  Are you honest if you say that, or do you say that or any other reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1713"><a name="pos1713"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, I'm honest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1714"><a name="pos1714"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You still believe that there was such a national order and everybody ignored it except Chief Commander Kloppers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1715"><a name="pos1715"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I do not believe everyone ignored it, because there were certain explosions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1716"><a name="pos1716"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, I'm talking about that specific night.   I'm not trying to confuse you, I just want to know if you honestly believe that, for some reason nobody else did it, but the order was there, that it did exist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1717"><a name="pos1717"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> My impression of the revolution was that it begins in small groups and only certain selected groups begins with instigating chaos and revolt, and certain groups takes over in this chaos situation to take it further.  It's like a small group that started, there must be a beginning point, and I believed that we were that group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1718"><a name="pos1718"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So it would not have bothered you if no-one else did it, because your group was that evening the starting point?   Why did it bother you then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1719"><a name="pos1719"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Because it was only one small starting group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1720"><a name="pos1720"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You expected there to be more other small groups?  I would just like to ask you another thing, in cross-examination you said that General Oelofse said to you what you must do in the criminal procedures and what evidence you must give, he's an officer, you are on his instruction and you executed it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1721"><a name="pos1721"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1722"><a name="pos1722"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I'm paraphrasing you, it was not your words, but that is how I understood you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1723"><a name="pos1723"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Certain things were asked or told to us not to say during the proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1724"><a name="pos1724"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And because he was an officer, you listened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1725"><a name="pos1725"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1726"><a name="pos1726"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And if Chief Commandant Kloppers would have directed the same request, would you have handled it in the same way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1727"><a name="pos1727"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1728"><a name="pos1728"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If he requested you to do this regarding the amnesty application, would you have done it in the same way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1729"><a name="pos1729"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, as a soldier and he gave me the order, and if I still was, or if I was a soldier under his command, I would have done it, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1730"><a name="pos1730"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Since when have you not... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1731"><a name="pos1731"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I haven't been a soldier under him since 1995.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1732"><a name="pos1732"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you at any stage part of any planning when they talked about what we would say at certain stages, were you part of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1733"><a name="pos1733"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1734"><a name="pos1734"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And then at any stage, or at no stage, did you correspond or discuss with the others what you would say in your amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1735"><a name="pos1735"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, I was separated from them from the beginning of my (indistinct), or charge, I was alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1736"><a name="pos1736"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who submitted your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1737"><a name="pos1737"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> In consultation with my lawyers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1738"><a name="pos1738"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did they also act on behalf of the others during that period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1739"><a name="pos1739"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I do not know on behalf of whom they acted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1740"><a name="pos1740"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1741"><a name="pos1741"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Sir, this incident when you were on your way to the roadblock when these black people were chased and you also took part in it, my impression, after the evidence of Mr Visser, that this was a bit of fun, or... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1742"><a name="pos1742"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That is correct, that is how it appeared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1743"><a name="pos1743"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Don't you find it strange that while you're on the way to such a serious operation, that you'd stop along the way and have some fun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1744"><a name="pos1744"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> That is Commandant Kloppers and Martins was very angry and sent me to go and fetch these people and tell them to stop it and come along, there's no time for such things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1745"><a name="pos1745"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Can you give any reason why the people was in a mood to have fun, because it bothers me, I do not understand it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1746"><a name="pos1746"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, I cannot say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1747"><a name="pos1747"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Is it not possible that the alcohol consumption played a role, that maybe earlier in the day they drank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1748"><a name="pos1748"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I won't be able to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1749"><a name="pos1749"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Do you know people, or do you know when someone is under the influence of alcohol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1750"><a name="pos1750"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Definitely, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1751"><a name="pos1751"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Would you say that they were under the influence of alcohol, because you went to go and talk to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1752"><a name="pos1752"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I knew some of them and they were definitely not under the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1753"><a name="pos1753"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1754"><a name="pos1754"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Chairperson, may I just ask a follow-up question, maybe Mr Prinsloo must help me if I'm wrong, but I thought I heard you say that when you got out, you also assaulted the black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1755"><a name="pos1755"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1756"><a name="pos1756"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You are sent to go and stop them and go and fetch them, but you also take part in the assault, did I hear you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1757"><a name="pos1757"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, the black person, while they hit him, he swore at us, and that is when that I would also hit him, because I don't like when people swear at me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1758"><a name="pos1758"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So your instruction from Kloppers to go and get the others, get away from the assault and you also took part then in the assault, is that what you're saying to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1759"><a name="pos1759"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> Yes, I did not follow his instructions to a certain extent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1760"><a name="pos1760"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you injure or beat Van der Schyff with the baton?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1761"><a name="pos1761"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> I wanted to, also to hit, but because I, or by mistake, I wanted to hit the person that was being assaulted and then by mistake I hit Van der Schyff, he was busy to struggle with the person on the ground and then I hit him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1762"><a name="pos1762"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was not because you were under the influence of liquor and you could not distinguish the wood for the tree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1763"><a name="pos1763"></a><span class="speaker">MR DIEDERICKS:</span> No, that was not the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1764"><a name="pos1764"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Mr Chairman, may I just ask a question in connection with the fact that he was ignoring a specific order, if I</p>
<p class="line" id="line1765"><a name="pos1765"></a>may, in respect of the question put by the committee (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1766"><a name="pos1766"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well he disobeyed Kloppers' order, not Oelofse's order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1767"><a name="pos1767"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Yes, that is so, Mr Chairman... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1768"><a name="pos1768"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A specific order to go and remove these people from the assault.   It has nothing to do with Oelofse's original order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1769"><a name="pos1769"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> Yes, that is so, but I just wanted to try and get some relation between a minor order and obviously a very major order of starting a revolution, but if the Court feels that it's unnecessary, I won't press it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1770"><a name="pos1770"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think - I think it's too tenuous, I don't think we should allow you to ask questions on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1771"><a name="pos1771"></a><span class="speaker">MR DREYER:</span> As you please, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1772"><a name="pos1772"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR PRINSLOO</p>

<p class="line" id="line1780"><a name="pos1780"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> To request the committee to amend your written application in this fashion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1781"><a name="pos1781"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1785"><a name="pos1785"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I had a brother and a sister, a mother and a father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1786"><a name="pos1786"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> What occupation was your father?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1787"><a name="pos1787"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> He was a plumber.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1788"><a name="pos1788"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And what was his political views?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1789"><a name="pos1789"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Nothing, none.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1790"><a name="pos1790"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And your mother's political views?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1791"><a name="pos1791"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> None.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1792"><a name="pos1792"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And where did you go to primary school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1793"><a name="pos1793"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> In Randfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1794"><a name="pos1794"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And your secondary education</p>
<p class="line" id="line1795"><a name="pos1795"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Randfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1796"><a name="pos1796"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And the white community, what kind of people did they consist of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1797"><a name="pos1797"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> It was a very conservative community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1798"><a name="pos1798"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And what were that community's political views, mainly, the people you had contact with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1799"><a name="pos1799"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Their view was negative towards the blacks, let's say they didn't accept them at all, specifically the ANC/SACP alliance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1800"><a name="pos1800"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Were you already aware of the security situation within the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1801"><a name="pos1801"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1802"><a name="pos1802"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And that there was a state of emergency?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1803"><a name="pos1803"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1804"><a name="pos1804"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And that had to do with the battle between the whites and the non-whites?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1805"><a name="pos1805"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1806"><a name="pos1806"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Did you do military service?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1807"><a name="pos1807"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1808"><a name="pos1808"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1809"><a name="pos1809"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> 1 South African Infantry Battalion in Bloemfontein and later I was transferred to 61 Battalion Group in South West Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1810"><a name="pos1810"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And what service did you complete there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1811"><a name="pos1811"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Border service.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1812"><a name="pos1812"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Was that service in the war against Swapo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1813"><a name="pos1813"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1814"><a name="pos1814"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And what was your personal opinion of the army's activities at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1815"><a name="pos1815"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> They played an important role for the country, for South Africa, in order to keep the enemy outside of the country and not allow the enemy to come into the country to commit acts of terror.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1816"><a name="pos1816"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Can you just speak a little bit slower, they're interpreting.   Did you agree with these views in this war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1817"><a name="pos1817"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Yes, I agreed with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1818"><a name="pos1818"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> After your military service, did you attend military camps?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1819"><a name="pos1819"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1820"><a name="pos1820"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And did you do it voluntarily, or was it difficult for you to join in those activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1821"><a name="pos1821"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> It was my duty to attend South African Defence Force camps.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1822"><a name="pos1822"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Is it also correct that you also were a police reservist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1823"><a name="pos1823"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1824"><a name="pos1824"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Could you just explain to them when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1825"><a name="pos1825"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Since 1985 up until 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1826"><a name="pos1826"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Does this mean that you did this while you were still a scholar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1827"><a name="pos1827"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1828"><a name="pos1828"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And did you receive any tertiary education?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1829"><a name="pos1829"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Yes, I worked at Transnet, I received training there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1830"><a name="pos1830"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And did you qualify there, did you graduate there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1831"><a name="pos1831"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Yes, I did graduate there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1832"><a name="pos1832"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Who did you work for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1833"><a name="pos1833"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Transnet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1834"><a name="pos1834"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> What was your political views with regards to the security situation in the early 90's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1835"><a name="pos1835"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I became more and more involved with the right politics, because I believed the right-wing people were the only people to stop the ANC/SACP alliance, which was to take place in the 1994 elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1836"><a name="pos1836"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Did you join any political parties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1837"><a name="pos1837"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1838"><a name="pos1838"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Who did you join?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1839"><a name="pos1839"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I joined the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1840"><a name="pos1840"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> How did it come about that you joined them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1841"><a name="pos1841"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I became interested in all their objectives and the ones they submitted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1842"><a name="pos1842"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Which of their policy principles attracted you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1843"><a name="pos1843"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> The fact that we could govern ourselves and also the piece of ground, your own country, a place where you can have your own schools, own education.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1844"><a name="pos1844"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And what was your view with regards to the policy principles of the ANC/SACP then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1845"><a name="pos1845"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Their principle was to take over the country within all their power, and as a member of the AWB it was unacceptable to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1846"><a name="pos1846"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And what was your view with regards to the policy of the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1847"><a name="pos1847"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> The PAC's policy was more or less the same and it was also unacceptable to me as a member of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1848"><a name="pos1848"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Which position did you have once you joined the AWB?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1850"><a name="pos1850"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> How did it come about that you became an assistant area commandant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1851"><a name="pos1851"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Chief Commandant Klopper and Deon Martin graduated me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1852"><a name="pos1852"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Is this after you wrote an exam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1853"><a name="pos1853"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1854"><a name="pos1854"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And this examination, did you have to write it after you've had to study the book as it was submitted here, which is known as "Phase 1"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1855"><a name="pos1855"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1856"><a name="pos1856"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And did you also agree with the AWB's policy which is contained within that book?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1857"><a name="pos1857"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1858"><a name="pos1858"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Did you receive any training when you were a member of AWB?   What was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1859"><a name="pos1859"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> It was normal militarily uptraining,</p>
<p class="line" id="line1860"><a name="pos1860"></a>training as shooting, as well as marching,  etcetera.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1861"><a name="pos1861"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Did you do any service while you were a member of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1862"><a name="pos1862"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1863"><a name="pos1863"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> What was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1864"><a name="pos1864"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I was a driver of Mr Kloppers, as well as his bodyguard, and I also did security work for General Oelofse, as well as his wife, Stefanie Oelofse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1865"><a name="pos1865"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Did you partake in any demonstrations or marches of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1866"><a name="pos1866"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Yes, I partook in them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1867"><a name="pos1867"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> When?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1868"><a name="pos1868"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> In Vereeniging.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1869"><a name="pos1869"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And what did it entail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1870"><a name="pos1870"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> It was a march the AWB had, together with Inkatha, and I went there in order for guidance as well as for the protection of Oelofse and his wife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1871"><a name="pos1871"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> These things, did you do them while you were in the complete uniform of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1872"><a name="pos1872"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1873"><a name="pos1873"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Now, except for the other members of the AWB, of this group who was also aware of the fact that you were a member of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1874"><a name="pos1874"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> The whole Wesrand vicinity, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1875"><a name="pos1875"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> How can you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1876"><a name="pos1876"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I was a well-known person, not only in Randfontein, but on the whole Wesrand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1877"><a name="pos1877"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Can the committee make an inference then that you were proud of the fact that you were a member of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1878"><a name="pos1878"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Yes, I was very proud of the fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1879"><a name="pos1879"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Did you also attend some of their political meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1880"><a name="pos1880"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Yes, I did attend them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1881"><a name="pos1881"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Can you mention a few of those to the committee members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1882"><a name="pos1882"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> One in Johannesburg where the leader, Eugene Terreblanche, spoke to me personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1883"><a name="pos1883"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And these political meetings, what kind of uniform did you wear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1884"><a name="pos1884"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I did it in civvy clothes, as well as in AWB uniform.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1885"><a name="pos1885"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> So what did you want to achieve by being a member of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1886"><a name="pos1886"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> In order to obtain the so-called "volkstaat" and to make use of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1887"><a name="pos1887"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> How did it become that during the evening of 12th of March 1993, in uniform, sorry, not March, but December, sorry, Chairperson, December 1993, in your AWB uniform, how did you arrive at the roadhouse between quarter past seven... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1888"><a name="pos1888"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I found, I received a call from Deon Martin's wife, that's Louise Martins, and she told me that Chief Commandant Klopper gave an instruction that we were going to work that evening, and she also mentioned to me that it has to take place in complete AWB uniform.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1889"><a name="pos1889"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Maybe you must just speak a little bit slower.  Then you went to the roadhouse, that's a well-known fact, what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1890"><a name="pos1890"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> We waited there for Kloppers, as well as for Visser, and a little while later Visser arrived, and then Klopper arrived, and then Martin brought us all to attention.   He saluted Kloppers and then Kloppers said that that night we are going to work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1891"><a name="pos1891"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> What else was said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1892"><a name="pos1892"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> He asked who did not have weapons and three persons reacted and said, me myself, Gert Diedericks, as well as Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1893"><a name="pos1893"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Did he do something with regards to that situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1894"><a name="pos1894"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Yes, he gave two pipe shotguns to myself and to Mr Diedericks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1895"><a name="pos1895"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> You heard the accusations of what you then apparently had said with regards to the obtaining of the weapons and you said that you wanted it so you could show how you're going to shoot kaffirs that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1896"><a name="pos1896"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I heard the accusations, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1897"><a name="pos1897"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> What's your comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1898"><a name="pos1898"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's a blatant lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1899"><a name="pos1899"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> While we're at this point, eventually we know, the committee knows, that Diedericks did not have the weapon when this shooting took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1900"><a name="pos1900"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> No, he did not have a pipe shotgun when the shooting took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1901"><a name="pos1901"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> How did that come about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1902"><a name="pos1902"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> After the pipe shotgun was given to me and Diedericks at the roadside cafe, Kloppers said that we had to get into the vehicles and we must go to Badenhorst's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1903"><a name="pos1903"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> To make it short, the pipe shotgun, was it then taken at a later stage, taken from Diedericks and given to Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1904"><a name="pos1904"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1905"><a name="pos1905"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Where did this happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1906"><a name="pos1906"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> This happened at Deon Martin's smallholding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1907"><a name="pos1907"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> If we can just come back to the roadhouse, you heard what the other applicants said with regards to what Kloppers then would have said that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1908"><a name="pos1908"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I heard that, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1909"><a name="pos1909"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> What's your comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1910"><a name="pos1910"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> It was not the evening he said these things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1911"><a name="pos1911"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Did he say that the revolution would start that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1912"><a name="pos1912"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> No, under no circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1913"><a name="pos1913"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Did he say that Japie Oelofse wanted to see bodies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1914"><a name="pos1914"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Under no circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1915"><a name="pos1915"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Did he talk about the real McCoy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1916"><a name="pos1916"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> No, he did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1917"><a name="pos1917"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Hard options?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1918"><a name="pos1918"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Under no circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1919"><a name="pos1919"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> So you left there, you left the roadhouse, and where did you go then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1920"><a name="pos1920"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I got into the car of Andre Visser, into his Sentra, and I went to Jaco Badenhorst's parents' home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1921"><a name="pos1921"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1922"><a name="pos1922"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> When we got there, we only used two vehicles, the Mercedes Benz and the Sentra, and the registration numbers of both vehicles were changed by using masking tape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1923"><a name="pos1923"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And from there, where did you go when you left there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1924"><a name="pos1924"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> From Mr Badenhorst's house we went to Visser's flat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1925"><a name="pos1925"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> What happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1926"><a name="pos1926"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> When we got there, a bottle of whisky was produced.   It wasn't completely full, and it was already open.   Me personally did not drink any of the whisky, but there were some of the members who did drink the whisky.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1927"><a name="pos1927"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Okay.   And where did you go after you've left that flat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1928"><a name="pos1928"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> From there we went to Deon Martin's smallholding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1929"><a name="pos1929"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> What happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1930"><a name="pos1930"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> There Kloppers brought a bottle of brandy as well as two litres of Coke, the bottle of brandy was half full and he divided this between the two vehicles, discussions were also held, and we said that we'd set up a roadblock and the necessary equipment was handed over to us there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1931"><a name="pos1931"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Did you receive any of the equipment?   What did you receive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1932"><a name="pos1932"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I got the jacket, the shining jacket.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1933"><a name="pos1933"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> What happened when you left there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1934"><a name="pos1934"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> After we received everything, we left there.   We were a few metres away from Martin's smallholding when we saw two blacks walking in the road.  The Sentra stopped.   Some of the members, myself included, jumped out.   The blacks who walked there, we followed them and we assaulted them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1935"><a name="pos1935"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Maybe you must just quickly go back to the instruction that a roadblock should be held.   What was the purpose of the roadblock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1936"><a name="pos1936"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> The purpose was to look for illegitimate weapons and ammunition which was entering our towns and which was used to kill or harm old people and innocent people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1937"><a name="pos1937"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> After this assault on these black people, did you then go to the Radora Crossing where you would then have the roadblock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1938"><a name="pos1938"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1939"><a name="pos1939"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> What happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1940"><a name="pos1940"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> On our arrival there, Mr Meiring put us in specific positions, because he had the experience in order to have a roadblock.   Me myself, Matthew's and Diedericks was told to act as traffic officials.   Two other people, Visser, Etienne Visser and Mr Jaco Badenhorst, was told to stand behind the chevron board.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1941"><a name="pos1941"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Okay, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1942"><a name="pos1942"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> It was decided that the Sentra would be the emergency vehicle, with the blue light on top of it, and Kloppers and Martins would then drive in the Mercedes Benz towards Ventersdorp and as soon as they will flash their headlights to us, we'd know that this is the necessary target to pull off, and the target we would have had to pull off would only have black occupants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1943"><a name="pos1943"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And did you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1944"><a name="pos1944"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Yes, we pulled off vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1945"><a name="pos1945"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Before we get to the Honda and the Cressida, can you tell us about the other vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1946"><a name="pos1946"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> There were several vehicles pulled off.  At one stage a vehicle was pulled off with a black person in it, and this black person resisted us, because he didn't want us to search his vehicle, and Klopper hit the man on the head with a baton and I stood watching this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1947"><a name="pos1947"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Let's interrupt ourselves, in the criminal proceedings later you were found guilty of that assault as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1948"><a name="pos1948"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Yes, I was found guilty thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1949"><a name="pos1949"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> In the sense that you should have foreseen it and you were an accomplice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1950"><a name="pos1950"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1951"><a name="pos1951"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And you also ask for amnesty with regards to that assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1952"><a name="pos1952"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1953"><a name="pos1953"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Can you remember anything else with regards to the other vehicles before you pulled the Honda and the Sentra off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1954"><a name="pos1954"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> At a later stage there was another vehicle, it was a big pick-up, Ford pick-up truck.   The car wouldn't start and we were told to push the car so that it could start, and we did that, and the vehicle drove off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1955"><a name="pos1955"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> These vehicles, were they searched?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1956"><a name="pos1956"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> All the vehicles were searched, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1957"><a name="pos1957"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> With what purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1958"><a name="pos1958"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> The purpose was to try and find illegitimate weapons and ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1959"><a name="pos1959"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And can the committee make the reference that no such weapons were found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1960"><a name="pos1960"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> No weapons were found, illegal weapons, that is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1961"><a name="pos1961"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Evidence was given in front of the committee with regards to questions that was asked to the occupants of the vehicles.   What's your comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1962"><a name="pos1962"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> No questions were asked while the vehicles were searched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1963"><a name="pos1963"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> I refer you specifically to questions with regards to political affiliations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1964"><a name="pos1964"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Nothing, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1965"><a name="pos1965"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> So then the Honda and the Cressida came onto the scene, and the committee know that they were stopped, or they stopped first and they both arrived there simultaneously.   Would you please take it from there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1966"><a name="pos1966"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Once they were both at the roadblock, the vehicles approached us, the Ballade was in the front and behind it the Cressida.   The Honda was pulled off.   Inside the Honda there were three people, three men.   I walked towards the vehicle.   I commanded the driver to get out, and I told him to go and sit on the ground.   The two passengers who were with him also got out and they also sat down on the ground.   The vehicle was searched where the people sat themselves as well as the boot.   The people in the Toyota Cressida did not want to get out of the car under any circumstances and then Klopper walked closer on the driver's side, he shattered the windscreen with his baton and all the passengers in that car then got out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1967"><a name="pos1967"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Maybe, while we're there, maybe we must just stop.   Is it also so that you put together a sketch plan of the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1968"><a name="pos1968"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1969"><a name="pos1969"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Mr Chairman, may I beg leave to hand up copies of this to the committee, which I think may be of some assistance?   It would be EXHIBIT 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1970"><a name="pos1970"></a>SKETCH PLAN HANDED UP AS EXHIBIT 7</p>
<p class="line" id="line1971"><a name="pos1971"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Is it correct that you also submitted an explanation for this sketch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1972"><a name="pos1972"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1973"><a name="pos1973"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Mr Chairman, what I did with mine is to write in precisely what everything is, so that one doesn't have to refer back every time.   Let us begin with A, what is A?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1974"><a name="pos1974"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Point A is the so-called Radora Crossing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1975"><a name="pos1975"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And B?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1976"><a name="pos1976"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Point B is the Ventersdorp Road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1977"><a name="pos1977"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> In other words traffic that moves from left to right on that part that you've indicated there, will move towards Ventersdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1978"><a name="pos1978"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's right, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1979"><a name="pos1979"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And C is on the other side of the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1980"><a name="pos1980"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairperson, that's from Ventersdorp to Krugersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1981"><a name="pos1981"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't, I haven't really studied this, but I wonder, have you discussed this with the other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1982"><a name="pos1982"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1983"><a name="pos1983"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you discussed this sketch with Mr Prinsloo, Ms Van der Walt, Mr Dreyer, (Indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1984"><a name="pos1984"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> No, I have not, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1985"><a name="pos1985"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I sincerely hope that it's not going to cause so much dispute, because we don't contemplate being drawn to a point where we'll have to go for an inspection in loco as a result of some disputes arising from around this point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1986"><a name="pos1986"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Well so do I, Mr Chairman, but I don't foresee such disputes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1987"><a name="pos1987"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it possible to deal with other aspects of the matter for the time being, to leave this aside for a while?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1988"><a name="pos1988"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> It is possible, Mr Chairman, but I thought that it would make it clear to the committee where everything just took place, I thought it would be of some assistance, for instance to indicate this so-called line of people that were about to shoot and the line of people sitting as people about to be shot.   It's just helpful in my view, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1989"><a name="pos1989"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prinsloo... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1990"><a name="pos1990"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1991"><a name="pos1991"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is your attitude towards this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1992"><a name="pos1992"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, could I take instructions on this, we don't know, so... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1993"><a name="pos1993"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All right... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1994"><a name="pos1994"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> (Inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1995"><a name="pos1995"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I dread even looking into it, I won't like to do that.   Let's deal with other aspects of the matter if we can, and maybe tomorrow, by tomorrow Mr Prinsloo would have had a look at it, and then we can talk about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1996"><a name="pos1996"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> As you please, Mr Chairman.   Let us come back to this roadblock, what you've already said is that the Honda was searched, the people got out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1997"><a name="pos1997"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1998"><a name="pos1998"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> The Cressida was searched and the people got out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1999"><a name="pos1999"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2000"><a name="pos2000"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> After the side windscreen was shattered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2001"><a name="pos2001"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2002"><a name="pos2002"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> You then, as part of that search, did something personal, of which you were found guilty later on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2003"><a name="pos2003"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Yes, I did, I stole a leather jacket.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2004"><a name="pos2004"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Can you tell the committee why did you do it, or what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2005"><a name="pos2005"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> With the robbery, it wasn't just myself, it was Matthew's as well, Matthew's stole the cassettes, as well as the tools.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2006"><a name="pos2006"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Was that part of the planning, part of the instruction that you received, that you must do such a thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2007"><a name="pos2007"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> No, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2008"><a name="pos2008"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Can you explain how it happened that you committed this crime?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2009"><a name="pos2009"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I did it in a moment of madness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2010"><a name="pos2010"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Are you sorry about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2011"><a name="pos2011"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Yes, yes I am sorry that I stole that jacket.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2012"><a name="pos2012"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> The occupants of the Honda and Cressida were commanded or told to go and sit.   Can you explain on what they sat and where in relation to the vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2013"><a name="pos2013"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> There was a type of embankment on which they sat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2014"><a name="pos2014"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> This embankment, was that further away from the tar road as where the cars were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2015"><a name="pos2015"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2016"><a name="pos2016"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> In other words, it would have been to the left of the vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2017"><a name="pos2017"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2018"><a name="pos2018"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Where did you stand at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2019"><a name="pos2019"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> At that stage I stood just behind the Honda Ballade, Mr Chairperson, on the side of the tar road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2020"><a name="pos2020"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> In other words, the Honda was at that stage between you and the black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2021"><a name="pos2021"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> No, I stood on the side of the road of the Honda Ballade.   If you stand in front of the vehicle, on the right-hand side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2022"><a name="pos2022"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> That is why I ask you, and where were the black people then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2023"><a name="pos2023"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> The black people were on my left-hand side, they sat on the embankment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2024"><a name="pos2024"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2025"><a name="pos2025"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Certain questions were put to them, or Mr Martins asked them certain questions regarding what political party they belonged to.   He repeated his question, I don't remember how many times.   Mr Kloppers stood behind the people and would tap them over the head with this baton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2026"><a name="pos2026"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Did you hear the answers of these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2027"><a name="pos2027"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> No, I heard no answers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2028"><a name="pos2028"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> What happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2029"><a name="pos2029"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> A while later, Mr Etienne Visser came to me and said to me that I must prepare myself we're going to shoot and take that thing out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2030"><a name="pos2030"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Where did he come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2031"><a name="pos2031"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I cannot precisely say where he came from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2032"><a name="pos2032"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Who do you thought this instruction came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2033"><a name="pos2033"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I thought that it could only have been from the seniors, namely Chief Commander Martins, Chief Commander Kloppers and Commandant Martins.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2034"><a name="pos2034"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> What happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2035"><a name="pos2035"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> As Visser told it to you, Mr Visser and I moved around at the same time, we took our positions in and Mr Martins then shot the first shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2036"><a name="pos2036"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Before you continue, where did you station yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2037"><a name="pos2037"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> It was in front of the Honda Ballade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2038"><a name="pos2038"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And how can you say that it was Deon Martins who shot the first shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2039"><a name="pos2039"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I saw when the first shot rang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2040"><a name="pos2040"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And what happened afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2041"><a name="pos2041"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> After that shot was fired, everybody started shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2042"><a name="pos2042"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> What did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2043"><a name="pos2043"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> My pipe shotgun was loaded, I fired one round in the direction of the people, I turned it around, I put another round in it, and also fired off the other round in the direction of the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2044"><a name="pos2044"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Why did you fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2045"><a name="pos2045"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I only executed an order that was given to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2046"><a name="pos2046"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> How much ammunition did you have with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2047"><a name="pos2047"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I had a belt full.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2048"><a name="pos2048"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> How many rounds are in there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2049"><a name="pos2049"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> I think it was 27 rounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2050"><a name="pos2050"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> What happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2051"><a name="pos2051"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> After the shooting someone shouted there's a vehicle on the way, certain people jumped into the Sentra, it was on its way, I shouted "Stop", I wanted to get in as well, I ran across the road and Chief Commandant Klopper then shouted that "We will meet you at the town hall".</p>
<p class="line" id="line2052"><a name="pos2052"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And you then got into the Sentra and drove to the town hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2053"><a name="pos2053"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> That's correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2054"><a name="pos2054"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And eventually where did you disperse that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2055"><a name="pos2055"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> From the town hall, we went to Jaco Badenhorst's parents' house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2056"><a name="pos2056"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> And then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2057"><a name="pos2057"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> There we waited for Chief Commander Kloppers, and later, a while later, Kloppers and Martins and Etienne Visser arrived.   Kloppers said to me that I have to go and look in front of the Mercedes on the passenger's seat, there's a bag, I must go and fetch it.   I did it.    I handed over the bag and out of the bag he took the ear of a black man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2058"><a name="pos2058"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Was there comments made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2059"><a name="pos2059"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> It was asked who fired shots, and everybody who had weapons with them said that they shot.  Mr Diedericks was not at Mr Badenhorst's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2060"><a name="pos2060"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Was comments made regarding the ear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2061"><a name="pos2061"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER SCHYFF:</span> Mr Kloppers showed us the ear and said that the next morning he will hand the ear over to General Oelofse.   From there on we went home.   I went with Kloppers and Visser also went with us.   We first dropped Visser off at his house and then Kloppers dropped me off at my house, where I handed him the pipe shotgun that he gave me that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2062"><a name="pos2062"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNOETZE:</span> Mr Chairman, I note that it is four o'clock.   I don't know until what time you mean to sit, but if you want to adjourn now, it is a convenient stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2063"><a name="pos2063"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think it's a convenient time to adjourn until tomorrow at half past nine.</p>
