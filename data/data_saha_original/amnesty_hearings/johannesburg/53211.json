I said that is fine he can go wherever he wishes to go, but he must make sure that he returns because there is that important matter we have to discuss, we have a mission to accomplish.  That was the last we saw each other, it was during the morning.  Then he left.\n\t\tI was then in the location for the duration of the day.  In the afternoon Mr Dube arrived and we were together.  We had arranged that we would meet, the two of us would meet on that Sunday.  As we were still sitting there, Sicelo arrived, that is myself and Mr Dube.  \n\t\tAt that time I had not informed Mr Dube that I had met Sicelo.  I then said that I should go and telephone Sipho and Precious.  I went into the house and I called them and I told them to be on standby because we were going to meet as the commander was present.\n\t\tWhen I came out of the house I found them standing outside and when I got to them the commander showed me something, a device that was broken and he said, do you see this and I said yes, and he said this is a transmitter which Sicelo had been carrying.\n\t\tThe situation at that time just changed, he said we should talk alone.  I told Sicelo to get into the house and then I asked from the commander what should be do now, because we had agreed before that if we ever meet up with him we should question him about his whereabouts, but now that there was this new element, the transmitter, the situation had changed.\n\t\tI said that it would be problematic to interrogate him, the option that would not present us with problems would be to eliminate him.  We thereafter called him and we left the house.  We went to Leolo(?), that is the three of us.  \n\t\tWhen we arrived there at Leolo it was about, it was just before dusk.  I then went to collect Sipho in Siboseng(?).  I left Dube and Sicelo there.  Thereafter we all went to Dube Extension.  When we arrived there I knew what my task was, it was to shoot him.
