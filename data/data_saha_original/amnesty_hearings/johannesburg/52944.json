And as a result thereof they arranged that they escape from prison to go to Zimbabwe and that also Mr Sapele to undergo training. \n\tMr Chairperson, it is therefore my submission that the applicant has complied with the requirements of Section 20(1) and also (2), that at the time he was quite acting on behalf of APLA at the time, which as I indicated was a publicly known political organisation which was engaged in the political struggle.  And that when he acted he did not act for personal gain nor out of malice but he bona fide acted on behalf of his organisation, which was PAC.\n\tMr Chairperson, Mr Sapele, one would argue that at the time he joined APLA and that is was only Mr Masilela who was a fully fledged member of APLA at the time, and Mr Masilela was in prison for that reason, being a member of APLA a what Mr Masilela did in prison was in continuation of his struggle to fight against the regime at the time.\n\tMr Chairperson, my argument is that Mr Sapele was in prison for criminal activities and he does not deny that and he does not deny that at the instance of Mr Masilela as he was serving his prison sentence, he was recruited by him.  At the time he acted and tried to escape from prison and committed robbery, he no longer involved in criminal activities.  At that time he acted as a member, as a supporter of PAC and an aspirant member of APLA, as what he did was trying to join APLA outside.  \n\tAnd as such what he did in that particular time, trying to escape from prison and the robbing of the money, the money which was going to be used as a mode of transport to their destination, which is they were going to Zimbabwe, they wanted to leave the country so they wanted money and that money was to be used in pursuance of that objective, that one of being part of the liberation struggle.\n\tAnd it is therefore my humble submission, Mr Chairperson, that the applicant has fulfilled the requirements of the Act and that he has made full disclosure with regard to his activities on the day in question and as he has been conferred to by Mr Masilela.  As such it is my humble request that this Committee should grant amnesty to Mr Sapele as applied unless the Committee wants me to address it on a specific point, Mr Chairperson.",

            "Thank you, Mr Chairman, Members of the Committee.\n\tMr Chairman, it is so interesting that my learned friend is trying to cloth the applicant, Mr Sapele, with clothes that he never had, the clothing of a political organisation.  Mr Chairman, I will just respond to what my learned friend has said, that will be my argument.\n\tMy learned friend has correctly used the word \"aspirant member\", that is a very important word.  In other words, if we have analyse the word \"aspirant member\", it means he was aspiring to become one, he was not one at that time when this robbery was committed. \n\tMr Chairman, even if it can be said that what Mr Sapele did he did under the instruction, as it was said he acted at the instance of Mr Masilela, Mr Chairman, the TRC Act knows no general amnesty or amnesty for a group of persons, it makes mention of individuals for specific offences.  It cannot be said that if Mr Masilela was an activist, which I do not dispute, and whatever he did can also be imputed onto Mr Sapele, that is untenable, completely untenable.\n\tMr Chairman, it has been stated to you and the Honourable Members of the Committee, that the offence committed by Mr Sapele whilst in prison, was in the interest of PAC.  One wonders as to what would PAC stand to gain by a person escaping out of jail.  That really brings a very big question mark.\n\tInasfar as the money is concerned, I don't see how it can be clothed with any political motive or motivation.  The evidence is very clear from both Mr Masilela as well as Mr Sapele that the money was for personal use and thus it cannot be said that it was intended to be in the interest of the PAC.\n\tMr Chairman, with the greatest of respect, I fail to understand how my learned friend could be so ambitious to cloth Mr Sapele with the provisions of the ACT.  And I want to move that no amnesty has been - no successful application for amnesty in this regard has been done.  Thank you.",

He was a supporter, there's no dispute about that.  A supporter in terms of the Act can apply for amnesty and that is what we are saying, that he was a supporter of PAC at the time and that was also his evidence, but an aspirant member of APLA ...(intervention)",

Because if one takes a look at his record, most of his recent past in prison, but he said he was a long time supporter of PAC, even before he met Mr Masilela.

One, Mr Chairperson, I wouldn't like to go to that argument as to what supporters should know and what they should not know.  I will leave it to the Committee.  But my position is that he has indicated that he was a supporter of the PAC at the time.\n\tAlso Mr Chairperson, one other aspect which has been raised by my learned friend, the question of that if the Committee accepts that he was a supporter then automatically what he did there was part and parcel of his conviction that he wanted to be a member of APLA. \n\tNow my point comes to the question of money, how the money was going to used, Mr Chairperson.  Mr Chairperson, I find a difficulty how he would isolate the question of taking of money and being a member of APLA, which is in regard to Mr Masilela and also supporter.  People were in jail, Mr Chairperson, and they wanted money to be used as a means of transport to get to their destination, which is going back to the liberation struggle.",

It's just as if you were saying, let's put the money aside, if they have highjacked a car there as a mode of escaping would you say that it was not part of the struggle to go and fight?\n\tI might use the words of one of the prominent members, the Vice-Chairman of the Amnesty Committee, Judge Wilson, he once said that when argument came when somebody shot at the policeman and he was running away from being arrested and it was argued that it cannot be said that running away from the policemen and shooting at them, you cannot say that that is  politically motivated.  And he asked a question: A person who is involved in the armed struggle, police are trying to arrest him so that they keep him in jail not to continue with the armed struggle, are you saying that it's not politically motivated to shoot at them so that they cannot arrest him?  \n\tNow my point is, if somebody escapes from prison, he wants money so that he successfully escapes from prison, would you say that it was not part of the struggle?
