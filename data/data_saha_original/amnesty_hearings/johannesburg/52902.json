            "With regard to the first applicant, I would like to submit to you that the applicant has made a full disclosure of the events which took place.\n\tThe facts which are established in this case, are that the deceased was shot and that the applicant himself sustained an injury in his arm, and clearly then, two shots were fired.  The applicant maintains that three shots were fired.  The third applicant says that there were three shots.\n\tThe ballistic report indicates that two empty shells were found as well as a bullet point, a projectile point.  With respect Honourable Chairperson, the first applicant's version that he went to Pretoria along with the other two applicants, and that this took place as a result of an order given by the BWB, the Boere Weerstandsbeweging, of which he was also a member of the BRL, those facts are undisputed.\n\tIt also appears further with respect that an aspect which is not argued is that the applicant upon arrest said that they were in Pretoria, that the police were aware of this, and that sketched what their intention was in Pretoria, the plan was to take firearms or weapons from guards who were doing duty, not to remove weapons from a safe, and that a fellow member in his ranks, Mr Van Rensburg, was aware of this and that they had reconnoitred that place together on a prior occasion.\n\tThe applicant performed military service at Devon Air Base and it appears also from the evidence given by the witness Mr Swart, that before these events took place, the police took occupation of the place, but the applicant was still under the impression that this was still an Air Force base as it was.\n\tIt is also indisputable that the members of the Air Force on guard duty, performed guard duty with automatic firearms, unlike the police.\n\tIf we look at the aspect that the applicant had already intended to take those weapons in Pretoria, but because of circumstances and there being too many guards, it was not a viable option, and he then decided upon the Air Base, and this supports his contention that the weapons were to be taken from guards and not a stockpile or an arsenal.\n\tHis action with regard to Devon, when he decided on the way back from Pretoria to stop at that place and take weapons, if one considers the applications of the fellow applicants, there is no indication that it would have been only to reconnoitre that place, but also to obtain weapons there.\n\tThe applicant's evidence with regard to the action there, as indicated from the beginning, supports his allegation that he entered the room and said that the people shouldn't try to be Rambo's.  Mr Swart conceded that this is possible. His evidence is that they were from a right-wing group and that they wanted guns.\n\tMr Swart maintains that he can't specifically remember that, that everything happened very quickly.  If one looks at the entire impact of his evidence with respect, there are many possibilities and understandably so, somebody who would suddenly find himself under such circumstances where he is being threatened with death, can absolutely not have a very clear picture of the events as they played out.\n\tIndeed during cross-examination concessions were made that as the applicants say things happened, they could very well have happened so.\n\tHonourable Chair and members of the Committee, it has continuously been the case of the applicant and unfortunately I don't have the judgment of Justice Grobbelaar with regard to the court case, initially I couldn't find it but I have found it, and I have photostatted it, however, it is in Pretoria, if you wish to obtain it, I could furnish you with these documents.

That is Section 20(1).\n\tAnd that aspect of satisfying the Committee indicates that the applicant should be able to convince the Committee and I refer to the word satisfy in the English text.  I can refer you to a number of judgments, but I am sure that at this stage you are aware of a number of the applications in which reference was made to the exact definition of the word satisfy as opposed to the definition of the word convinced.\n\tI can furnish the Committee with details of this if need be.  \n\tI can also do this by setting out the necessary aspects.

Honourable Chairperson, then in so far as the prerequisites for amnesty are concerned, the applicant in this case, falls under Section 20(2)(d) of the Act with reference to Section 20(2)(3)(a), it is my argument that the motive of the person who committed the acts, omission or offence is very clear.\n\tAt that stage, according to the applicant, there was a war, the BWB had declared war, and the objective was to obtain weapons for the purposes of its warfare and if one looks at the judgment of Justice Wunch, page 38 of the bundle, approximately line 7, the evidence is and can be seen that at the time of the offence, the country was in hysteria.\n\tThis is with regard to the two other applicants' judgments.  The motive was clearly political and not at all based upon malice or any other reason.  The context in which the offence was committed and more specifically the deed itself, as set out in the Act with regard to political objective, I submit that this falls in with what the order of the applicant was, what the applicant was supposed to do and what the BWB actually stood for.\n\tI would like to refer you Honourable Chairperson, to the amnesty application of L.H. Froneman and P.J. Harmse.  This was served to Justice Wilson, and Mr De Jager.  I think the third person was - just a moment please - Ms Khampepe.  In that specific case, these two persons Froneman and Harmse were members of the BWB and they were also members of the BRL and also in the same way as the applicant has submitted to you how he received his order telephonically and was to carry it out, this is analogous to this particular application, and is set out in the application.

It was disassembled and thrown away, so it was a total failure.\n\tEven the Pretoria trip was totally futile, because they drove all the way there, and when they arrived there it became apparent that it was a mad plan as the applicant had said, it was madness.\n\tSome of the applicants had made the point that they thought it was a head over heels trip and terms like fanatical was used, and some other terms as well.  It is quite apparent that it wasn't a smoothly planned operation that took place there, where everybody of the persons who were participating would have known exactly what his role was to be?\n\tThey drove to Pretoria, they had a difference of opinion there amongst themselves.  The first applicant said let's eliminate these people and the other said no, but you are mad.  How can we safely attack the Defence Headquarters where there is a number of guards on duty.\n\tSo it definitely doesn't strike one as a finely planned, well oiled instruction which was being carried out, and as I had stated, some of the applicants themselves, referred and used the term head over heels in this process, when referring to this process, so is it totally unjustified then to refer to the operation in those terms, according to your submission?",

There were many instances where innocent people were the victims.\n\tWe can think of the Pretoria bomb, of the bus in Durban where people fired on a bus with totally innocent people riding in it.  There was not even a matter of testimony that they had anything to do with the difficulty that occurred on the beach. \n\tThen if we look at the Heidelberg Tavern where they said One Settler, One Bullet, but the people who were killed, were people of the coloured group, the Indian group and the white group who were killed.\n\tWith respect Mr Chair, it is a set of unfortunate circumstances that that person had to be the victim under the circumstances there.  But that in itself cannot be to the detriment of the fact that the objective was to find firearms for the struggle and that this could have been done in a way that also included violence.\n\tThen we have to go over and look at proportionality and what aspect it contributed there, and then I would like to argue that the proportionality with regard to this what had to be achieved, and that we have to keep in mind, is that this person wanted to rob an automatic firearm.  The fact that things went wrong, cannot change that objective.\n\tIf we look at the facts, the applicant said he entered, he asked the persons to hand over the rifles, that they mustn't try to be Rambo's.  According to him, the deceased got up, lifted his firearm, he grabbed him, the applicant himself was wounded.\n\tThat stands above any doubt and after that, he fired a shot which fatally wounded the deceased, who was killed in that action then.  If one compares that for example with the case which I had just referred to, just a moment's patience please, Harmse and Froneman's case.  In that case Harmse and Froneman on the command of their superiors went and planted a bomb on the stoep of a shop where they wanted to kill the owner, it was aimed against the Muslim community.\n\tAn innocent policeman who came to investigate, kicked against the drum in which the drum was contained, and the policeman was killed, and they were granted amnesty for that.\n\tIf one looks at the proportionality and the objective involved there, the person was an innocent victim just like Terreblanche, and it is exactly the same.  If one were to look at the case of the Heidelberg Tavern, the application of Gqomfa, H.L. - I can give you copies of those then I don't have to read out all the names, but in that particular case, it was also found that the purpose had been the attack on the Heidelberg Tavern was a particularly brutal one.  It appears from the evidence and the other information available to us, that the Tavern was a place largely used by students and other young people, and those who made use of its facilities, were not only members of the white community, that is the people frequently referred to as Settlers by APLA members.  Of the three young ladies killed, only one was white, the other was coloured and the third was an Indian.\n\tIt is quite clear that they intended to kill as many people as possible. Evidence was that nails had been glued onto one of the grenades to increase the lethal effect of the explosion.  After arrival at the Tavern, shots were fired into the Tavern, using automatic weapons and the rifle grenade was fired, which did not explode.\n\tThe attack took only a few minutes, and the attackers then retreated to the car.  Whilst they were driving away, they gained the impression that shots were being fired at them, by persons in the vicinity of the Tavern.  They opened fire on the persons they saw on the road, and in the process killed Nicolene Cerqueira, the deceased referred to in count 8.\n\tShots were also fired in the vicinity of Benjamin Joseph Brodi, referred to in count 9, who was working with Cerqueira.\n\tThe applicants also gave evidence as to the political objectives of APLA, which was basically to take back the land by force.  They all made it clear that they did not see it as their function to question how the operations carried out by them, would achieve this.  This was left to the leaders, and they merely carried out orders as has already been said.\n\tWith respect Mr Chair, the applicants carried out an instruction which they had received.

In the case of the St James church, I would like to refer you to that specific judgment on page 2 of the judgment.\n\tIt was contended by the objectors that the attack on St James was not an APLA or PAC operation as it was denied by APLA's Director of Information, Majosi - at a time inferred that Barney Desaai of the PAC had at that time, accused the Third Force of mischievously connecting the attack to a PAC military wing in order to derail negotiations which were then under way and to which the PAC was a participant.\n\tIn considering this contention, we had to be mindful of the fact that many political parties on the liberation movements, might have denied any involvement in any incident, because they might have considered it strategically important and politically wise and expedient to do so and that accordingly the alleged utterances must be viewed against the political background that existed at the time.\n\tIn our view, it was of cardinal importance in the fact that both the PAC and APLA have acknowledged in their submissions to the TRC in 1996 and 1997 respectively, that the St James attacks was one of the authorised operations carried out by APLA.\n\tWith respect, the issue is that at the time of the committing of this deed at the St James church, there was no - this is also apparent in the Amy Biehl case.

            "As it pleases you Chairperson.  Chairperson, I know that you have been referred to page 98 of the record, and with your leave, I would like as starting point, to use this aspect of the record, where the Judge who heard this particular case of the second and third applicant, after hearing all the evidence, came to the following conclusion\n\tThe evidence is that at the time of this offence, the country was in a state of hysteria, certain aspects of the population were behaving in an insane way and it is clear that you would not very easily commit such a deed again and I am going to refer to the following sentences.\n\tYou will excuse me if I say of you that it appears to me that you are people with reference to the second and third applicant, who are easily influenced, and who are not extremely intelligent.  This has also contributed to your participation in this expedition.\n\tI respectfully submit that the applications of the second and third applicants comply with the prerequisites of the Truth and Reconciliation Act as contained in Section 20(1)(a), secondly that this was a deed with a political objective, or which was connected to a political objective and was committed within the context of the past.  \n\tI submit in reference to the following, that this attack took place four days before the 1994 elections.  At that stage the political situation was incredibly insecure and very tense.  Certain communities or parts of these communities and political groupings in general, tried to intimidate one another, or feared violence.\n\tThe memorable Shell House incident took place a number of days before this, and for everybody it was clear that automatic weaponry had been used during this incident.  This was also confirmed during other preceding incidents.\n\tIt was clear that the SAP was not able to protect the general public.  Furthermore I indicate that the applicants lived in an isolated mining community in Secunda, where they also worked and relied  on their background that communism was threatening their lifestyle and values, and based upon this, months before the elections, onslaught was launched on their thought patterns by the AWB and other right-wing organisations.\n\tBecause of a variety of factors, including the isolation of the area, the proximity of black neighbouring towns and the attitudes of the white villages, there was a fear psychosis among the inhabitants of this town, as well as the applicants.\n\tThe general public gathered supplies for emergencies, but were not aware of the urgency of the situation in places like Secunda.  The applicants among others, received notices in page 59 and further and I quote, people, sorry, this is a necessity, you and your family have to flee.  There is no time to pack and then this circular concludes with help us to plan, we need help.  May God help and preserve us.\n\tThis circular letter represents the atmosphere which reigned in Secunda particularly before this incident and it is clear that the applicants took these warnings thoroughly  to heart.\n\tThe second and third applicants, like many other people, believed that on the election day, they would be attacked.  As part of planning, safe houses were developed in order to protect women and children.  The second and third applicant undertook night shooting and convoy training courses because it was feared that such incidents in which vehicles would be attacked, would indeed take place.\n\tFrom the entire evidence it is clear in which atmosphere the applicants found themselves.  This atmosphere was created by a broader political condition.  The applicants' application must be seen within the broader context and situations, which existed back then.\n\tI submit that by isolating certain situations, it would not give enough consideration to this atmosphere which reigned at that stage.  I submit that the wording, a deed which was committed and is connected to a political objective, indicates that the crime did not necessarily have to be connected with politics, but that it is related to it.  \tIt is my submission that the legislation has given a greater spectrum to this.  It is not necessary then if I state it plainly, to be politically motivated in your crimes with an AWB badge in the one hand, and a stone in the other.",

            "It is clear from the evidence, that the applicants were members of the AWB which organisation was a political organisation, which waged a political struggle against the State or a generally known a political organisation and freedom movement.\n\tMy submission is furthermore that the applicants acted bona fide in order to promote the struggle as stated in Section 20(2)(a).  In order to determine whether the deed for which application is made for amnesty, was a deed which related to a political objective, I have to respectfully refer briefly to the following:\n\tFirstly the motive was clearly to obtain automatic weapons.\n\tSecondly the context within which it occurred, had been sketched and the arms would have been used as part of a political uprising or event or in reaction thereto.\n\tThirdly, the factual nature is that the applicants received an instruction from Colonel Van Schalkwyk, their Officer in Command, together with De Meillon who had been introduced to them as a Commandant in the BWB and Boere Republikeinse Leer with further impression that he knew what to do, to cooperate with him, and under his command.  To participate in a Boere Republikeinse Leer operation.\n\tThe second and third applicants were partially misled or misinformed regarding the task they had to fulfil, but in the bona fide belief that their action was tied up to a political objective, the undeniable act was that Mr De Meillon who at that stage was only 21 years of age, was their Commander, was confirmation of the fact that they acted within AWB and BRL structures in carrying out instructions within a definite command structure.\n\tThey were found guilty on the basis that they had the shared intention with De Meillon and that they had dolus eventualis as part of their objective.  It is also further common cause that Mr Van Zyl just waited in the car during these events.\n\tI would also like to point out and submit that it should be taken into consideration very thoroughly that the action of that night, took a totally different course from what had originally been planned.\n\tThe fact that they didn't search for automatic weapons in the guard house or that Swart's pistol was not taken, confirm this submission.  The fact that Swart informed the Committee and the Committee was privileged to hear him personally, it was clear that there was adequate time to do him personal harm or injure or kill him, if that had been the intention.\n\tIf that had been the case that Mr Holder had taken his firearm from his holster, the fact that it was doubted, the question was why Mr Holder wouldn't have taken it then.  I wish to submit that if one looks at the broader picture, it is clear that this action had taken a totally different course from that which the second and third applicants had believed, it would take.\n\tThe question as to whether it was justified for the sake of one pistol, to kill a policeman in this case I would submit respectfully, is not the question that should be asked because the initial planning which from the point of view of the second and third applicant, had been made, would never have involved the killing of a person for the sake of a single pistol.\n\tApplicants Holder and Van Zyl, at all times believed that they would obtain a large quantity of arms, with relatively little threat to life.  It is also clear that the action had been planned against a political opponent, but that it was actually carried out against government employees.\n\tIt was not doubted in this application, that Commandant Van Schalkwyk had given an instruction that Messrs Holder and Van Zyl had to assist Mr De Meillon in the operation.  If the broader political circumstances were to be taken into consideration, the attempt to obtain automatic weapons three days before the elections, should be regarded to be in direct relationship to their political objectives and if not directly, then at least, closely.\n\tIf one looks at it objectively, the killing of one person cannot be justified by obtaining a single side arm.  But then one has to keep in mind the total objective.\n\tI also with to argue further that we are not busy here with pure arguments regarding self-defence, etc, and what is involved, what is justified and what is not justified.  One has to look at their objective, more than at the actual eventual result, and if it is a factor to be taken into consideration, it shouldn't be a decisive factor.\n\tI furthermore respectfully submit that the applicants Holder and Van Zyl, had disclosed all the relevant facts fully.  Mr Holder was criticised because of an amendment which he had made to a paragraph.  I would like to respectfully submit that before he had testified, this aspect had already been pointed out and furthermore, the date of his application confirms that it had been finalised by a legal team in a few days before the deadline, by a legal team that were not involved in the court a quo and that the applicant also found himself in prison, and that he had to be consulted regarding a wide variety of facts in a very limited time by that team.\n\tI also would like to point out that Mr Holder had been criticised for example, regarding the completion of question 8 in the amnesty application, where he said he would have completed it himself, and the suggestion had been why he hadn't disclosed that he had done military service. It is clear that the form as contained on page 16 of the bundle, had been typed and that it had not been completed by Mr Holder in the first instance.\n\tThe criticism against Mr Holder is therefore with respect, not valid.  The question asked in 8(a) is if you are/were an Officer or office bearer or employee of the State or any former State or if you are or were a member of the Security Forces of the State, or any former State, state the Department/Division and then the answer there is not applicable.\n\tThis would just have referred a statement of his military involvement if it had been under the banner of the South African Defence Force or some other Security Force under whose banner the action was carried out.  What is important is in question 7(a) where he indicated that he committed this operation, or carried out this operation under the banner of the AWB.  That criticism I would respectfully submit, was not justified.\n\tMr Holder was also criticised because in his supplementary affidavit he hadn't made this correction.  The documentation indicate that additional questions had been asked in terms of which additional information was obtained, and the supplementary affidavit was clearly just in answer to the additional information that was required and the applicant had clearly not been invited to make previous corrections or to rectify previous corrections.\n\tI would therefore submit that it should be taken into consideration, particularly where Mr Swart acted as a witness, and his testimony was tested.  It was also clear that Mr Holder in his corrected version, actually fitted in with Mr Swart's evidence.\n\tThe question which also arose is how it was possible that Mr Holder would just have heard one shot, whereas the other witnesses heard two or three and I would respectfully submit that Mr Swart's evidence also confirmed and clearly elucidates this fact, that a shot fired in a confined space would have a deafening and stupefying effect and if this happens under extremely stressful circumstances, it is quite apparent that Mr Holder's impression of a number of shots fired, cannot be a deduction of a lack of truthfulness.\n\tI would also like to point out that at a stage from the sideline sort of, I would almost call it, in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act, Section 212, that a .38 Special projectile had been found on the scene.  The exact implication is not that it had been found there, but just that it would have been analysed and found to be a .38 Special projectile.\n\tI would like to point out that there is no nexus that can be placed before this Committee, or had been placed, to say exactly where this projectile had been found, by whom, what the circumstances had been and whether it had indeed been a .38 Special projectile or bullet.\n\tIt was contested during the trial of Messrs Van Zyl and Holder, whether this alleged .38 projectile which would have established serious evidence against Mr Holder, was never placed before the Court, and in the proceedings of the court a quo, it was never alleged that Mr Holder had indeed fired a shot in the guard house.\n\tGiven the evidence of Constable Swart today, Swart says that his impression was that Mr Holder had not fired a shot.  The first shot would have been fired while the light was on.  At that stage, he would have been right close to Mr Holder, within arm's length with Mr Holder on his left, while they were looking at Messrs Terreblanche and De Meillon.\n\tIf the first shot had been fired by Holder, he would have known it, he should have known it.  I would therefore submit that the testimony of Mr Swart is a strong indication that Mr Holder had indeed not fired a shot there.\n\tAlthough the Section 212 certificate which was basically robbed of all its value in the fact that it was not used in the trial, certainly casts doubt on this whole aspect.  I would submit that a finding of a lack of truthfulness against Mr Holder, cannot be made on the basis of this aspect.\n\tMr Chair, I would also like to point out that the only aspect in Mr Swart's evidence which does not agree with Mr Holder's evidence, is the matter of whether Mr Holder had a revolver with him in the guard house, or not.\n\tIf Mr Holder had indeed entered the guard house with the object of doing harm to anybody there, in contrast with his evidence that he had actually wished to defuse the situation, which had taken an unexpected change, I would like to submit that if he had done so male fide, he would have acted more aggressively towards Mr Swart.\n\tMr Swart's evidence furthermore that Mr Holder was the second person who would have entered, confirm Mr Holder's version.  The fact that he confirmed that Mr Holder at the time of this whole action, never made any remarks or statements, confirm that Mr Holder was not the initiator of this action, and I would respectfully submit that there is no reason to find that Mr Holder had not made a full disclosure regarding the material facts.\n\tIt is clear that as far as the death of Mr Terreblanche is concerned, Mr De Meillon had accepted responsibility for that, and if the broader picture were to be considered, it is clear that Mr Holder was only playing a supporting role in that situation as a misguided or confused person.",

That is the type of deduction that Mr Swart makes.\n\tI say that with respect, but that is what he was prepared to make as far as his deductions are concerned.  If you asked if he had seen Mr Holder taking it from his holster, he says he couldn't, but when he testified, he was very certain about that.\n\tWhen he was asked whether firm pressure had been exerted on his left shoulder, it appeared as if he wished to agree with it, but when he was asked how movement could have taken place, then it is clear that Mr Swart is very uncertain about these aspects.\n\tFor Mr Swart for example to allege that that very limited time span under those stressful circumstances with Mr Holder with a vest without holes for the eyes, he had been able to see Mr Holder's eye colour, I would submit respectfully that it wasn't possible.\n\tI would like to submit that Mr Swart in the brief time that he had been here before the Committee, had proven himself to be somebody with a very quick imagination, who also from time to time, was able to change his evidence.\n\tI can refer you to where he had said in the first court case that he had initially thought that it was a joke and that he had smiled.  My instructions had been that what had happened at Mr Holder and Van Zyl's court case, he didn't want to agree with what he had said at the first trial where he had said he had smiled when they entered.\n\tI would like to submit honestly that even though Mr Swart hadn't been cross-examined very long, it had become thoroughly clear that he was attempting to make a reconstruction of the events and for him to agree and that is a suggestion that I am making to the Committee, for him as a trained police officer to say that he had done nothing there, while nobody was aiming a firearm at him, that is just asking a bit too much from a policeman.\n\tHe also had to justify his actions, and what is easier that to say firearms were aimed at our head, and when Mr Prinsloo then undertook an investigation of this aspect, under cross-examination it became clear the fact that he had said that a firearm had also been aimed at Mr Terreblanche's head.  That was not proved correct.\n\tI think that is enough evidence that we have no reason  to take the point of departure of Mr Winch, Judge Winch, to accept Mr Swart as a totally dependable, or very dependable witness, because if this Committee were to make its own judgment regarding the dependability or truthfulness of Mr Swart, I would say we have to reject this aspect.\n\tShould it not be rejected, I would submit that it doesn't mean that Mr Holder as an applicant, should be found to be untruthful or not having made a full disclosure of the events.\n\tIt is very clear that everything that happened in the guard house, took place in a very brief period of time, under circumstances where various people made various observations regarding what had happened, and even if he had testified erroneously in this regard, it does not mean that he is deliberately misleading the Committee in this regard.",

I would submit that the probabilities support Mr Van Zyl and Mr Holder's version.\n\tThe idea that a white policeman would be shot and killed for the sake of a single pistol, was a  thought that clearly was not acceptable to them.\n\tThe fact that shortly after the incident, they had sworn off, that they had given up their right-wing connections, is a very strong indication of the disappointment that they had felt - that is Messrs Van Zyl and Holder, regarding this particular incident.\n\tI would also respectfully submit and point out that it is clear that Messrs Van Zyl and Holder regarded Mr Van Schalkwyk as their Commanding Officer, Mr De Meillon was held up to them as a dependable person, he knew what he was doing, who had already observed targets and the impression was created that they could openly without any reservation, go along with him, and that an excessive operation would not be planned and executed.\n\tTo lay it before their door that in the two hour trip from Secunda to Pretoria, they at that stage did not start asking who would play what role and when, I would also submit that it is not justified to do so.\n\tAt that stage, they didn't even know exactly what their target was. One would have expected them, when they arrived at the target, perhaps to just first drive passed, make an observation.  Perhaps then walk passed and do another observation, and then perhaps to come to a final planning and execution of the plan.\n\tTo expect of them that they would have to take this specialist De Meillon and to question him, would given the fact that they were mere members of the AWB who had been sent as assistants, would just be asking too much.  Their impressions were clearly that Commandant De Meillon when it suited him, would pass onto them the information which they might require in order to carry out the operation.\n\tWhen indeed he disclosed to them the Pretoria target and found themselves in a position to make an evaluation of the risk involved, they immediately indicated that it was not part of the planning.  The fact of the matter is that because they had not attacked those guards, it is clear that the second and third applicants did not have any expectation whatsoever, that this was the type of thing that would have happened.  It had been in Mr De Meillon's mind that automatic weapons would be taken from guards, is clear, but the fact that it didn't happen, is clear proof that it didn't fit in with Mr Holder and Mr Van Zyl's agenda.\n\tI would therefore like to state that the problem should further be looked at from a different perspective and that is they drove back from Pretoria, De Meillon is the respected and appreciated Commander of the BRL, he had been instructed to find weapons, and now he is on his way to Secunda from Pretoria, with empty hands.\n\tIf on a Saturday night, before the elections, when everybody believes there is a civil war confronting them, and he would turn up with empty hands at his command structure, what a fool he wouldn't be made of under those circumstances?\n\tSo Mr De Meillon looks at alternative planning and on route back to Secunda, he thought of Devon.  He discloses it to his co-applicants, that Devon is an area well known to him.  There were also automatic weapons.  The applicants at all times believed that there wouldn't just be a blind attack that would follow.  It is a place that had to be reconnoitred properly.",

My instructions are that this was for three days after he had obtained it and that he then had received  instructions from Mr Flippie Maree, a Lieutenant in the AWB, to act in terms of this weapon, as has been testified.\n\tIf one looks at it then, one can say this is a total flop or failure, but I would respectfully like to point out that Mr Van Zyl as an ordinary member without any rank, from his perspective, was confronted with the fact, he had a weapon, he kept it.  The fact that Mr Maree or whichever other person or persons,  and whatever might have motivated them, I don't know, had made the decision that this firearm now had to be disassembled and thrown away, Mr Van Zyl didn't make any contribution to this and he didn't play a role in this decision.\n\tIn totality when one looks at the evidence, it is also apparent that this was an action where one could easily say let's go and obtain firearms, but nobody thought any further and said how many crimes may we commit in the course of doing so?

            "As it pleases you.  I will address you very briefly regarding the matter.\n\tMost of the matters have been discussed by the Honourable Chairperson.  I stand by the affidavit made by the family of Mr Terreblanche which opposes the applications of all three applicants, and we continue to oppose these applications.\n\tThen briefly, I would like to move to Section 2(a) of Act 35 of 1995, I have a problem with the specific political objective which was sought.  The applicants come here and say that they wanted to use the weapon for security and they don't have any concrete reasons.\n\tCoupled to that is the motive for stealing these weapons.  Can we truly say that there is a political objective in stealing weapons for security reasons.\n\tThey have the onus to prove to us when they say that their organisations were involved in a war with the State, or then with any other political organisation.  However, they don't prove this.  There are not dates, times, places of combat, or any declarations.  They bring to us facts which cannot be further substantiated.\n\tFurthermore with regard to paragraph 3(e), I have a serious problem with the command structure of these persons.  There is no clear issuing of instructions, there is no clear offensive training or exercising of any plans and the only exercise was defensive exercise.\n\tThere is no clear command structure, there is no clear structure of reporting back to the command structure, and I cannot find any clear plan which any organisation would have, which had been planning actions such as these.\n\tThe applicants in the matter may have called various of these Generals, Van Schalkwyk or Van Rensburg or any others, they don't do this.  The duty rests with them, to prove to us that these orders were issued.  Why aren't they open-hearted?  Why don't they call these Commanders who were the ones who gave the orders, and to whom they would have reported.\n\tThe only inference to be drawn out of this, is negative.  That these persons did not at all give these orders.  In truth it is my submission that this is an action by a couple of people who had been having a party after a rugby game, and decided in the heat of the moment to commit the deed.\n\tIf we discuss the open-heartedness and the full disclosure of facts made by the applicants, all three of them were placed under cross-examination and specifically asked whether they believed that the other applicant was telling lies or was not open-hearted.  The first applicant indicated that where the other applicants would differ from him, they would be lying or would not be open-hearted.\n\tThen we pertinently asked applicants 2 and 3 whether they felt that applicant 1 had been open-hearted and honest, but these applicants testified that applicant 1 had not been open-hearted.\n\tTherefore we have two versions where applicants 2 and 3, they clearly tell us that applicant 1 is wrong.  The applicants have the onus to come to us with open-heartedness and honesty and I cannot decide what was the truth and what was the lie.\n\tWe have either one or one and two, one of whose evidence has to be rejected.    Should the officials decide to accept the evidence of applicants 2 and 3, it would mean that I have a further problem with regard to the incident within the guard house.\n\tHere we have a clear distinction between applicant 1 and applicants 2 and 3's versions.  It is very clear that applicant 1 does not support applicant 2's version that the firearm was in his pocket.  If we have to believe applicant 1, then his evidence would be in line with Constable Swart's.  It is clear that the argument of applicant 2's legal representative is for us to reject Swart's evidence, but within this room, Swart and applicant 2's evidence are in agreement, and it is clear that applicant 2 is not honest.\n\tI would like it to be noted that Mr Swart was found to be an open-hearted and honest witness in front of the Judge a quo.  It is a considerable amount of time now since the last time that he testified, and I would like to point out that his evidence was very brief.  The Judge and the Court had the opportunity to consider all the facts, which we have not had.\n\tAnd they also had the opportunity to ... (tape ends) ... examination of Constable Swart, an opportunity which we have not had here.\n\tIf we look at the role of applicant 2, it is clear that he brought about changes to his affidavit at a very late stage.  An explanation is given for that, and I ask the Committee to reject this explanation.\n\tHe had two other opportunities to amend his statement, and it is my submission that this was done at the eleventh hour in order for his story to fit in with the versions of the other two applicants.\n\tI therefore request that all three applicants' evidence be rejected in its entirety because it is impossible for us to determine which one of the three applicants' submissions to us, is open-hearted and honest.\n\tIf you should find that the submission of applicant 3 is honest, and you reject applicant 1's submission, I would like to address you with regard to the issue of proportionality with the incident.\n\tThis is of application to all three applicants, but especially so for applicant 3 in the matter.  This deed was disproportionately violent without any specific objective which could be sought with regard to a certain political person or a political situation.\n\tThere was no propaganda value in shooting this police officer.  Only one hand weapon which was taken apart and thrown away in a dam, was the objective and ultimate result of this action.\n\tWhether or not it went wrong, does not change this point.  Had it been successful and a policeman had been shot dead, what would have happened to these weapons?  You identified yourself with this possibility.\n\tAccused 3 was in the position that he was the keeper of this weapon for three days.  With the election which was shortly at hand, he took the weapon apart and threw it away.  It would not be the conduct of a politician or a radically right-wing member of an organisation. This is the work of a terrorist who is trying to protect himself and his other criminal cohorts.\n\tTherefore this deed was not proportionate to any kind of political objective and his conduct after the fact is that of one who was acting like a criminal in order to disguise the situation.\n\tWith regard to Mr Terreblanche and his father, I would like to add the following.  What happened to my son was the result of an action against a military base and not the State.",

One must bear in mind that the evidence was that AWB members had a standard order to always be in possession of their legal firearms.\n\tIt is clear that the AWB members in general were very well armed.  The question originates, would anybody really have the need to have two firearms?  They have a hand weapon, they don't need any more, they have enough of their own.  This item could have led to the identification of people who were definitely sought, because of their connection to a crime.  That is why the structure of command decided to destroy it, and I submit therefore with respect, that criminals indeed would keep a weapon like this, and criminals would definitely make use of these items in other criminal activities. \n\tThat was not the case here, and therefore that inference is not justified.
