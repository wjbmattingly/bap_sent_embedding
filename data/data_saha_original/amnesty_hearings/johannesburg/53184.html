<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NHLAYISI:</span> Mr Chairman, it concludes my applications for the day.  My colleague, Mr Sibeko will be taking over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Mr Chairman, the applicant is Mr Thami Mahlala.  His application appears on page 72.  The application number is AM7628/97.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where is he Mr Sibeko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> He is with Prison Authorities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Steenkamp, will you see to it that the shackles are taken off while they are sitting in this hall please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, I actually have informed Prison Authorities previously.  I know in the previous hearings you have informed me similarly.  I informed them, I don't know why it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Keep an eye on it please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> I do apologise Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibeko, what is the position with his ID number?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Mr Chairman, Mr Mahlala informed me that he never possessed any ID book before, as a result he doesn't have any identity document, he only knows his birth date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> The date of birth is the 28th of October 1970.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You better inform him if he intends to vote, he better have an ID document with a bar code.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> I will do so Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mahlala, what language would you prefer to use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">THAMI MAHLALA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would your incarceration at the moment, have anything to do with your application?  In other words are you serving sentence for the acts and offences for which you are now applying for amnesty or is it for something else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> I am in jail because of the incident that took place in the township, the incident that I am applying for surely.  I am applying for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibeko, I don't know if the applicant understood me correctly, because I didn't quite follow his answer.  Are you able to tell me whether he is in prison solely for the acts for which he applies for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Mr Chairman, those are my instructions.  All the acts that he has been sentenced for, and other acts that he is applying for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibeko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR SIBEKO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, the applicant applies for amnesty for murder, one count of murder, one count of attempted murder, one count of armed robbery, unlawful possession of firearms, one count.  I don't have the number, but it is a number of arms and one count of attempted escape from lawful custody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would that be for political reasons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Mr Chairman, the facts relating to it, will indicate that it was somewhat political.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am going to be very interested to hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> May I proceed?  Sir, were you a member of the Self Defence Unit in Tokoza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, I was within the Youth Congress in Tokoza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Yes, were you at any stage part of the Self Defence Unit in Tokoza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Which Section were you operating as a member of the Self Defence Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Slovo Section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> When did you join the Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> In 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> At that time, who was your Commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> My Commander was Levi, his assistant was Jamani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Now, do you by any chance have other names for Levi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Molefi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Sir, do you confirm that the offences that I have read out, are the offences that you are applying for amnesty for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, I confirm that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Right, on page 73 paragraph 9(a), you indicate that the acts or omissions or offences is possession of illegal firearms, murder and stolen vehicle and the dates you refer to as the 30th October 1992, do you have any problems in letting us know what actually happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> No, I don't have a problem.  I can explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Proceed sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> On the 29th of October 1992, it was in the morning, Levi came to me.  He asked me, saying that I should accompany him to go to where we were going to fetch a car and go out on our way to collect firearms.  Therefore we went to Alrode.  We arrived at Alrode, we sat there.  People were getting in buying things, getting in and out and one man who was wearing a two piece, got out of the place and got into a car.  As he was about to start his car, Levi approached him and pointed a firearm at him, and I was already close to that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>	He raised up his hands inside the car, he opened the car and went out.  We got into the car and I climbed in the passenger seat.  We went back to the township.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> You say on that particular morning ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that the robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the robbery of the motor vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Now you say on that particular morning, Levi who happens to be Molefi, and you said he was your Commander, came to your place, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, he came to me as a Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> You said he told you that you have to go to Alrode in order to get the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> And then you say the car that you were actually looking for, should be a company car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> It will be a company car, any Contractor's car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Then when you arrived, you waited until you saw one man who was there to buy something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, we arrived and waited at the place and we were waiting for any car which belonged to Contractors or a company and it so happened that this gentleman got out and got into this particular car and as I explained before, we pointed a firearm at him, he raised his hands.  We got in and we drove to the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> The person who got into the car, after this man alighted, is it Mlefi?  Is it Levi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is Levi also known as Mlefi?  Is that his proper name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> You occupied the passenger seat and then you left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, I was sitting on the passenger seat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> What was the purpose of you getting this  motor vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> The purpose for acquiring this car, was to use it to go to Duduza, to go and fetch firearms.  My Commander had already informed me that there is some operation that we had to do, but we have to first go and collect firearms and carry out the work in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Right, you got the car, what happened thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> We took the car and kept it somewhere.  In the evening Levi came together with Jamani and Vusi.  They found me outside, they called me and I approached them.  In front it was Levi who was driving and Jamani was the passenger and Vusi was sitting at the back and I got at the back together with Vusi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>	We drove to Duduza and when we arrived in Duduza, Levi came out of the car.  He got out of the car and he said to Vusi are you armed with a firearm, and Vusi said yes.   He said if ever we got attacked, we protect ourselves with these firearms.  He went into one shack and one man by the name of Zinto came out.  This person came to meet Levi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>	I know this person because I met him once in the township.  At a particular moment, they both went into that shack.  Levi came out, holding a bag.  He opened the door and threw it into the front seat of the car and he said to us, if anything disturbs us on the way, we will have to fight, because if we had to arrive in the township without the firearms, they will say we have misused the funds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>	He got into the car, started the car and we left.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> We left and before we arrived at Vosloorus, we found a roadblock.  We had to turn back.  We turned back and we stopped at Dawn Park and parked our car under a light.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>	We started discussing as to how we were going to do it.  We had to decide whether we should wait until the roadblock is over or we should use another route, and before the lapse of time, about three or five minutes, another car came and stopped from behind.  It was a private car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Vusi was outside at the time, busy urinating.  Vusi said they are cocking their arms, and before he could finish - Vusi heard them cocking the firearm and we also heard the sound of firearms, we looked at them and thereafter we heard a fire shot. It looked like they were firing at us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>	We took cover.  Levi got into the car, he pulled out his firearm.  Vusi also shot.  Those people shot at us and he fell down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who fell down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Vusi fell down.  I took the firearm from Vusi, we heard the sound of an AK47 and as we were shooting them, we suspected that, we didn't know that they were police, because they were dressed in private clothes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>	In my mind, while shooting at them, I thought, I remembered that my Commander said that we should find any disturbance on the way, and I thought it was the soldiers who were at the roadblock and they have seen us, so I shot at them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> I was trying to protect the firearms that we had, because our Commander has informed us that we should arrive at the township with the firearms and we should do anything to protect them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you were acting in terms of a command as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes.  We exchanged fire, some police arrived and we fired each other, and I tried to cover.  At that time, I was shot and I woke up in hospital.  I don't remember what happened thereafter, I don't know what happened thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Mr Chairman, I see that the time now is one o'clock.  Should we proceed?  It is not much?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>	Right, you were also shot and you were unconscious until you regained your consciousness at the hospital, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> That is how you were arrested, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> That is how I was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Amongst the offences or the acts that you have applied for, you have also included attempted, or escaping from lawful custody.  What made you to want to escape from custody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> It is because I had a visitor from the township, saying that people are getting killed in the township and things are very tense and even my girlfriend doesn't stay at her own home at that moment.  Therefore because of all these things, I decided I have to skip from prison to go and help the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Now, when you were tried and convicted, did you get an opportunity of getting to know the victims, the next of kin of the person that died as a result of the shootout between yourself and the people who came with the vehicle, which you say is a private car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, I saw them in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> If you were to be given an opportunity of approaching the next of kin of the deceased to reconcile with them, would you make use of that opportunity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, I will be happy to get such an opportunity to ask forgiveness from them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> The offence of attempted murder that you have also included, is it related to the shootout between yourselves and the occupants of the private car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Am I correct to say at the time you saw this private car approaching and having met the roadblock, what came to your mind is that these were the police who might have seen you when you made a U-turn, that is running away from the roadblock, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> That is correct.  I thought they saw us when we turned back and therefore I suspected that they were police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Now if you were to be given an opportunity to meet the gentleman whom you robbed the vehicle at Alrode, would you also take that opportunity and try to make peace or reconcile with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, I will appreciate to get such an opportunity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Which Court tried you and what sentence was passed or was given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> I am sorry, it was the Boksburg court and I was sentenced to 33 years for all the charges.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SIBEKO</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will take the lunch adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">THAMI MAHLALA:</span> (still under oath)</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, we are ready to proceed.  I think my learned colleague has closed his evidence, thank you sir.  I don't have any further questions, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you Chair.  Mr Sibeko, if you could just show your client supplement 2.  On page 1 there is a reference to Molefi Michael Selebe.  Is that the same Molefi you refer to in your testimony?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Now, I don't know if you have with your legal representative, gone through the documents attached to Selebe's application, these particular documents in this supplement?  I was just reviewing over the lunch break, the statements in this document, page 9 by one Gehlig and the statement on page 15, by Van Wyk and the other documents essentially relating to what I think is the same application that you are making now.  I am right in that, am I, that you have seen the documents and it is the same set of facts and circumstances essentially as Selebe's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> That is correct so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> It is correct so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> When you go to page 9, the first statement, essentially what this witness says is that there was a burglary, just the long and short of it, there was a burglary and this was followed by a search around the area for the burglars.  They came across this white van and a shootout ensued.  Just very roughly, this is what he says.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>	He mentions a blue Sierra as well, which is what you mention in your evidence.  What is your comment on the statement made by Gehlig on page 9?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> I don't deny the statement.  This is a statement made by Gehlig.  It is his own statements and this is what he said before the Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> The impression I get having read the statements, he is saying that the group you were with, essentially committed this robbery, I beg your pardon, the burglary, housebreaking and theft, and you shot at them without any provocation essentially.  This is what he is saying here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>	Are you saying that these facts are correct, because they are very different to what you told us in your testimony?  Just help me with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> It is not true, we didn't come here to rob the house.  We went to Duduza to collect firearms to defend the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Are you saying that everything that this particular witness says in his statement, is incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, it is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You will agree though that they are talking about the same type of motor vehicle, a blue Sierra, they are talking about Glen Thompson, who you mention in your documents as well, as the person who was killed.  Are you able to give any further explanation as to where this witness is wrong, and where on particular facts, he might be right, because there are certain similarities, but then there are very fundamental differences as well, between this statement and what you are saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>	Just to try and separate the issues for us, so that we can understand them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> With reference to the car, it is correct.  Even if I can't remember the colour, the truth is my statement, it is correct, especially the one that I am just presenting before the Committee.  As I have said that I was coming from Duduza, I don't know whether he was involved in the robbery in his own area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>	I don't know if I have fully explained myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Sorry, you don't know if who was involved in the robbery in his own area, who are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Are you referring to the robbery of the car or...</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> No, I will come to the robbery of the car in a few minutes.  The more material aspects that concern me, in terms of my understanding of your case, concern these two statements by Van Wyk and this other chap, about the facts and circumstances of the shootout, what happened before the shootout, the shootout itself and what happened just after the shootout.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> I am referring to the robbery of the car.  I was with Levi and that happened at Alrode, as I explained before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Can we leave that, the robbery of the car just for a minute and talk about when you were arrested, the shootout and the time that you were arrested in Dawn Park.  That is what these statements refer to.  Are you with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, I understand what is said in these statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And you are saying that what is said in the statements, is a lie, all of it is just a lie?  It is not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You are saying that the people who drove up behind you in the Sierra, shot at you first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And you thought that these people had come from the roadblock that you had avoided earlier on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, I thought they were coming from the roadblock because we were under a light, and I thought they were the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Okay.  Let's come back to your version.  The roadblock was somewhere near Vosloorus.  What was the distance between the point where the roadblock was and the point where you parked under the lamp in Dawn Park, just estimate that distance for us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> It was a big distance, we were very far.  We were out of Vosloorus and because these are two distinct places, Vosloorus and Dawn Park, so we were far from Vosloorus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Now, if I remember well, you were sitting at the back of the bakkie, is this correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Was this an open bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> It was an open bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And at what time of the night was this, there is mention of a light, so I am assuming night time, at what time did this happen roughly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Even if I can't remember the exact time, I will estimate and say it was about twenty five to six or six o'clock.  That is my estimation of the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> While you were sitting at the back of the bakkie, did you notice a car following you from Vosloorus to Dawn Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> But you were sitting with your back to the passengers inside, your back to the cabin, so you were able to observe the cars that were coming behind you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, I was able to see those cars coming towards us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Why is it that you did not notice this car until it had parked behind you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> As I stated that we only noticed the car when it had already parked behind us, and Vusi was outside, he said they were cocking their firearms and I took my firearm.  I didn't see it following us from behind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> But this is my question, if you were sitting in the back of the bakkie, and you had been sitting there all the way from Vosloorus to Dawn Park, why is it that you did not notice this car approach or park?  You only realised that it was there when Vusi mentioned that there was a car, and the guys were cocking their firearms at you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>	It just doesn't sound, I don't quite understand how this could have happened.  Now you are able to explain it to me, because you were there, just help me with this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> I would say there is a steep, the area is steep, so you can only see the car when it is already finished ascending the steep, so you wouldn't be able to see it when it is on the other side of the steep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>	I would say from where I am sitting, to the door, you won't see a car if it is coming from the other side, because of the steep in between.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> I am sorry, you have actually lost me now.  Was the car approaching from the back or the front?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> It was coming from behind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Then just go over what exactly happened after Vusi said that these chaps are cocking their firearms at us.   Let me ask this question, were you armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Vusi and Levi were armed and we also had the guns or the firearms that we went to collect.  Vusi shot back and he fell down.  After he fell down, I took the firearm from him and I started firing towards the private car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> So you were not armed until you took Vusi's firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, I wasn't armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And what firearm was that, Vusi's firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> It was a shotgun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Did Vusi die?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Molefi got out on the other side, and also started shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, that is correct, he was shooting at them with an AK47 and the other man, Jamani, was shooting them with an AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Where did Molefi get his AK47 from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> It was from the firearms that we were supposed to collect from Duduza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And Jamani, also from that batch of firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Jamani was shot at well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Did he manage to escape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes.  He ran to a place which - Levi and Jamani ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Molefi and Jamani ran away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You were the only one who was arrested for this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> When was Molefi arrested for this particular incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> I don't know because I was in jail at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Let me just go back to the robbery, armed robbery, taking the car at Alrode.  You gave us the date of the 29th of October 1992, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, it is correct, but I am not sure, perfectly sure whether it was the 30th or the 29th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> On page 21, if this is the motor vehicle, and I am assuming this is the one, the date they give here is the 28th of August, no, it is not the same vehicle.  We are talking about October in your instance, this isn't the same vehicle?  It is not the same one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> When you escaped from lawful custody, this is the last aspect, did you escape with Molefi or were you on your own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> I was alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Mr Mahlala, I am referring to your application, I see on page 74, you were asked to state the political objective sought to be achieved and you didn't answer that question.  Could you please explain to us what did you intend to achieve by the actions you undertook?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> My main aim was to help the community, because there was intense fighting in the community and there wasn't any other way to protect the community.  The only way was to participate in fighting or defending the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But specifically by shooting at the occupants of the car, what political objective did you intend to achieve?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> As the Commander have already given an instruction that if we are disturbed on our way, we could also be killed, we have to fight to protect these firearms and also to protect our lives.  That is why I had to shoot at them, to protect the community property so that I will be able to take them to the township where they were to be used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>	Unfortunately I wasn't able to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you.  That is the only aspect I wanted to be clarified.  Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mahlala, how long was your trial?  How long did it last?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it a couple of days or did you plead guilty or what is the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> I pleaded not guilty.  I denied that I was guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The people who testified in that trial for the State, did they stick to their versions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Will the speaker please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Those State witnesses who claimed to have witnessed the shooting and that whole incident, did they stick to their versions?  You heard it then and you have been able to read their statements now, did they stick to their versions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, but in some other instances, they contradicted each other.   They were complainants and they were also contradicting each other in court.   They were saying as they were approaching the bakkie, they wanted to see.  I don't know what exactly they wanted to come and see and further, I can't remember some of the other things that they said in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Aside from verbal evidence, was there any other type of evidence which the State chose to lead against you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> I don't remember, but I think there were other things that resulted in the Judge finding me guilty and which specifically refers to the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What about fingerprints in 25 Haslink Street?  Was there any evidence of your fingerprints being in that house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> They didn't mention anything about my fingerprints in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Not even in the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> They didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you in a white bakkie that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you say that you were on your way or you used the bakkie to go and fetch firearms, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, we were using it to go and collect firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Describe this bakkie for me, was it a double cab, do you know what I am talking about, with four doors or only two doors on that bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> It was a two door bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you say you and Vusi were at the back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that, was there a canopy on it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> No, there was no canopy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you sure it was a bakkie, I am going to tell you why I am asking that question, I could hardly think that people who were going to fetch illegal arms, would use an open bakkie to transport arms when they are trying to hide those arms away.  Can you comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, it was a white bakkie, I am sure about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I know that.  But why use an open bakkie when you are trying to conceal things, especially illegal arms?  Why didn't you people rob another person of a car, where you could put the firearms in the boot and nobody would suspect or see anything?  Or at least you wouldn't risk anybody seeing the arms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> We didn't select any particular car.  It so happened that the bakkie came, and we took it, because it was a Contractor's car.  Even if a private car came, we would have robbed it.  Whether it was a private car or a bakkie, it was not ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You knew why this motor vehicle needed to be stolen, not so, or hijacked?  You were aware of the purpose for it, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, I knew that we were robbing it in order to use it to carry firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there any particular reason why you never suggested leave this bakkie, because we are going to have to put the firearms on the back of the bakkie, there is more chance of being found out?  Let us steal or hijack a closed motor vehicle, so that we can hide these firearms when we are transporting it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> As I think I have already mentioned, that the firearms were not carried in the back of the car, but they were in front where Jamani and Levi were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That may be so, but at that time when you stole the motor vehicle, I am asking did it not cross your mind to take further precautions at the risk of being detected?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> It didn't come to our minds.   What came to our minds is to get a car and with that car, we will be able to get the firearms from Duduza back to the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, you say Vusi got off the motor vehicle when it was parked under a light, to go urinate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, he was passing water by the side of the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you, as I understand your evidence, this other motor vehicle with these white people, suddenly came and parked behind you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, although I wasn't sure whether they were white or black people inside at the time, they did come and park behind us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Suddenly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, it happened very quickly, while we were thinking what to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you not see this motor vehicle coming on to you from a distance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> No, I personally did not see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why not, did anything prevent you from seeing it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> It is because where we parked our bakkie, it was on the low area and there is a steep before you reach it, so if you are coming from the other side of the steep, I can only see you when you are close to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>	I couldn't see further.  I am trying to describe the road, how it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did anybody use the hooter of that bakkie at that time, immediately before the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> No, I didn't hear the sound.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it possible someone did use the hooter of the bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> No.  I didn't hear the bakkie's hooter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am given to understand in the trail, it was alleged that the house in Haslink Street was burgled, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> I don't know because I didn't go there to rob such a house, I went to collect the firearms, so I don't know about it, it is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you hear that in the trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, I did hear about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know, I am not saying you were guilty of it, do you know whether that house was in fact burgled?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Also in your trial it was said that certain appliances, amongst which was a television, was found in the veld in close proximity to where you people were parked that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> In court, they didn't discuss anything about TV and they didn't mention anything which was found in our vicinity.  The only thing that were found or discovered, were firearms where we were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you say your fingerprints were found inside the bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> No, it wasn't mentioned to me in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am sorry, I thought you said that your fingerprints were found inside the motor vehicle.  Did you not say so?  I am sorry if you didn't say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>	Did you mention anything about fingerprints?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you don't know how many firearms were found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You got ten years for murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Will the speaker please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you get ten years for murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And for the attempted murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> They mentioned ten years consecutively, so I can't remember, but I ended up with 33.  They also mentioned three years in one of the charges.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That was for the unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition, I suppose.  You got ten years each for murder, attempted murder, armed robbery and that ran separately?  Is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, they combined everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> According to your record, you will serve an effective 20 years imprisonment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLALA:</span> Yes, I am serving a 20 year sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, you are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Mr Chairman, this was the only application I had for today.  May I be excused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you mean for today, have you got more tomorrow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> I still have to go through the list that is here with Mrs Nhlayisi to see whether there are still outstanding applications which are hearable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibeko, why was this not done over the weekend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Mr Chairman, we prepared this report which was given over to Mr Steenkamp sometime last week, and then there were applicants that were not consulted as yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>	We tried to secure some over the weekend, and I left Mrs Nhlayisi to consult with them.  I am not sure as yet whether those are hearable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When are we going to hear about whether there are further applications?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Just before we adjourn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can't I adjourn now and then you can sort it out, if necessary we can continue with the hearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> (indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please, we will adjourn.</p>

<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Steenkamp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I don't know if it is the proper time to do so, but we do have the Attorney appearing for the Khanyile family here today, Mr Shane is here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>	As I understand, we are going to deal with the matter of Mr Buthelezi, who is also an applicant in the killing, the murder of Mr Khanyile.  There is a request from the Attorney, if I may do so Mr Chairman, with all due respect, to place herself on record, and just to inform you officially what the position regarding the family is and regarding certain documents that were handed in.  If that may be done within a jiffy, thank you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MS BOSSARD:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, as previously stated I appear on behalf of the Khanyile family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you just announce your name for the purposes of the record please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MS BOSSARD:</span> My name is Tracey Bossard, I will be appearing on behalf of the Khanyile family, namely Sothole Khanyile, Msizwe Khanyile and also on behalf of the aunt, Margaret Mabuza.  We would just like to place on record, that they are all present today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>	Mr Chairman, we further wish to place on record that we have handed in the affidavits on behalf of the victims.  They have also been handed to my colleague, he is well aware of the contents, he has had an opportunity to peruse them.  We have however, not any idea what his position is on these documents at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can we mark that bundle, Exhibit 6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> As you wish Mr Chairman, that is correct Mr Chairman, it must be Exhibit 6.  Mr Chairman, I do apologise, unfortunately I am sitting here with the original.  I do apologise profusely, I would like permission just to hand in the originals if I may do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I do have an original.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Apparently sir, they are all signed.  Thank you, I am sorry sir, thank you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Anything else Ms Bossard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MS BOSSARD:</span> No thank you Mr Chairman, it is fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You indicated that you had not had any response from who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MS BOSSARD:</span> From my colleague, Mr Shane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think he may be in a better position at the end of the day, to tell you what he wants to do.  Mr Shane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I have read the affidavits and discussed it with the applicants.  In fact the only applicant I could discuss it with today was (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>	He is adamant that he had information that can prove that the late Bheki was in fact a member of the IFP and was in fact ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Shane, I am going to stop you right there.  This is not the time to discuss the merits and the contents of this affidavit.  All I wanted to know was whether you have any procedural objection to the handing in at the moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Sorry sir, I misunderstood you.  No objection to handing in the affidavit, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can we proceed with what you want to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> My position Mr Chairman, we don't object, as I said we don't object to the affidavits, my position is that the two applicants will deny what is contained in the affidavit of Margaret Mtombiyotwa Mabuza, paragraph 4 and they deny that they had anything to do with registration, car registration documents, these are denied, and my instructions ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Shane, I thought I just made myself quite clear.  Last time, I looked in the dictionary, merits means exactly what you are discussing now.  We don't want to discuss the merits of these affidavits as yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>	Just forget about Ms Bossard's request, I have dealt with that.  I understand that you have certain applications to make.  Let's get on with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Sir, I would like the Committee to reconsider the application made last week, in respect of Mzwake Buthelezi, who is not, whose application has been lost.  This is the application dealt with on Thursday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>	I submit it is relevant to the opposition to amnesty by the Khanyile family.  I am ready to proceed, I have supplementary affidavits and copies.  My client was present a few minutes earlier on, he is there, I would like to call him up, please Mr chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Shane, before we proceed any further, let me get this clear.  There is a person, a South African citizen, who alleges that he made an application for amnesty for whatever reason, to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, namely the Amnesty Committee, do I understand it correctly so far?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> He made an application before or on the deadline day for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That matter has not been set down, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It would see, I am informed, the reason for that matter or that alleged application, not being enrolled, is because such an application is either never arrived at the offices of the TRC or that it is not to be found.  Am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Sir, he says the application did not get to the TRC offices, correct, it was made on the 10th of May and it got lost from the time he signed his application, completed the form.  It got lost.  It could have got lost after it was handed to the TRC office at that time, at that time they were in the Sanlam Building, it could have been lost after it was given to them, or it could have been lost between the time it was signed by him and brought to the TRC offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now last week, when you made a similar attempt to get this application on the role, I pointed it out to you that I was going to give you the time, and your client the time, until today, to do the necessary in order to satisfy this Committee that in fact, the document is not before this Committee through the fault of the TRC, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>	Are you able to satisfy us on that score?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I hope to Mr Chairman.  I don't know if affidavits have been, further affidavits have been placed before you.  I have a supplementary affidavit Mr Chairman, of the applicant.  That is a short affidavit, just giving further details, and I have an affidavit of Sally Sealy before you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>	There is another affidavit, it is just a confirming affidavit by George Ndlozi. Unfortunately, he is - I don't want to give you an unsigned document sir, he is not available to sign that affidavit.  It is just a very short affidavit, basically confirming what Sally Sealy has said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And now, what must I do with this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> The affidavit of Sally Sealy and the applicant, supplementary affidavit of the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman, I submit that on what you've got before you, it seems quite clear that Mzwake Buthelezi did on the 10th of May 1997, make application for amnesty together with very many other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>	I submit sir, that on the papers before you, it is quite obvious that what happened to his application, cannot be attributed to any fault on his part.  Mr Chairman, with the greatest ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can it be attributed to any fault of the TRC, that is the issue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I submit Mr Chairman, from this he doesn't know, it got lost somewhere on the way.  Mr Chairman, if you look at your mandate, your function here I submit with respect, is clear, your function is the promotion of national unity and reconciliation, and Mr Chairman, I submit there is nothing to suggest that anything underhand has gone on here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a>	The applicant as he says in his affidavit, became worried about this, when he didn't get a notice to attend the TRC hearings.  He never ever before, he never checked if he got an acknowledgement, he didn't know about the acknowledgements.  I submit that is not important Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>	The fact is this, as the affidavit of Sally Sealy suggests, this is not the only application form that has gone missing, it could be human error.  I submit it is no error on the part of the applicant, because he did make his application.  He cannot say what happened to his application form. </p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>	Then it is also backed up by the fact that under oath, you heard from his co-applicant, I think it was Mutshatsha, who testified under oath that the applicant, Mzwake Mbuli was also there that day with him, when they filled in their forms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>	Mr Chairman, I submit that your mandate says that you have to lean over backwards in favour of let's call him the applicant, although there are no papers before you, and I submit that on what you've got before you Mr Chairman, it is sufficient to allow the applicant to have an opportunity to satisfy you that he is entitled to apply for amnesty and get amnesty in terms of the Act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>	Mr Chairman, I submit there is nothing more that this applicant or the proposed applicant, because he is not really an applicant before you,  but I submit that it is quite clear from what you've got before you, that he was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>	I also ask you Mr Commissioner, to take into account what probably on the 10th of May 1997, what was for all involved, a major chaotic day, stressful, hectic, it is a day when things could have gone wrong.  This could have possibly fallen in the car, anything could have happened to it, but this application form did not get to the TRC, that is what we know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> It did not get to the TRC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Sorry, it did not get to be processed by the TRC, I should rather put it.  It might have got to the TRC offices as I said, and something happened to it thereafter, or before it got to the TRC offices, something might have happened to it, but from the applicant's point of view,he went on the last day to make application for amnesty and something went wrong with his application form and it vanished.  That is all he can say Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>	I submit that before you, you can be satisfied that he was there and he did apply with all his comrades for amnesty.  That is clearly before you Mr Chairman, and I submit in the absence of anything to suggest otherwise, you must accept that with the greatest respect sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you done?  Mr Shane, there is a few things I need you to clear up in making this application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>	You are in fact making an application to get this on the role?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is common cause that it is not on the role?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have made certain submissions which include amongst others, that there is ample evidence to indicate that your client had in fact completed a form with the assistance of one Sally Sealy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> She says as I understand, that there were a number of applications that day that were put into a box and subsequently handed in to an employee of the TRC in Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have gone further and says well, look, we accept that it is missing now, it could have got lost en route to the TRC offices, it could have got lost at the Johannesburg offices, it could have got lost en route from the TRC offices Johannesburg, to TRC offices in Cape Town, and that is why it wasn't processed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Correct Mr Chairman, I say that in so far as I was explained the procedure of these applications.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  What would be the case or the position, if it was lost assuming I accept that the application form was completed, and intended to land up in Cape Town for process, what would be the case if it did not land at the TRC offices, Johannesburg and got lost in the motor vehicle or somewhere before then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman, let us assume then that for example the box, a big box, the box with all the applications were being carried to a car, Mr Buthelezi's application was right on top and the wind blew it away and it went missing before it got in the car, that is a similar scenario to what you have suggested, in that case Mr Chairman, I would submit that if the applicant was present, and you are satisfied that he was present and he filled in his form, then I would submit that you would give the applicant the opportunity to bring his application in circumstances like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, that would be an exception to the rule.  Do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> To what rule Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That by the 10th of May 1997 at, call it 12 o'clock in the morning, I think ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Yes, midnight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, such applications had to be submitted and not later.  Do we at least agree on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman, yes, that is what the Act says must be submitted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Am I empowered to go beyond that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I submit with the greatest respect sir, you are empowered to go beyond that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Show me the empowering clause.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman, I can't show you an empowering clause, but if the purpose of your function is the promotion of national unity and reconciliation, Mr Chairman, there are no rules, there is no precedence, there is no court rules to go on, this is not a court of law, I submit by the very nature of the legislation, promotion of national unity and reconciliation, it would mean that your application of the rules should not in any way be restricted and I would submit Mr Chairman, that only if there were for instance, if there was evidence before you that the applicant was not there, that he was lying or that he came the following day, too late, that is a different issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>	I submit Mr Chairman, with the evidence of Sally Sealy, with the evidence of the previous applicant that Buthelezi was present, I submit that you cannot view it in a restrictive way with the greatest respect sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the test Mr Shane?  Isn't the test to check and to see whether the application form completed, had reached the offices, it doesn't matter whether it was Johannesburg or Durban or Cape Town or East London, wherever, as long as it was in the hands of the Commission by twelve o'clock that day, is that not the test?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman, I would say not, because if I may ask you this question, Mr Chairman, what would have happened for example if after having loaded the box in his vehicle, the TRC official on his way back to Johannesburg, say at half past eleven in the evening, got hijacked, which was a common thing then, and the whole box ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, it would have been in the hands of the TRC, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> It would have been in the hands of the TRC and there would have been no applications brought to the TRC, with respect Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then we would have handled it on that basis as accepting that the time restraints on applications, had been complied with, by twelve o'clock that morning, those applications should have been where it was supposed to be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Well, I submit Mr Chairman, because this application was handed to Mr George Ndlozi, a TRC official ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who said so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Sally Sealy says so, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did she say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I refer you to paragraph 6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Read it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I handed the box to Mr George Ndlozi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> She handed a box, Mr Shane.  How do we know that that box contained that application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman, if that is viewing it restrictively, I refer you to paragraph 5.  In paragraph 5, Sally Sealy says I am surprised that this application form is missing as I took this form to the TRC offices at the Sanlam Centre, Johannesburg, at quarter to twelve on the 10th of May, along with many others, in a photocopy paper box.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am sure she did it, yes.  How do we know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman, if you are looking at it restrictively and if you are, there is someone who says this is not true, that is a different story, but Mr Chairman, there is nothing, I submit that it is quite clear that this is the same box she was talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>	This was put in a box, she brought the box to, she gave the box to Ndlozi, a TRC official and in that box, was Mzwake Buthelezi's application form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does she say so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Well, she put it in the box.  Mr Chairman, I mean if necessary, Sally Sealy is outside, I can if you like, I could call her.  She was outside a few minutes ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Shane, Mr Shane, you are not going to treat this hearing like an informal hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> No, no sir, I ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now listen to me.  We were talking about the scenario that you pictured, pen pictured here about the flying away with the ill-wind of this application form on the top of the box.  What would be the position of the applicant then, that is where we were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right, if his form when it was being loaded in the car or something, got lost, blown away or whatever, I would submit Mr Chairman, with the greatest respect, it was given to an official of the TRC and it was given before the deadline on the 27th of May.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If it was blown away, then it wasn't given to the TRC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> No, no sir, I am saying if it was given, the box was given, it was put in a box, it was given to Mr George Ndlozi, it was in the box.  George Ndlozi, being a TRC official, I submit that is sufficient.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are we able to say that that application form completed, that application form that we are talking about, was in fact in the box at the time that box was handed over to the TRC official?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I submit yes, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How can you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Well sir, you know, at the time with respect, Sally Sealy was present, she was dealing with not one, numerous applications.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a>	That is the procedure she adopted.  No one can expect them to know about each individual piece of paper that they got.  There were many, and the applicant, well Mzwake Buthelezi's was there, together with numerous others.  His happens to be missing, like some others got missing.  It is human error, it could have been on the part of Ndlozi, I submit that Ndlozi did receive it with the others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why does it have to be the fault of the TRC?  Why is it only, the possibility only in respect of the TRC officials?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Oh no, Mr Chairman, one cannot exclusively put the blame on the TRC, you cannot exclusively put the blame on the TRC, it is also possible, the possibility exists, but remember Mr Chairman, it is only a possibility, the possibility exists that maybe this form, maybe it dropped out of Sally Sealy's hands before she got to Mr Ndlozi.  That is a possibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a>	One will never know Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Precisely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> But because Mr Chairman, and I mean Sally Sealy can't say that that is impossible that that happened.  Do you have to look at it because that might have happened, what you've got before you, is not sufficient to have this application heard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Show me this clause that empowers me to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman, with respect, my submission with respect, the greatest respect is that you have power to do anything that is in the interest of the promotion of national unity and reconciliation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>	There is no clause.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where do you see that, where do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Well Mr Chairman, that is the purpose of the Commission, to promote, I cannot give you the law, there is no Act that empowers you to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now let me tell you something.  I am going to adjourn after I make these comments and I want you to go and consider it at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>	Section 19 says the Committee shall consider applications for amnesty, not amnesty for enrolment, applications for amnesty, that is Section 19(1).</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>	Subsection (2), the Committee shall investigate the application and make such enquiries as it may deem necessary.  Subsection (3), after the investigation, the Committee may inform the applicant of the application, etc, afford the applicant an opportunity to make further submissions, decide whether the application, judged on its particulars referred to above, relates to an act associated with a political objective.  And so it goes on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> And it only deals with applicants Mr Chairman, we don't have an applicant before you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And it only deals with applications, and neither do I have an application before me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> That is my problem Mr Chairman, and that is why I have ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At least we have progressed, it is your problem, not mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Well, it is my client's problem Mr Chairman, he wanted, he is concerned about it and he wants his application for amnesty to be heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You know Mr Shane, on Thursday when we adjourned, we wasted a day on Friday, we didn't sit, okay.  We all agreed, including you that today would be the day you would consider your position and then finalise this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You come with additional affidavits that don't help us at all.  You still haven't satisfied me, these affidavits haven't satisfied me one bit, that this application form completed was in the hands of the TRC, either by way of agency or otherwise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>	That was the test.  Now you come and ask me to overlook that and listen to the application.  If I must make a decision like that, it carries a lot of ramifications and implications.  I am not empowered to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I understand that Mr Chairman, I am not asking you to overlook it, I am asking you to find that on the papers before you, on a balance of probabilities, obviously it can never be beyond reasonable doubt, but I am asking you to find that on the papers before you Mr Chairman, that on a balance of probabilities, his application was with the TRC, was handed to an official of the TRC.  The rest as to what could have happened to it, is pure speculation.  I will concede there is a possibility, there is a possibility that maybe his application didn't get to the hands or into the control of a TRC official, there is that possibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>	On a balance of probabilities, what you've got before you, you can find that his application was handed in timeously to the TRC or to a TRC official, on a balance of probabilities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is not that easy Mr Shane, because you argue from one point of view that because it was not processed, and because he attended this gathering where applications were made, the other applicants' applications were processed, therefore I can safely draw the conclusion that your client, or the applicant in this case, his application must have landed in the hands of the TRC.  That is fine, that is one view.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>	The other view also is that because all the others were processed, why wasn't yours or your client's, if it was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman, that the TRC is run by human beings, and human error creeps into everything.  It could be human error.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I dare say that your client was also assisted by human beings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Yes, with the greatest respect Mr Chairman, he was assisted by human beings, and when I consulted with him, he is adamant that his form went in and he wants to make application for amnesty because he killed people.  He also wants to go through this healing process or whatever one may call it, on a balance of probabilities, not beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>	On a balance of probabilities, you can find that his application was in timeously to the TRC, to an official of the TRC, on time, and something then went wrong.  That I submit, it is possible that something could, but on a balance of probabilities, and that is all you need sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>	I submit you don't need anything before you beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am not suggesting that.  I must be satisfied, I am not even talking about a balance of probabilities.  All I am saying is satisfy us.  It is slightly easier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>	Another issue I want to raise with you, you know that our attention has been drawn to what the deponement of one of your affidavits said in a criminal trial, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, what is the position about that?   Can we rely on this affidavit, given that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Absolutely sir, with respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On the one hand she says the this matter is not a political matter and then she goes about assisting people, making allegations that it was done for political reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman, I submit with the greatest respect that that whole passage was taken totally out of context, and I would ask you Mr Chairman, if you were to read, because I did discuss it with that person, and it appears that it was taken out of context, if the whole evidence that she gave and it relates to evidence that she gave in mitigation of sentence, she said usually, generally the killing of policemen is not a political offence, generally but it goes further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>	I must be honest sir, I haven't read the whole report, but I have discussed it with her and my instructions are that it was taken out of context.  Then in answer to your question, I submit that you can accept the affidavit of that person, in the application to hear Mzwake Mbuli, I mean Buthelezi, sorry sir, Mzwake Buthelezi, I apologise for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you agree that you are in no position to allege, or you provided no evidence at all, to say or to indicate that that application was in the hands of the TRC timeously, you are asking us to draw inferences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I am asking you to draw an inference, and I have also, as I have indicated sir, the affidavit, I do have another confirmatory affidavit of the person known as George Ndlozi, the TRC official.  Unfortunately George Ndlozi was not available to sign the affidavit, although I did have a lengthy consultation with him, he had to run off before he could sign it.  That wouldn't take you much further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We are going to take overnight to consider this matter, and we will give a decision on it tomorrow morning.  We will adjourn until tomorrow, nine o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
