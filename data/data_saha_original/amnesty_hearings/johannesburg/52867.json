But if my friend is of that view, he wants to cater, we don't have problem.  I can lead him through the affidavit for the benefit of the members of the family definitely.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I'll then go through the affidavit, Mr Chairman\n\"I, the undersigned, Shakespeare Thami Buthelezi, do hereby make an oath and say that I'm the applicant herein.  The facts to which I depose are true and correct and within my personal knowledge unless the context states otherwise.  I was born on the 18th December 1970 in Katlehong, Germiston, and unmarried and have one child who is staying with my family.  I have three brothers and sisters, and my father died in 1977 and my mother became a breadwinner at home.  I left school doing standard eight in 1987 because of financial problems.  I joined the PAC through Azania in 1984 and my sole aim was to fight against the colonial education and settler regime.  In July 1988 I left the country via Swaziland to Tanzania where I undergone military training for a year.  In 1989 I went to Uganda to be trained in infantry and it took me a year.  After my training in Uganda I went back to Bagamoiyo(?), Tanzania where I became a platoon commissar.  In January 1993 I was given orders to infiltrate the country by the APLA commander, Sabelo Pama.  As an APLA operative my general instruction from APLA high command was to proceed with the armed struggle with all means against the then racist minority regime, which was undemocratic and oppressive.  The said armed struggle was in essence a guerilla warfare during which we as APLA cadres had to seek and attack the bastions and minions of the then aforesaid regime.  The ultimate objective of PAC and APLA was not only to topple the then racist regime, but to eventually return the land to the African people.  The bastions and minions of the then erstwhile regime was in terms of PAC and APLA perspective, the members of South African Defence Force, the members of SAP and reservist in general, the farmers, as they belonged to commander structures over and above the fact they occupied the farms which we had to drive them away from, so as to widen our territorial base which was aimed at eventually consolidated, liberated and repossessed land.  The informers, the white homes which were garrison of apartheid.  My general instruction was to seek, identify and attack the enemy, who was seen in the context of the above stated bastions and minions of the regime, and also to train the cadres and command them in whatever operation that is being embarked upon in consequence of and in pursuit of the above stated objectives.  During or about the 21st January 1993 I commanded a unit of APLA cadres that attacked a policeman near Katlehong Police Station.  I monitored the activities of the Katlehong Police Station and also the activities of the police around Katlehong area.  On the 21st January 1993, myself, Eugene Madikane and Gift Mosiya, we were next to the Katlehong Police Station to monitor our target, who were the police working in the police station.  We saw one policeman going to the direction of Monaheng Section.  We followed him.  I decided to rush and pass him so that I confront him directly and Eugene Madikane and Gift Mosiya were to come from behind.  I drew my Tokaroff pistol and stopped him by pointing with the firearm, and he tried to drew his pistol and I shot him, and we took away his firearm, 9mm pistol.  I subsequently learnt that the policeman died and it was Sergeant Mashamahite.  After two weeks the police were looking for us.  They went to all our places and they could not get us.  And we were told by Vusi, an APLA cadre, that they are being accompanied by Basie Hladi whenever they are looking for us and he is staying in Twala Section.  On the 15th of March 1993 Gift saw the informer at Twala Section and he called me and I gave him Tokaroff pistol.  I took the 9mm pistol we repossessed from the policeman and went to his place.  He was busy drinking when we arrived and he tried to run away.  I drew my gun and when I was about to shoot him a person who knew us came and we abandoned the mission and we waited near his place and we saw him coming out of his home.  I shot him, but I missed and he ran away.  This informer came back accompanied by police and they approached us, but Gift managed to escape and I was left alone.  I shot at the police and they shot back and struck me on my right leg, and I ran out of bullets and I was arrested.  The charges against me were withdrawn twice because of lack of evidence.  And on the 10th November 1994 I was finally re-arrested at Die Brug assembly point in Bloemfontein and at the time I was a member of the South African National Defence Force, having integrated on the 13th August 1994.  I am presently serving 64 years having been found guilty on several charges, including murder, two counts of robbery, attempted murder and possession of arms and ammunition, for which I was sentenced at the High Court of South Africa, Witwatersrand Division under case number 103/95, on the 3rd November 1995.  I respectfully submit that my application complies with the requirements of the Act, and that I have made full and proper disclosure of my involvement in the Katlehong operation.  I therefore humbly request that my application for amnesty be granted.\"\n\tMr Chairman, as I indicated, I have read the affidavit for the benefit of them all.  I will go to that paragraph which I wanted to start with.  \n\tMr Buthelezi, as I indicated that paragraph 11, you told that you went to the house of the alleged informer and when you were about to shoot him somebody who knew you came and you abandoned the mission.  Without reading the whole paragraph, Mr Buthelezi, in your trial it transpired that, and evidence came out and you were also convicted that you robbed this person of his money and you do not mention that in your affidavit.

As we were fighting the then regime in a peaceful manner.  \n\tThe reactionary forces who were the police shot and killed unarmed Africans who did not have even an axe.  Therefore we decided that we will no longer talk peace.  This led to the PAC trying by any means to establish military wings because there was no other way.  There was no way we could be talking about peace when reactionary forces were killing our members.  Therefore my killing of Mashamahite was not meant at hurting his family.

            "Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I will start by saying that Section 20(1) of the Act, that is the Amnesty Act, Mr Chairman, provides as follows\n\"If the Committee, after considering an application for amnesty is satisfied that the application complies with the requirements of the Act, the act, omission or offence to which the application relates is an act associated with political objectives committed in the course of the conflicts of the past in accordance with provisions of Subsection 2 and 3 and the applicant has made full disclosure of all relevant facts, it shall grant amnesty in respect of that act, omission or offence.\"\nYour Worship, further just before I argue, I want to quote Section 20(2) provides:\n\"In this Act, unless the contents indicates otherwise, acts associated with political objectives means any act or omission which constitutes an offence or delict which, according to the criteria in Subsection 3 is associated with political objective and which was advised, planned, directed, commanded, ordered, or committed within or outside the Republic during the period of 1st March 1960 to the cut-off date by any member or supporter of a publicly known organisation or liberation movement on behalf of or in support of such organisation in furtherance of political struggle waged by such organisation against the State.  Any member of a publicly known political in the course and scope of his duties and within the scope of his express or implied authority.  Any person referred in paragraph (d) who, on reasonable grounds believed that he was acting in the course and scope of his duties and within the scope of his express or implied authority.\"\n\tMr Chairman, I submit on behalf of the applicant, that he has complied with the requirements of Section 20(2).  That he was quite acting clearly on behalf of APLA, a publicly known political organisation and liberation movement which was engaged in political struggle against the State at that time.\n\tMr Chairman, I also submit that the applicant did not act for personal gain or out of personal malice or ill-will or spite directed against the deceased and the victim.  It is quite clear that he had no personal knowledge of these people and that he had merely acted on behalf of his organisation.  \n\tMr Chairman, you have heard the testimony of the applicant.  That APLA set, and PAC, certain parameters and he acted within those parameters.  That the main targets and the targets were the South African Defence Force, SA Police, reservist in general, the farmers, the informers and the white homes, who were regarded as garrison of apartheid and, Mr Chairman, that is not in dispute that he was also there, he had instruction as a cadre, he has to seek, identify and attack the enemy within that context of those parameters which have been set.\n\tMr Chairman, I take you now back to the fateful incident on the unfortunate day of January 1993.  On the 21st January 1993 when the applicant attacked the late Mashamahite.  Mr Chairman, it's not in dispute that Mr Mashamahite was a policeman and it so happened that on the day in question he was coming from the police station and he was easily identified because he was wearing uniform.  So there was not even a dispute about his identity that he was a policeman and the applicant acted according to the parameters of his organisation and he killed Mashamahite and repossessed his firearm.\n\tMr Chairman, I know that in court it transpired that from the eyewitness that they alleged that they first grabbed him and they held him before he was shot.  Mr Chairman, I wouldn't like to argue that point.  I was not there.  The witness saw what they saw on the day in question, but the point is if the applicant is lying why would he admit that he killed Mashamahite?  There's no doubt about that one.  He made it clear that he killed Mashamahite.  He does not say another person killed Mashamahite or his colleague pulled the trigger.  He said, \"I pulled the trigger\".  Even if, Mr Chairman, they started by holding him and they shot him thereafter, they would be acting within the scope because Mashamahite was regarded by APLA and PAC as working within the system and they were protecting the system as a policeman.  \n\tAnd as such, Mr Chairman, I wouldn't see any reason why the applicant would deny that he was shot in the circumstances described by the witnesses in court.  And as such, Mr Chairman, I request this Committee to find that on that aspect the applicant has made full disclosure as to regard to the killing and the robbery of Mr Mashamahite.  And that they acted within his course and scope of his being the member of APLA and furthering the aims of a publicly known political organisation.\n\tMr Chairman, I proceed to the attempted murder and robbery of Hladi.  Mr Chairman, it's clear from what the applicant has told the Committee, that he perceived Hladi as an informer and that Hladi went around with the police trying to locate them after the killing of the policeman, and it was the reason that they decided to eliminate him because he was going to cause them to be arrested of that incident, and he believed that he would later give evidence in court and if he kills him there will be no evidence against him.  \n\tAt that particular point in time though, Mr Chairman, it transpired that Hladi did not give evidence in court, but at the time he perceived and he believed that Hladi was the main person who made the police to know that they were the main people who killed Mashamahite and at that time he bona fide believed that he was an informer of the policeman and he has to be eliminated.  And also, Mr Chairman, it transpired that one APLA cadre Vusi told him and that Hladi is an informer.  It was during the drinks that he mentioned that though he did not know Vusi at that time, that he's a member of APLA, that he will pocket 50 grand if Shakes can be arrested.\n\tI think that, Mr Chairman, if the Committee accepts that, that that indeed was said by Vusi to the applicant and was said by Hladi, it will fit like a glove to the evidence of the applicant that Hladi was moving around trying to assist the police in arresting them, that he was an informer.  And as such, Mr Chairman, I want the Committee to believe and accept the version of the applicant, that by attempting to kill Hladi he acted bona fide and he believed him to be an informer, and he was acting within the course and scope of his organisation and trying to protect the members of his unit and himself being arrested so that they can be able to continue with the armed struggle.\n\tMr Chairman, I want the Committee also to take into account that at that time, though everybody knew that the negotiations were in place, that PAC and APLA have not yet suspended the armed struggle, and also in the community it was not yet over where most of the time, I want to concede, most of the time people were killed just because somebody said he's an informer, and most of those instances you'll find that if you can go deep, you'll find that some of them were innocent.  But because of the political situation at the time everybody was sceptical even if he sees you talking to a policeman they wouldn't understand why you are talking to a policeman.  And as such, Mr Chairman, those incidents happen because of that.",

The armed struggle, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, Mr Mbandazayo, terminated on the 16th of December 1993 on behalf of APLA and it did take some time before that message filtered to all the units on the ground.  There was a congress at UNITRA at that time when the armed struggle was finally terminated.",

            "Mr Chairman, that's a correction, it was in January where the armed struggle was officially suspended.  The congress in UNITRA took a decision that the leadership should suspend the armed struggle when it is appropriate.  The authority lies with the congress and the congress shifted it to the leadership when its appropriate time suspend the armed struggle.  That decision was taken at UNITRA and the armed struggle was suspended in January officially, 1994, Mr Chairman.\n\tMr Chairman, if I may continue on this aspect.  And now, Mr Chairman, as I indicated that not everybody was comfortable with the situation of the negotiation and people were sceptical about the negotiation and in particular the organisation to which the applicant belongs was still engaged in the armed struggle and at that particular point in time when he committed this offence.  And to make it, Mr Chairman, to the sceptics in order to - the sceptics were vindicated when the PAC officers and the APLA cadres over the country were arrested during the negotiations.  And that PAC said, \"We said that we need to go to neutral venue, the regime cannot be referee and the chairman, because they still have the arms and it is said that we must suspend the armed struggle\".  And the police unfortunately were the people who had to do that job on behalf of the politicians and they were always on the first line, firing line.\n\tNow, Mr Chairman, I don't want to lose track, I want to tie it with the question of robbery, this instance because it is alleged that he was robbed R100,00.  The applicant has vehemently denied, I know that in terms of the Act, if you have to come and tell the Committee what you have done, but when it comes to him he still stand by his position that when it comes to this aspect in the whole incident of Hladi, there was no robbery.  I must confess, Mr Chairman, I have talked to my client, I've tried and he told me that, \"If I tell the Committee other story just because I want to be granted amnesty I will not be honest to the Committee\".  We would have done every means to make it sound political, even there, the robbery of Hladi but he did not want to budge because he said, \"Look, it means I'm not honest.  I'm doing it for the sake that I want amnesty\".\n\tAnd, Mr Chairman, I think that the Committee can take that in his favour because he had no way of misleading the Committee and say, \"No, I did that.  I committed it.  We wanted this because we were going to sell it and raise funds for the party.  We didn't have funds\".  But he decided to be honest and open to the Committee and say, \"This one, I want to stand my ground even if the Committee decides whatever it decides\".  Even if it means that he's not granted amnesty.  And I told him the implication and he said, \"Look, if that it means that then let it be instead of saying go and mislead them and say I've done something which I have not done\".  He said, \"I have the opportunity now to say I've done it.  I can defend and say in court it was because I wanted to get away with the offence\".  But he said, \"Look, I'm still maintaining my ground.  If the Committee does not want to give me amnesty, he can refuse amnesty but I cannot say I've done something which I have not done\".  And that, Mr Chairman, in itself, I think if the Committee can take the whole incident in totality, I think that it can count in his favour.\n\tMr Chairman, having made those submissions, I don't want to bore you, maybe you still have questions.  I want to say that in conclusion, that the applicant has established that he belongs to a political organisation, a known one, publicly known one and he acted within the scope and course of that organisation and that what he did was not for personal gain but everything he did was in furtherance of the aims and objective of the organisation in which he was and as such, Mr Chairman, I humbly request and submit to this Committee that the applicant has made full and proper disclosure to this Committee regarding his role in the incident of the late Mashamahite and Hladi murder.  And I request that the Committee grant him amnesty accordingly.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Unless the Committee wants to ask question.",

            "Yes, thank you, thank you very much.  It really just leaves the question of the robbery count that the applicant was convicted on and was given a fairly heavy sentence of eight (8) years for a robbery of what is given as R380,00 on the papers before us, and the applicant has indicated to us that he had a clean record.  I haven't looked at the judgment on sentence in any great detail, but I approach the matter on that basis.  I think you have already made the submission quite correctly that of course if there is not a confirmation that was in fact part of the incident in question, then technically speaking it leaves that particular count out of the issues that we would be able to have a look at.  Is that how you submit the matter stands at this stage in view of the situation that has developed around this robbery count?",

Mr Chairman, when you were talking I was just thinking about a case, a similar case which I handled, which was similar to this one in 1995 in East London, where the Committee comprised of Judge Small and Judge Wilson and Miss Khampepe.\n\tI happened to face a similar situation where an applicant was convicted of kidnapping and it was a chairman of AZAPO, Eastern Cape.  It can be easily got in the Amnesty Committee, and I think it was the feeling of the Committee that it was too much, taking into account the whole circumstances and the circumstances under which the incident happened that they ended up granting even amnesty on that aspect.  That's why I was saying look, I was trying to prove the bona fides that the Committee maybe it can use its discretion if he has on this matter, but I had a similar case where he was convicted of kidnapping and to be honest Judge Wilson was not pleased inasmuch as the evidence was there before the court that they took away these people, but he felt that it was too severe.  And this guy was sentenced in fact to twenty (20) years' imprisonment.  He was sentenced to twenty (20) years' imprisonment and they granted him.  I just forgotten the name, Mr Chairman, of the applicant, but it can be easily be got in the Amnesty Committee.  That's why I'm saying, Mr Chairman, I've done everything for the applicant, but he wanted to be open and honest with the Committee.  That the Committee may use its discretion when it comes to that.",

But assuming your submission is accepted, that your client has qualified and has satisfied Sections 21 and 22 and that takes care of the other counts leaving this particular one with a very insignificant amount in issue.  Unfortunately Mr Hladi isn't here.  We have taken steps to raise him.  \tApplicant has indicated to us that Mr Hladi wanted to speak to him so it doesn't appear as if there is any particular bad blood between them at this stage.  Speaking for myself, it does leave one with a feeling of unease, if you have to approach the matter on the basis that that particular count doesn't form part of the material before us now at this stage and that must be taken as a given, that your client is facing that count and that sentence and so on.

            "Just to conclude, Mr Chairman, just on that point.  Mr Chairman, I don't want to speculate and do whatever, what will have been the reason of Hladi coming up with this.  I don't want to say he was lying.  We would have the benefit if he was here to ask him certain things.  Maybe we would have got a clear picture, but what I want to say, Mr Chairman, if there was an allegation that he is an informer, definitely at that stage nobody would feel comfortable with that.  One would easily - everybody denied even though some were informers, though I don't have evidence, will deny that he's an informer, would come up with anything.\n\tI'm not trying to cast any aspersion on him because he's not here but I'm just trying to widen - that's why I didn't want to go to that length.  But there may be other reason why he came up with that, because he was said informer, he wanted to tell these guys that, \"Look, there's nothing like that.  These guys only wanted to rob me and they robbed me of this\".  \n\tAnd one wonders sometimes whether in those circumstances where you go and rob when you don't know how much are you going to get and go to somebody in his house who's drinking, that in any event, if somebody can just go there drinking just to go and rob your R100,00 and just for that specific people.  That's why, Mr Chairman, there are many questions on this aspect, but as I indicated that I want the Committee to take the whole incident in totality when they come to the stage of deciding this matter.",

And taking into account that the reason for him shooting at the policemen was he wanted to get away from them, he did not want to be arrested.\n\tMr Chairman, there is no doubt in my mind that that act was associated with political objective in the sense that he did not want to be arrested for an offence which he committed of killing a policeman.  And also that, Mr Chairman, taking into account that the policy of APLA at that time, even though in this instance for shooting at them was to avoid arrest, was to attack the policemen because they were regarded as the part of the system.  But at this particular incident he did shoot at them because he wanted to avoid arrest.  And I submit, Mr Chairman, that if the Committee accepts that he was member of APLA and at the time he committed the initial offence of Mashamahite and the attempted murder of Hladi, he was acting within the course and scope of his employment.
