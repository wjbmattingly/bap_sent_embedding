As already explained to you that this whole issue is twofold to me, my position as well as the client's position.\n\tIt now transpires that in fact, I have a difference with my client with regard to the pursuance of this matter.  I am asking for this matter to be remanded or to stand down until next week Monday, to enable me during the course of this week to prepare myself fully for this matter and I will give my reasons for that shortly.\n\tHowever, client's instructions are that although he accepts me appearing on his behalf, and although there is no problem with that whatsoever, he would rather that we proceed with the matter, not waste time and proceed with the matter not today, but tomorrow.\n\tThat obviously presents me with a problem if I am obliged to proceed with the matter on his behalf, if I am not prepared, fully prepared, then I am absolutely not in a position to do so and I am not prepared to do that.\n\tHowever, client, the applicant, Mr Bellingan also made a further suggestion which is a suggestion from his side and which I do not necessarily agree with, is that Mr Bellingan himself would like to take charge of his representation, however with the assistance of legal representation.  This is something not frequently seen, obviously in court or any forums, and I don't think the Act itself makes provision for that, criminal or civil procedure doesn't make provision for that, and I don't know to what extent that can be accommodated in this forum.\n\tHowever, to start out with my position and I think I should just put it on record, is that I received instructions in this matter from Attorneys Strydom Britz on Wednesday, last week.  I don't know what the date was, but in any event, it was just before the weekend then, a few days ago and ...",

Mr Chairman, I have now taken instructions and I will request a postponement of this matter until Thursday this week, to enable me to prepare for this matter.\n\tI may just add that Mr Bellingan's attitude is that he is very happy about the developments, he is concerned that this hearing will not be completed by the end of next week and he doesn't want the matter to carry on indefinitely.  The basis on which I ask or I put this request for a postponement of the matter until Thursday is that I did receive instructions last week Wednesday, after the withdrawal of Adv Du Plessis.\n\tDuring the course of Wednesday, Thursday and Friday I received documentation running to approximately 6000 to 7 000 pages and although I initially thought that I would be in a position to prepare fully and be ready to proceed today, it transpired that I was in fact not ready and that it will still take further time to prepare myself for this matter.\n\tWhen I make the request that the matter stand down until Thursday, I do so on the presumption that I will be able to read through all the papers and in fact prepare myself fully to pursue this matter on Thursday.\n\tMr Bellingan asked me and I can obviously expect this Committee also to ask for me whether I can give any guarantee as to whether I will be ready to proceed on Thursday, whether I would be fully prepared.  I am not in a position to give this guarantee as much as I would like to do so, and I cannot give this guarantee, however, I think that three days would give me adequate time to prepare myself and to be ready on Thursday.\n\tHowever, added to that, should it happen that I am not ready on Thursday, the instructions of client are that in those circumstances, I will then have to withdraw as his Advocate and his representative in the matter, and he will then seek the indulgence of representing himself with the assistance of some for of legal representative or person to assist him in this matter.\n\tThe bottom line, or the gist of that is that should I not be ready to proceed on Thursday, then there will be no further time wasted and the matter will be proceeded with, but then Mr Bellingan will represent himself.\n\tIf there is anything in particular that your Committee would like me to further explain about my position or Adv Du Plessis' position, I would gladly do so to the extent that I am instructed with the particulars thereof, but at this stage I can merely say that I am not ready to proceed and I need at least until Thursday to enable myself to prepare myself for this hearing.

            "Mr Chairman, we oppose the request, but let me say at the outset, we have the greatest of sympathy for the predicament in which my learned friend, Mr Hattingh finds himself, and nothing that I say should in any way be interpreted as reflecting on or doubting his predicament as he describes it.\n\tBut, the hearing is not here in the first place to protect his interest, it is here to protect the interest of the applicant and of the other parties participating in this hearing.\n\tThere are a number of us, we all convened on months' notice, for a hearing to commence today.  It would cause all of us expense and inconvenience if the matter were to be postponed.  As far as our side particularly is concerned, in the discussions that I have had with my learned friend, Mr Chaskalson, we thought that the hearing should finish this week, but may run into next week, so that we were quite confident that the two weeks set aside would be more than adequate.\n\tAs far as my own personal position is concerned, I am available this week, I am not available next week, I have to attend a hearing of the Judicial Service Commission in Cape Town for the whole week.  My own position is not important because to be perfectly frank with you, our own planning has been that my learned junior would even for this week, be running, and next week, be running the case on our behalf.\n\tBut his position is that he is clear until the second half of next week, when he also runs into difficulties.  If the matter had proceeded as was planned, those difficulties would not have occasioned my client any inconvenience or prejudices, because we were confident that we would finish before the middle of next week, when his difficulties arise.\n\tIf the matter were however, to stand down until Thursday and then run for a week as we had thought it would, with the possibility of a day or two, then serious prejudice may arise.  There is in the first place, as far as our side is concerned, in the second half of next week, at least Thursday and Friday, my learned junior is not available which would mean that our side would not have an Advocate available to represent us if this matter were to run for a week, as is expected at this stage.\n\tBut as you well know, we always underestimate the duration of these hearings, and when the lawyers' estimate is a week or possibly a bit more, then invariably these things take longer than expected.  If that were to happen in this case, to a hearing which commences only on Thursday, then there is a real risk that the hearing might not finish at all in the two weeks set aside for it. \t\n\tIt is in nobody's interest, not the interest of the Commission, the applicant or any of the objectors, that we should run any risk of failing to complete the hearings in these two weeks.\n\tSo, there is a real risk of very real and serious prejudice to all concerned, if we were to stand down until Thursday on the one hand.  What do we have on the other?  What compelling consideration is there for the request?\n\tAgain, I understand my learned friend's position entirely, but what about his client?  All his client is telling us is that my Advocate withdrew, I cannot or will not offer any explanation for his withdrawal and I now want a postponement to the prejudice and inconvenience of everybody else.  That is simply not good enough.\n\tIf and to the extent that their predicament is of their own making, they don't deserve any sympathy and indulgence.  If for some reason, the predicament was forced upon them for no fault of their own, then you might balance that consideration against the inconvenience, expense and prejudice to the other side.\n\tBut until they explain why the Advocate withdrew and persuade you that it was not a predicament made - of Mr Bellingan's own making, there is no reason to grant them any indulgence at all.\n\tI understand that my learned friend, Mr Hattingh, who discussed the case with his predecessor, may well have received information in confidence and that information may well be privileged and that he is therefore acting entirely properly when he tells you that he cannot explain to you why Adv Du Plessis withdrew.\n\tBut the same doesn't apply to his client.  He is perfectly at liberty to tell you why his Advocate withdrew, and why his Advocate found it ethically intolerable to continue acting for him.\n\tIf from that explanation it should appear that the predicament is of Mr Bellingan's own making, then there is simply no merit in his request for a postponement.  If on the other hand, it appears that he was the victim of some fortuitous circumstance beyond his control, then that would be a different matter.\n\tI would submit, I am not going to ask anybody to give evidence and I am not going to suggest that they do, but let's be quite clear, he is at liberty to give you an explanation if there is one.  For as long as he doesn't give you any explanation, you are not required to assume that this predicament is not of his own making.\n\tSo that we have on the one hand no explanation at all for the predicament in which they find themselves, and on the other hand, a serious risk of prejudice and inevitability of costs and inconvenience for all the other parties involved.  On that balance, I submit that there is no justification for a postponement.\n\tWe are in any event busy with the cross-examination of Mr Bellingan, there is very little assistance that he can get from his counsel during that cross-examination.  He has an Attorney who has been involved in the matter from the outset who can assist in the protection of the client in the meantime.  So it is not as if my learned friend will be required immediately, to perform any function which requires him to be steeped in the facts of this case.\n\tSo that no serious prejudice can result.  I would propose that we proceed and complete the cross-examination and re-examination of Mr Bellingan and proceed with this case.\n\tIf along the way, it appears that my learned friend has to perform some function for which he is ill-prepared, if at that stage there is a proper explanation as to why this switch of horses midstream was necessary, the matter might be reconsidered, but I propose that at this stage, we proceed with the hearing.

That is what we are told, happened.\n\tNow, I for one, would be very slow to accept that Adv Du Plessis acted in such irresponsible and indeed improper manner.  It would be quite improper for an Advocate engaged in this case for so long, in whom the client has made so much investment, to withdraw from the case without explanation two or three days before the resumed hearing.\n\tBut we need not dissolve the issue.  If Adv Du Plessis acted in the way that they said he did, it would have been highly improper for him to act, to withdraw without any explanation and then seemingly without justification.\n\tSo there are two possibilities.  Either we have been given the real explanation of what happened, in which event Mr Bellingan's case before you is simply my Advocate withdrew, apparently without any reason at all and now you have to give me a postponement because he withdraw without any justification at all.\n\tBut sometimes clients must suffer the prejudice of their own legal representatives' conduct and if his legal representative acted in the irresponsible and improper way that they suggest, then this is such a case.\n\tThe other possibility of course is that indeed there was an explanation given, but that Mr Bellingan simply doesn't want to tell us what it is.\n\tIn either event, you are left without any reasonable justification for their inability to go on.

May I just for purposes of this hearing, for purposes of the record and perhaps for purposes of the public perception, explain the situation which I find myself in under the circumstances.\n\tI want to say, make the submission first of all that there exists between myself and my client, a privilege, namely a legal professional privilege.  That means that I am in a position as you will well know, where I cannot from a legal point of view, disclose to you the exact reasons and the facts which have given rise to the fact that I withdrew as Mr Bellingan's counsel.\n\tI want to mention that there were certain happenings which occurred since the previous hearing, which gave rise to the fact that I had decided to withdraw from the matter.  After those facts arose, I discussed the situation with my Instructing Attorney, Mr Britz of the firm Strydom Britz.  I discussed my position with him and he thereupon terminated my mandate.\n\tThe facts which Mr Britz and I discussed pertaining to the reasons for the termination of my mandate, and the fact that I felt that there may have been reasons to withdraw from the matter, were not disclosed to Mr Nolte, who is sitting here on my right hand side.\n\tAfter Mr Britz and I decided under the circumstances, that we will not disclose those facts to Mr Nolte.  I had to make a decision last week, we had to make a decision last week if Mr Britz was going to terminate my mandate or not, and we had to make the decision as quickly as possible so as to enable somebody else to take over the matter, who would be in a position from an ethical point of view, to carry on with the matter.\n\tI believe it was I think Wednesday, last week, when I phoned Judge Potgieter's clerk after I had spoken to Mr Trengove to obtain his permission to speak to Judge Potgieter, to discuss the matter with him, and to find out from him if there would be any problem for me to arrange my withdrawal from the matter without it being necessary for me to appear this morning to do it formally.\n\tHis Secretary came back to me and indicated that that shouldn't be a problem.  After my discussion with Mr Trengove just before that discussion with Judge Potgieter's Secretary, he also gave to me an indication that that wouldn't be a problem, and I also subsequently discussed my position with Mr Wagener.\n\tAlthough I may say that the specific facts pertaining to my position, I did not disclose in any sort of detail to either Mr Wagener or Mr Trengove.\n\tI may mention one further thing which gave rise to my position and that is the nature of these proceedings and the position one finds yourself in as a legal representative in these proceedings.\n\tI may also mention and I wish to mention this, Mr Chairman, that the facts which gave rise to the situation, I want to give you the assurance here and now, are not in any way whatsoever attributable to Mr Bellingan in the sense that it relates to anything that he did to cause the situation.\n\tMr Bellingan has at all relevant times insisted on having his amnesty application heard as soon as possible, and there were times during last year when he phoned me about twice a week and my Attorney too, to pressurise us to get the matter on the role and get the matter finalised.\n\tI may also mention without going into any sort of detail that the situation which arose last week, were caused by other parties apart from Mr Bellingan.  However, it placed me in a position that I had no alternative than to take the matter up with Mr Britz, whereupon my mandate was terminated.\n\tI hope you understand that under the circumstances with reference to the legal professional privilege existing between myself and my client, Mr Bellingan, that I cannot disclose the facts which gave rise to my position and obviously although contrary view may be taken by my learned friends opposite this room, and in so far as I am allowed, I wish to make the submission that this should not be held against Mr Bellingan in any way whatsoever and that no deduction should be made because of this situation.\n\tI don't know if there are any questions from you Mr Chairman, pertaining to this.",

Thank you.\nR U L I N G\n\tThis is an application for this matter to be postponed until Thursday, the 15th of April 1999, in order to allow the new counsel, Adv Hattingh, who has been briefed to appear on behalf of the applicant, Mr Bellingan in these proceedings, further opportunity to finalise his preparations of the matter.\n\tThe application is opposed by all of the interested parties.  Adv Hattingh has indicated that he was approached to appear in these proceedings last Wednesday, that is the 7th of April 1999, that he had accepted the instruction, that he had ascertained that he was available for the two week time period reserved for this matter and that he had initially calculated that by this morning, Monday the 12th of April, he would be ready and able to proceed to deal with the matter, to effectively take over the matter from Adv Du Plessis, who has previously represented the applicant.\n\tAdv Hattingh however, indicated in submitting the application for the postponement to us, that he had miscalculated the time required in order to properly prepare himself in order to represent the applicant, that he had been confronted with amongst other things a bulky set of documentation running into some 6 000 or 7 000 pages which he had to have regard to in order to prepare.\n\tHe indicated that he was in no position to properly represent the interest of the applicant this morning, and hence the application for the matter to be postponed until Thursday in order to allow him further opportunity to prepare and to be able to proceed, to deal with the matter.\n\tAfter some questions were raised concerning the withdrawal of Adv Du Plessis from the matter, this being one of the factors relied upon, the absence of a clear explanation, relied upon by the parties opposing the application, it appeared to be proper to arrange for Adv Du Plessis to personally appear at these proceedings, and to properly deal with the question of his withdrawal.\n\tAdv Du Plessis in fact had appeared this afternoon and had explained that due to circumstances which had arisen, as we understand it, in the course of last week, it was necessary to take a decision whether or not he ought to be proceeding with the matter on behalf of the applicant.\n\tHe indicated that once it became clear that he was in no position to be able to properly continue in representing the applicant, his mandate was terminated by his Instructing Attorneys and at that stage, which appears to be approximately Wednesday last week, steps were taken to obtain the services of alternative counsel to deal with the matter.\n\tIt appears to us that there is no fault that could be attributed to the applicant concerning the circumstances giving rise to the withdrawal of Adv Du Plessis, from the matter.  Adv Du Plessis has expressly indicated that much to us when he did appear.  \n\tThe application is being opposed on the basis that the interested parties would be prejudiced should the matter not proceed immediately and be finalised without delay.  There are some difficulties surrounding the availability of counsel which resulted from an understanding that this matter is expected to last for no more than about a week and that moreover there is a real likelihood should the matter be delayed at this stage, of it not being completed in the time which has been reserved for the matter to be finalised.\n\tWe have considered all of the arguments which were addressed to us.  In our view it is in the interest of justice for this matter not to proceed today and for a further opportunity to be afforded to applicant's legal representatives, particularly Adv Hattingh, to prepare to represent his interest.\n\tIt is however also in our view in the interest of justice, for the matter not to be delayed unduly and for it to in fact be concluded within the time period which has been set aside for doing so.\n\tIn all the circumstances we have decided to grant the application for a postponement.  However, in our view there is merit in the submission of Mr Rautenbach in this regard that a postponement should be a limited one, taking into account the interest of the other parties who might be negatively affected by an unduly lengthy postponement of the matter.\n\tWe have accordingly come to the conclusion that it would leave sufficient time for further preparation should this matter be postponed until Wednesday, the 14th of April 1999, that is coming Wednesday and the matter is therefore accordingly postponed to Wednesday, 14 April 1999 to this venue for the cross-examination of the applicant to proceed at nine o'clock in the morning.\n\tThe matter is accordingly postponed until Wednesday.\nCOMMITTEE ADJOURNS",
