<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Mabote, are you withdrawing your whole application or are you continuing with part of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOTE:</span> I withdraw the case about murder, what I apply for is the possession of illegal firearms and ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Now could you tell us please why didn't you mention in your application when you were ask for particulars about the acts you are asking for, why didn't you mention the illegal firearms, the possession of the illegal firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOTE:</span> They appear in my application.  They appear because I was in possession of them, it is clear in my application that I left them, they were with me then I handed them over.  There were three things which appeared in my application.  Firstly it's murder which perhaps I thought I am involved because when I made this application it was at the time when I was confused and I did not have help and I didn't know as to whether</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>should I apply because even when you look at the date you'd see it was the last date of the submission of the applications therefore I was obliged because I did not know, I was obliged therefore to make an application.  After I met my legal representative it was clear that in the true sense I was not involved about the two incidents except the possession of illegal firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did you hand in a firearm when they requested you to do so after the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOTE:</span> As appears in my application, during the elections of 1994 I was outside the country.  In 1992 I went outside the country because my life was in danger then I was advised to go out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What has happened to that firearm and ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOTE:</span> According to my knowledge they were handed over to the general Amnesty Committee after the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you do with it, that firearm and ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MABOTE:</span> I made it clear in my application that I left them in the township, I left them with Comrade Sam and Comrade Lucky.  Thereafter they took them to the stadium where all members of self defence unit handed over all their firearms.  I was present at the stadium when they were handed over, then I was satisfied that they handed over the firearms and as a leader of the ANC we were - that was when people turned over their firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes thank you, the applications would therefore be referred for chamber attention.  They are all excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEIN:</span> Thank you.  Are we being excused in the meantime?  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> Mr Chairperson, might I at this stage point out to the Committee and place on record that since I appeared here yesterday I also received instructions to act on behalf of Mrs Doris Sambo who is named as a victim in the application of Mogoera Modikoa, number 7212/97 and place myself on record in that regard as well before we proceed with the applications.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that an application that we've dealt with already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWANEPOEL:</span> No Mr Chairperson, it's one to be dealt with.</p>
