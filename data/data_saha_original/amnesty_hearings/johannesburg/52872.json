In essence, regarding the procedure, they persist in their opposition to this application on the grounds that it is neither politically motivated in the sense that this is a continuation of criminal activities of the applicants.  And secondly, on the ground of disclosure, that on the papers before this Committee there are material contradictions in the versions and the truth is not being told on the papers before the Committee.  We have then consulted with family members, together with Mr Mapoma, and they understand that I have not had opportunity to familiarise myself with the papers to the same extent as my learned friend has, and that he's in fact in a better position to oppose the application at this stage than I am and they are therefore satisfied that he continue acting on their behalf in opposing both applications.

The facts to which I deposed are true and correct and within my personal knowledge, unless the context states otherwise.  I was born in Soweto, Gauteng on the 16th of March 1972 and I grew up in the Gauteng Province.  I left school at standard six due to financial problem.  I joined PAC in 1991 and I was recruited by Moss ...\"\nMr Chairman, the spelling of Moss will be a double \"s\".  Thank you.\n\"...who was an APLA cadre.  At the time he recruited me I was just an ordinary supporter of PAC.  Moss recruited myself Lulamile and Doctor.  He taught us how to handle explosive and weapons.\"\nMr Mvijane, can you, with regard to that paragraph, tell the Committee, before you were recruited by Moss what were you doing?  What were your activities?",

            "Before I got to know Moss, I grew up being a delinquent and I was involved in gangsterism and stealing cars.  I even got arrested for car theft as well as rape, two counts of rape.  As time went on Moss came to me.  It was the first time I saw him.  It was myself, Lulamile as well as Doctor when we were visited by Moss.  We were smoking dagga when he got to my place, that is where I was staying with my mother.  We were quite surprised as to what his visit entailed, but he wanted us to share the joint with him, that is the dagga joint.  We gave it to him.  He also requested us to give him some more of the dagga because he was not satisfied with the one that he got from us.  We explained to him that it was finished.  Then he gave us a R50,00 note to buy some more dagga.  Lulamile Kkwankwa took the money and he went to buy some more dagga.  Lulamile Khwankwa came back with the dagga and we smoked and also bought food with the money from Moss.\n\tAnd Moss at that stage started asking me as to which political organisations I belonged to or we belonged to.  I told him that we were not involved in any politics, but I had a desire to join or support the PAC.  And he asked me as to what we were doing idling in the location.  I told him that I was involved in gangsterism and he explained to me that it was not a good idea for me to belong to a gangster or a group of criminals, and he further asked me to stop being a member of the gangster.  I agreed with him, because what he was saying to me was quite true and that's when I realised the mistakes that I had committed before as a growing young man, and I was recruited by Moss.  \n\tHe asked me as to whether I was able to use a firearm and I told him that I was not able to because I had never handled a firearm before.  He asked me whether I knew how to handle an AK47.  I told him that I'd never seen an AK.  And he asked me as to whether I had a desire to see or handle it.  I agreed with him and said I wanted to see the AK47.  \n\tHe further explained to me that he does not have a place to stay and he wanted to stay with me.  But I explained it to him that we had hired the place which was not our own place and we shared the house with the people who stayed there, that is the owners of the house.  So I was not able to give him a place of abode.  Maybe if I could get my own place we could share.  I talked to the owners of the house who explained that if he was not a problematic person he could join us in that house.  So we stayed together with Moss, though I don't remember as to what the date was when we started staying together and what month it was.  \n\tI stayed with Moss and he let me into the secrets of the PAC and also made me politically aware and conscious of the political climate that existed at that time.  He told me that the enemies were police, soldiers, as well as all the other people who were working for the previous regime.  He explained to me that he wanted myself, Lulamile as well as Doctor to be members of the PAC who were going to fight for the black nation against the oppressive Government rather than being criminals.",

            "Thank you.  Mr Chairman, I will proceed to paragraph 6 as he has already covered also paragraph 5.\n\"At the time he had two AK47s, Makarov pistol and two stick grenades.  He told us PAC and APLA do not have enough funds to buy weapons.  It is therefore going to be the duty of the unit to repossess arms from the State, that is SADF, SAP, traffic officers and any other law enforcement agents and also from the white people who were benefitting from the oppressive system of apartheid.  Moss told us that the South African Defence Force, SAP and traffic officer were the main pillars of apartheid and they have to be attacked and render the system of apartheid unworkable because the whites will no longer have confidence to the State if the people who are supposed to protect them are unable to protect themselves.  Moss told us that he was reporting his action to the director of operations, Leklapa Mpampahlele.  He told us that it will be our duty that at night we will patrol the street looking for police to attack them and repossess their weapons.  On the night of the 19th August 1991 we patrolled the street looking for the target.  It was Moss armed with AK47, myself armed with Makarov, Lulamile armed with Chinese stick grenade and also Doctor armed with Chinese stick grenade.  We could not find the target until in the morning and Moss ordered us to go to our respective places.  Moss and Lulamile went to their respective places and in the case of Moss he went to my home.  Myself, I accompanied Doctor to his home.  On our way we saw the traffic officer in the street and we decided to disarm him.  I told the traffic officer not to move and he tried to draw his pistol and I shot him.  Doctor took the pistol and we ran away.  On the way we met Lulamile who asked us what was happening and we told him what had happened, and I asked him to go to the place of the incident and check whether there are no people who saw us.  We went to my home where we made a report to Moss.  Lulamile came back and told us that there was a young boy who was talking to the police and told them who shot the traffic officer.

We asked the owner to keep the Makarov and the traffic officer's gun.  After some time we saw the police and traffic officers' vehicles stopping outside.  We decided to shoot them, but before we did that Moss noticed that there was a woman and it was my mother.  We then ran away through the back door.  We went to Meadowlands and we slept there, and the following day Moss left to attend another APLA cadre who was suffering from malaria.  We also went to Pimville, that is Klipspruit, to take the trafficker's pistol and on our way back we boarded a minibus taxi and it was stopped by the police and we were arrested.  We were assaulted by the police and we had to say something to save our skins.

            "After the arrest, the police retrieved the gun that I had thrown under the car seat.  They realised that this was the gun that belonged to the traffic officer, and they asked us whose gun this was.  Nobody owned up to the gun and that's when they started assaulting the taxi driver who referred them to the passengers and said, \"You should ask the people at the back\", and there's another guy who was assaulted and he was innocent, but he was just sitting in front of me, that is the seat in front of mine.  The person was assaulted until such time that he told the police and he pointed me out as the person who had put the gun underneath the chair and that was true, I'm the one who put that gun underneath the seat.  They also told the police that there were the three of us.\n\tThey identified us and the three of us were taken and put into a blue Jetta.  It was a police car.  We were taken to a certain police station.  I'm not able to distinguish between the Moroka Police Station and the Jabulani Police Station, but we were taken to one of those police stations.  There we were further assaulted and told to tell the police as to where we got this firearm.  We ended up confessing and explaining to the police that the gun had been sent to us or we had been sent by Moss to go and get the gun from a certain traffic officer, and the police wanted to know as to what position Moss was in or what was he to send us to go and get a gun.  We explained to the police that he was a member of APLA and they required us to do a pointing out.  \n\tWe proceeded to Pimville.  I knew that we could get Moss at a certain place and I pointed the place out.  I further requested the police to take me out of the car because I did not want to be seen pointing out and I knew that something was going to happen when we got to Moss' place or Moss' hide-out.  And the police were quite shocked by my statement and they never stopped in front of the hide-out, but they went the opposite direction and parked at a certain corner, and they told me that they were not going to release me, they opened up the boot of the car and put myself and Lulamile Khwankwa inside the boot.  And the car was started and went slowly down the street and stopped at a certain house.  I could hear them shutting the doors after them as they were getting out of the car, together with Doctor.  \n\tAfter a few minutes, though I'm not able to say how many minutes, I could hear gunfire which I could identify as coming from an AK47 and there were some bullets that hit the car as well as the boot of the car whilst we were inside, and I started praying inside the boot because I was scared to death.  And I was scared that Moss would probably throw a handgrenade in the car.  The gunshots went on and we could hear the police gunfire, because at that stage I was able to differentiate between an AK47 and the police guns.  After some relative quiet I heard a big or loud explosion which I thought to be a grenade.  \n\tThereafter I heard some AK gunfire from a distance and at that stage I thought or realised that he was probably running away and they were chasing him, that's why the gunfire was getting fainter and fainter.  I realised thereafter that I had been shot on the leg and the police threw me out of the boot.  There was a black policeman who is a Sotho speaker, who said, \"Here's your person, he's dead now\".  And the police dragged me and when they dragged me I saw Doctor lying in front of the gate.  At that stage I do not know whether he was dead or alive.  They dragged me into the ambulance together with one black policeman.  I was taken to the Baragwanath Hospital.  \n\tWhen I got to Baragwanath there were already policemen there.  They were not more than 10.  Some were lying on the stretcher, quite a number of them.  The police with whom I arrived told the nursing sisters at Baragwanath that these are the people who are killing the police and the nurses asked me as to why we were killing police.  I denied any knowledge of that allegation.  I was treated by the nursing sister.  I was treated with a certain spray or certain medication and given some tablets.  I was dressed and transported to the Kliptown Police Station.  I spent the night there.  The following morning I was assaulted.  I was kicked and I was bleeding at that stage.  I tried to put on my left shoe.  My foot was swollen.  I could not wear any shoes and I was taken to the offices at the second floor.  That's where I came across some women from the house or the hide-out where Moss was.  As to why they were there I have no idea, but we were put in vacant rooms.  Murder and Robbery police from Protea were also present.  They asked me from my ...[end of tape].  That is when the severest of the assaults started.  We were taken into a Husky police minibus, a blue one.  \n\tWe were transported to the Protea Police Station where we were put into a certain hall.  There were a lot of policemen there, as well as traffic officers.  We were questioned and assaulted at the same time.  They also used some wheel spanners to assault us.  I ultimately had to admit that I shot the traffic officer.  They wanted to know as to who took the gun.  I told them that it was Doctor, but they did not believe me, they said I was talking \"shit\", and I was actually painting Doctor black because he could not speak for himself, he was dead.  I ended up saying it was Lulamile who had taken the traffic cop's gun.  A question from the police with regard to money came.  They also questioned us about a wristwatch.  I never answered any questions with regard to that because we never robbed the traffic officer.  \n\tEven if I knew something about it, I wouldn't have admitted it because I had been a criminal before and have been involved in criminal activity.  We were taken, that is myself and Lulamile who had also confessed to having taken the gun, we were put into different cells.  A few days thereafter I was taken.  I was tubed, electrocuted so that I could submit a statement to the police.  The first statement that I submitted was true, but in the middle of the statement they rejected whatever was said.  They kept on saying that I was talking \"shit\", and I was going to speak the truth.  That's when I started lying because I wanted to satisfy them as well as save my life, because we were being assaulted severely.  \n\tIn that statement I also said I had shot a traffic officer because I had been promised some money and they asked me as to who promised me money.  I told them that Moss had promised us a sum of R1 800 for killing the traffic officer.  When I told that lie I could see that the police were not satisfied that I was a hired assassin.  I was taken to the Brixton Murder and Robbery Squad where they told me that I was going to submit a statement to the Chief Magistrate.  He was a white person and I don't know whether he was an Englishman or an Afrikaans-speaking person.  This person reprimanded me that I was to speak the truth and only the truth.  \n\tI started off with the truth and when I got to the middle of the statement with regard to the payment, I tried to avoid the payment portion and this Chief Magistrate said, \"You are now starting to speak 'shit', and I'm still going to call the people who assaulted you before to come and deal with you\", and that dawned on me that he had already been told about me.  I continued with the lie of being paid or having been promised a sum of R1 800.  And I continued to submit a lie of a statement.  Thereafter I was transported to Protea where I was put in a cell.",
