The country had just undergone two states of emergencies, 1985 and 1986.  There was complete chaos and turmoil in our townships and particularly amongst our youth.\n\tThere was on the other hand, an offensive launched by the liberation movement, against the regime.  Cadres of the liberation movement was being infiltrated in great numbers, automatic weapons could be found in abundance in our townships and the weapons I am referring to, are not the weapons that were being carried for criminal purposes, but for the furthering of the political aims of the liberation movement, which was to overthrow the government of the day.\n\tChairperson, it is during this time and in that political context, and in reaction to that context that this offence was committed.  Looking at all the probabilities, the motive behind this killing, was political.  There was no personal gain by any of the four applicants, in terms of the evidence that has come before you.\n\tIn applying your minds Honourable Committee members, to this application, I wish to urge you to be subjective, to place yourselves in the applicant's shoes at that time.

I will nevertheless proceed and please bear with me where I repeat what you have said Chairperson.\n\tThe first applicant stood in a position of authority to all the other three applicants.  He was their mentor and their commander and their involvement in the killing of Sicelo was merely following an order issued by their commander.\n\tAs for the last two applicants, the ones you have just referred to Chairperson, on the day in question, they were just phoned by their immediate commander who ordered them to be on standby and soon thereafter, he came and fetched them, taken them to a place which was familiar to them, a place which they had used for meetings previously.\n\tAccording to the evidence before you, within a minute of their arrival at this place, Sicelo was shot.  It was only after that event, that a brief explanation was given to them by their Overall commander and were further ordered to keep this matter a secret.\n\tNo action on their part, could have spared Sicelo's life.  At no time, in their presence, was Sicelo's execution ever mentioned.  However, in the light of the information furnished to them by their Overall commander, the order issued to keep this matter a secret and their subsequent elaborate cover up, they associate themselves with this killing.  It is purely on those basis that they apply for amnesty for the killing of Sicelo Dhlomo and come before you.\n\tThe second applicant, I believe his situation is also not very different.  He was also told by his commander that Sicelo was a police informer, shown some broken device and told it was a transmitter, a radio transmitter and it was on the spot decided by the commander, that is the first applicant, that Sicelo must be executed.\n\tIt was as you were told, not a joint decision.  From the moment this decision was made, all the relevant disclosures before you, with regard to the second applicant, his going to fetch the other two and the pulling of the trigger, indicate that he was also merely following orders.\n\tThe first applicant, his situation is somewhat different and perhaps problematic.  If there is any blame to be laid, this blame may be put at his door, and perhaps I should briefly deal with the problems.\n\tThe first thing I want to deal with his whether the applicant was empowered by his organisation, to make such a drastic decision.  If one looks at the fact that he was a commander, instructed to form a Unit and arm these Units for operations against the government, this will lead us to whether he needed approval or to act on orders with regard to matters of safety of his cells or Units.\n\tI respectfully submit that his mission into the country, carried an implied mandate that he should at his discretion act in the best interest of his Unit, in terms of protecting them, and possibly to kill if this will ensure the safety of his activities.",

Then from there on, I proceed to extract the second list and that the list of other factors that I submit, have been established.  \tIt is a somewhat more lengthy list which goes to some 17 points.  I will proceed.  The first is that the deceased was a member of the Soweto Students' Congress, SOSCO, certainly in 1986 and at that time, was a well-known political activist;  the second point at the age of 15 in and during the period June 1986, he was held in detention under existing legislation.  I refer to page 49 and 50 of the TRC bundle, but since I hand it in, I won't go through that.\n\tAgain on the 6th of December, he was acquitted on a charge of attempted murder, alternatively public violence and arson;  fourth, that Dhlomo was charged with possession of a firearm and subsequently received a five year suspended sentence;  my typing is erroneous here, I say suspended statement.\n\tParagraph 5, the fifth point, in March 1987 and in subsequent months, Sicelo Dhlomo conducted several interviews with the foreign media regarding his political activity, his experiences in detention and other related matters.  Sixth point, again in March/April 1987, Dhlomo participated in the making of the documentary Children under Apartheid.\n\tThen the October incident is the seventh point.  On 12 October Dhlomo was detained briefly by members of the Security Forces in Soweto.  Eight, between October 1987 and January 1988, Sicelo Dhlomo worked as a volunteer on a continuous basis at the offices of the DPSC in Khotso House, Johannesburg.\n\tNine, during this period Dhlomo was staying with Joe Tsawela at his flat in Hillbrow and occasionally visiting his family in Soweto.  Also during this period, to return to that point, Clive Makhubu and Sipho Humphrey Tshabalala were seen at the offices of the DPSC, visiting Dhlomo.\n\tIn December 1987, the television documentary was broadcast.  On 20 January, Dhlomo was arrested at the DPSC offices in Johannesburg, in connection with his participation in the documentary and released later that day.\n\tThe purposes of the detention, was to obtain a statement, as is documented in the news clipping from Dhlomo to discredit the bona fides of the documentary Children under Apartheid, TRC bundle page 63 and the statement made by the deceased, to the South African Police at John Vorster Square, which is contained in the docket.\n\tFourteen, on 23 January 1988, Dhlomo left for Soweto with his firearm and on Tsawela's evidence, two handgrenades and had R1 000 to R1 500 on him.",

That is the best, the furthest we can take it.  On 24 January, Dhlomo meets up with Sipho Tshabalala whilst wearing red shoes, red socks, grey black trousers and a red T-shirt and has with him money, his diary, a cassette walkman which he wears on his hip.",

The last point from this category is that the cassette walkman was loaned to DPSC workers, Joe Tsawela, Ntombi Masekeri and a witness that we hadn't called.\n\tThen the next list of matters is what cannot be accepted.  The first I think we have already covered and that is that the deceased, Mr Dhlomo, was a police informer.  There is no evidence.\n\tThe next, it is obvious that no honest and genuine effort as alleged by some of the witnesses, was made to communicate with Dhlomo during the period of his supposed disappearance.\n\tThe third point, Mr Dube alleges that Dhlomo confessed to the allegation, which is not typed, that he was an informer.  This cannot be corroborated by anyone else.  I don't agree and I submit that Mr Dube's evidence cannot be accepted in this regard.",

            "It is quite correct.  On Ntombi Masekeri's evidence, she accepted the addition that the purpose of making the admission was to get the police off his back, for whatever reason.\n\tOn other occasions in that list, similar statements have been made, that he had done the same.  What I argue on that point is if that had been Mr Dube's case, why did he need to fabricate all sorts of other points on which to corroborate himself or to corroborate his opinion?  He didn't make out that case at any stage at all.\n  \tThe fourth point is that we need not ask ourselves to accept, is that there was a sufficiency or adequate evidence to justify the cell taking disciplinary steps against the deceased.  We have been through the matter of what evidence did he have, how long he had been out of contact and if he was an informer, which I submit there was no substantial evidence of.\n\tThe fifth point, they had no alternative but to take immediate action to kill Mr Dhlomo.  Mr Dube's and Mr Makhubu's behaviour was completely inconsistent with the bona fide belief that Mr Dhlomo was an informer and that they were in imminent danger of being trapped as a result of the alleged transmission from the so-called transmitter.\n\tThe next thing that I submit cannot be accepted, there is no basis for it, that the shooting of the deceased was a bona fide MK operation. \tNext point, that this assassination was or is sanctioned by the ANC or MK.  I have had reference to the ANC's submission to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, dated 12 May 1997.  The written submission set out in Appendix 4, does not make any reference to this particular event.\n\tThe next point that I don't believe we need to accept is that there was any necessity at all for all four members of the cell to be present at the execution.",

This simply didn't happen and there is no evidence that Mr Dube advanced to substantiate his belief that it happened.\n\tThe transmitter radio is the third leg of his argument.  Masekeri and Tsawela all confirm that Dhlomo wore a walkman portable radio on his hip as might any teenager.   Tshabalala goes further to say that he was wearing this on the day of the discovery of the so-called transmitter.\n\tOf all the applicants, only Dube saw the device before it was smashed into pieces.
