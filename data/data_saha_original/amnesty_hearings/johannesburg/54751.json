He was represented by counsel at the inquest, and I'm reminded that the transcript that we have produced because we didn't want any arguments about translation, that there was an agreed translation which was agreed with his counsel, and these are the agreed transcripts.  So he's not a stranger to this, nor will he be surprised by their contents.\n\tMr Chairman, unfortunately this short clip from the video had no sound, no fault of ours, this is how it came to us and we ask the Committee to see video 3 of Mr von Eggedy in front of Shell House near or at the corner of King George and De Villiers Streets.\n\tWe could not definitely identify, but it was probably a foreign news gathering crew that must have come there after the event, Mr Chairman.  Those are the three videos that we wanted to show.  I would ask the Committee to receive a document from us, copies of which are available, and my learned friend, Mr Burger will identify the document and couple them with the ballistics evidence that has been placed before you.

            "Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson, we've put the documents into a new bundle which we've called bundle \"D\" and we've numbered it through from page 1 through to page 53.\n\tWhat the bundle seeks to do is to put the ballistics evidence which was led at the inquest, and which is not disputed by any of the parties, before the Committee so that the evidence which has been led and further evidence which may be led can be seen in its context.  The memorandum itself, Chairperson, is very short, it runs for the first six pages.  In going through the memorandum I will refer the Committee to the various annexures and I will just highlight the various parts of those annexures to help the Committee read through the memorandum.  I'm not going to go through each annexure in detail.\n\tWhat we say in the memorandum is that the ballistics evidence essentially falls into two categories.  The first category concerns the observations of the experts at Shell House and Lancet Hall and the conclusions drawn from those observations.  The second part concerns the exhibits which were picked up, seized by the Police immediately after the shooting at Shell House, which were analyzed by Superintendent Du Plessis, and as a result of his analysis certain conclusions can be drawn.\n\tI deal firstly with the observations at Shell House.  Superintendent Du Plessis conducted an investigation at Shell House on the day after the incident, the 29th of March.  His report is contained in a document called Exhibit \"Y2\", and that's already been shown to the Committee, you will recall photographs of King George Street and the Woburn Pharmacy and the Cobbler's shop and all of that, that is the Exhibit \"Y2\" that ...(intervention)",

            "No, no, it wasn't a video Chairperson, it was the - it were those photographs that were shown to a witness.  In fact I handed my file up to Justice Ngcobo during that examination.  Now that is Exhibit \"Y2\".  It's also referred to in some detail in the joint ballistic report which I will come to in a moment.  That joint ballistic report was commissioned by the ANC, the IFP, the families of the deceased and the injured, as well as the SAP.  It was a joint report, and that report appears in bundle \"B\" at pages 159 - 188.  What has been left out of that - of the bundle are the photographs which are attached to that report.  They're available if any member of the Committee wants to see those photographs.\n\tWe say that the gist of the joint report is summarised in the seven sketch plans which are annexed to the report.  The seven sketch plans that I'm referring to appear at pages 182 - 188 of bundle \"B\", and what we say, Chairperson, is that these sketch plans together with the report indicate certain basic propositions.  The first proposition is set out in paragraph 4.1 of the memorandum, that is that shots were fired both in the direction of Shell House and in the direction of the marchers.  Now one can see that from the various sketch plans, if I could just take the Committee to the sketch plans.  I'm starting at page 182 of bundle \"B\".  What sketch plan no 1 shows, it's a reconstruction of the investigation by Superintendent Du Plessis on the day after the incident, the 29th of March 1994.  The shots into Jabu's Bakery are reflected - the ten shots are reflected there, the shots into Shell House are shown as SW6, SW4, SW3.   The shots under the parapet of Shell House, SW1, SW2 is the ricochet, which he didn't know about at the time, but which subsequently became apparent after the joint investigation, and the boxes a, b, c and d represent the following, a represents a car which was parked in King George Street on the day of the shooting and into which shots were fired;  b is another vehicle which was there on the day of the shooting and into which shots were fired;  c is a concrete block which was positioned in King George Street;  and d is were the Woburn Pharmacy used to be, you will recall, Chairperson, that the Woburn Pharmacy at the time of the shooting was at the corner and has subsequently moved to being the third shop in King George Street.  The reason that these four areas are shaded in is to show that they couldn't be confirmed by the other experts, because they no longer existed at the time of the joint investigation, but they are not disputed by anybody.  \n\tSketch plan no 2 over the page at 183 indicates shots that were fired from Shell House towards Jabu's Bakery from De Villiers Street, you will see there are two shots fired towards Jabu's Bakery, in particular I'm referring to shot marked no 4 and the shot marked no 5, you will see they come from that blue area, and that blue area in the key is described as the area from where there was firing, \"area van waar gevuur is\".  It also indicates shots being fired from that area into the north-western corner of Shell House.  Other shots are also indicated there, and the difference between the blue lines and the red lines, is the blue lines represent handguns and the red lines represent high calibre rifles such as an AK47.\n\tSketch plan 3 at page 184 ...(intervention)",

            "Yes, we're happy with that, we have no problem.  \tIf I can then move to sketch plan no 3 on page 184, now, this sketch plan indicates shots fired at with a high calibre rifle, probably an AK47, from Shell House, P1 - P9 in the direction of the upper floors of Jabu's Bakery, so that's in a north-westerly direction, and B1 - B6 in the direction of the upper floors of the flats over the road from Shell House between - in King George Street between De Villiers Street and Plein Street.  They're all high calibre shots, except for B3, you will see there's some doubt in the minds of the experts as to whether B3 was a handgun or a high calibre shot, and that's why it's shaded in both red and blue.  You'll see in the key that dotted red and blue line is \"a geweer/handwapen\", either.  Now, what's also interesting from sketch plan 3 is that there are two areas blocked off, the one is blocked off in a dark dotted line, a longer dotted line, and that is P1 - P9 in the key, it's the \"vuurarea balkon\", the firing area from the balcony, and the dotted lines at the bottom, the - from P1 - P9, no, it's also to P9, but smaller dots if I can put it that way, also black dots is the \"vuurarea straatvlak\", the firing area from the street.  And you will also see that the red lines which go into the parapet become dotted at the bottom and continue towards the street, and that is because the experts were not able to state categorically that those shots were fired from the balcony or fired from street level, what they did was, they worked out the approximate trajectory of the shot wherever they found it on the building, tracked it back, but they couldn't state categorically whether it came from the parapet or whether it came from street level.  And that's why you will see the dotted lines.\n\tIf I could then move to sketch plan no 4 at page 185.  This brings me back to paragraph 4.2 of the memorandum, where we say that the shots which were fired in the direction of Shell House included shots fired from AK47s, handguns and at least one shotgun.  Again I assume Mr Dorfling will be in agreement with me, if I can leave out SO3, SO2, SO1, SN1 and SN2 for the purposes of the present discussion.  Well, perhaps SN1 and SN2 might not be left out, they might have some relevance because we know that the crowd was in that vicinity.  And then there was also evidence from an SA at the time, and SADF soldier who fired a shot with a R5 rifle at the marchers, and his testimony was that he fired a shot because he was shot at, and he fired the shot in vicinity - he was in De Villiers Street, he was shot as in De Villiers Street, and it's possible that those shots might link up, except he said that he was shot at with an AK47, and these shots are shots are depicted as being from a handgun.",

At page 174 of the report, this is 174 of bundle \"B\", it's typed page 14 of the report, under the heading \"Trefpunt BN3\", you will recall that that relates to the shotgun marks on sketch plan 4.  The following is said, it's photo 21, it says there - I beg your pardon photos 22, 23 and 24.  The report says,\n\"Die beskadigingsmerke is veroorsaak deur agt haelkorrels wat die onderkant van die balkon aan die noorde kant van Baronie getref het.  Die skoot is skuins opwaarts in 'n oostelike rigting soos op die sketsplan aangedui, gevuur.  Die groote van die haelkorrels kan \"SG\" of \"LG\" wees.\"\nAgain no indication that these weren't fired on the day of the shooting.  If the Committee would just turn to page 7 of bundle \"D\", you will see an annexure there, Annexure \"A\", which shows the different sizes of ammunition, shotgun ammunition.  SSG was fired by the Shell House security guards on the day, and you will see that there are 16 shots per cartridge in an SSG cartridge.  SG has got 10 pellets, and LG has got 7 pellets, do you see that Chairperson?  Now the report indicates that there were 8 shotgun pellets on the underside - or shotgun marks on the underside of the balcony in De Villiers Street, and the experts said that those were either SG or LG pellets.  And we make the point in paragraph 4.2 that if they were LG pellets, then at least two shots must have been fired.  If they were SG pellets, then two of the pellets didn't strike the building and landed up somewhere else.\n\tIf I could then move to 4.3.  4.3 deals with shots fired in the direction of the marchers, not in the direction of Shell House and we say there that those shots include shots fired from AK47s and handguns.  We know that the Shell House security guards fired two AK47s, the one was fired by Mr Molefe, the other one was fired by Mr Khumalo.  According to Superintendent Du Plessis, at least one of the shots fired from an AK47 could have been fired up King George Street from a position above Nandos.  Now, I don't know if the Committee is aware of where Nandos is, we will hand in a photograph, perhaps I should hand it in now.  These are colour copies of the photographs, they're quite expensive and our attorneys couldn't make more copies, we have five copies, can I hand them up to the Committee.  Chairperson, this will have to be given an Exhibit number in due course, but this photograph was taken in King George Street, looking south in King George Street between Plein Street and De Villiers Street looking south, and we're looking at the northern most point of Small Street Mall.  Just to the right of Nandos is the entrance to the Small Street Mall.  What Superintendent Du Plessis said was that the shot - a shot could have been fired from one of the flats above Nandos - I'm sorry, Nandos is shown, I don't know Chairperson if you can see Nandos, that red canopy has the name Nandos written across.",

What we've done is, we've copied all the relevant pages.

U Edele, in een van my verslae as ek dit net miskien kan byvoeg, het ek hierdie skoot ook nie uitgesluit dat dit kon gevuur gewees het uit die suidelike woonstel gedeeltes van Nandos, want ek is pertinent daaroor gevra omdat daar bewering was dat mense geskiet het vanuit daardie gebou.

The shots that were fired into the air and over the heads of the marchers are the shots that are depicted on sketch plan 3, accepting of course that those shots were fired on that day.  And then we make the point in 4.5 that certain of the shots which were fired in the direction of Shell House did not reach Shell House and might well have struck one or more of the marchers instead, we've dealt with that already.\n\tAs far as the remaining sketch plans are concerned, sketch plan 5 really deals with visibility, those are not shots - gunshots which are depicted there, it's from a certain position on street level, one can see a certain floor or floors of Shell House, those are definitely not gunshots depicted on sketch plan 5.  And then sketch plan 6 and 7 show the relevant measurements.\n\tThe only point of the joint report which requires further comment, Chairperson, is the paragraph headed, \"Trefpunte SW1\", which appears in bundle \"B\" at page 169, I'm dealing with paragraph 5 of our memorandum.  In summary, what the report says is that those shots which were fired into the underside of the balcony at the corner of King George and Plein Street, there are 12 holes and all 12 holes are AK47, that is indicated by all those red lines moving up as well as the red line - the thick red line.  Now I've annexed at page 35 of the memorandum the relevant part of Superintendent Du Plessis's evidence where he was asked about those 12 holes and where he was questioned on 2 of the 12, if I could just stand back for a minute, 10 of the 12 were associated together, and then there were 2 which were further south, in fact on the other side of a advertising board, and he was asked whether those two that were further south were compatible with 9mm shots and not AK47 shots.  And he says at line 20, or he's asked at line 20, page 35, \n\"Again let me just put it to you shortly, you have already said that you cannot exclude that might be a handgun, those two holes are completely compatible with a handgun, a 9mm?\"\nand his answer is,\n\"I can exclude it - ek kan dit nie uitsluit nie Edele.\"\nAnd then he's asked further, \n\"Would you - perhaps could you just go a little bit further, it is completely compatible.\"\nand is answer,\n\"Ja, dit is heeltemaal versoenbaar met 'n 9mm wapen of enige ander groot kaliber handwapen.\"\nThat evidence and that concession by Superintendent Du Plessis is very important, Chairperson, you would already have heard the evidence that when the guards fired warning shots, Mr Veejay Ramie, now deceased, fired two warning shots with a 9mm handgun directly upwards into the balcony, and originally the report didn't provide any support for that because it was 12 AK47 shots, but read with the evidence of Du Plessis, the concession was made that those first two shots are completely compatible with a 9mm handgun.\n\tIf I could then turn to page 3 of the memorandum, dealing with the observations at Lancet Hall.  Again there was a joint report commissioned.  The joint report was preceded by a report by Mr Lubbe who was appointed to act on behalf of the ANC.  Mr Lubbe's report was subsequently agreed to and included in the joint report.  The joint report appears at pages 189 - 196 of bundle \"B\" and particularly paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 at pages 191 and 192 are of importance.  I won't read them, I will just summarise what they say, and it's particularly relevant in the light of the evidence which the Committee has just heard from Mr Simelane, and that is, the experts agreed, no 1, that the deceased was struck and killed by a bullet fired from a high calibre rifle, Mr Chonco the deceased represented by Mr van Wyk this morning, he was struck and killed by a bullet fired from a high calibre rifle, they said it was either R1, R5 or AK47.  7.2,\n\"The deceased was not struck\", it was positively excluded, \"not struck by a shotgun pellet\",\nand 3,\n\"The damage to the inner side of the garage gate was caused by a shot fired from a shotgun.\"\nWhat happened was, that Mr Lubbe went to the gate and inspected it, and he found damage on the inside of the gate which was consistent with shots fired from a shotgun.  That then concludes the observations and the joint report.  What then happened was - well what in fact in time happened a lot earlier, was that certain exhibits were recovered from Shell House and recovered from the bodies of the deceased.  Those exhibits were analyzed by Superintendent Du Plessis.  The exhibits recovered by the Police at Shell House are listed in Superintendent Du Plessis's affidavit which was apposed to him in June 1994, that is copied for the Committee at page 8 of the memorandum and marked \"B\", the Andries Hendrik du Plessis is the Superintendent du Plessis who gave evidence at the inquest.",

            "No, Chairperson, my watch stopped at 09h20 on the 11th of May.  Chairperson, page 4, paragraph 10 of the memorandum, we've just - we've included annexure \"D\" which is a letter, it starts at page 15, it's pages 15 and 16 of the bundle, 17 was taken from the docket, it's a handwritten note.  This is a letter which was sent from the Investigating Officer to the Commanding Officer of the Ballistics Section of the SAP.  Over time certain firearms were handed in by the ANC to the Police for ballistics testing, these were one of the first batches of guns that were handed in, and the reason that this is annexed is simply to show the two AK47s used on the day, they appear at page 16, paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2, \"AK47 aanvalsgewere X2\", those were the two AK47s that were used, one by Mr Molefe, one by Mr Khumalo.\n\tNow, paragraph 11 deals with the result of Superintendent Du Plessis's ballistic tests on exhibits, and I'm talking here about exhibits recovered at the scene on the day, the following day and exhibits recovered from the bodies.  What his analysis established was that a significant number of firearms were discharged at the time of the shooting.  \n\tChairperson, all the reference to Du Plessis's evidence are set out in footnotes, from footnote no 5 through to footnote no 15 and all of that evidence has been copied for the Committee and has been annexed as part of annexure \"H\".  I'm not going to go through that evidence, it was a cross-examination which I did of Superintendent Du Plessis where - and what I did was I took him through his two affidavits, the annexures B and C to this memorandum, told him that I had done a certain analysis of those affidavits, and asked him to confirm it.  He corrected me where I was wrong, and the result of that cross-examination, that analysis are set out in paragraph 11.1.  \n\tWhat it shows, Chairperson, 11.1 is that at least five and possibly six, maybe even more, AK47s were fired at the time of the main incident.  How do we know that?  Well, one of these AK47s was in fact later seized by the Police from a marcher at Library Gardens and positively linked to nine of the AK47 shells recovered at Shell House, the reference is there.  \n\tI asked how do we know this, you will see, Chairperson, if I could take you very briefly back to Superintendent Du Plessis's affidavit, page 9, page 9 of the bundle.  You will see there, paragraph 3.4, \"16 7.62 x 39 mm kaliber doppies\", 7.62 x 39 mm are AK47.  So there were 16 AK47 doppies and if you look at 3.14.1 on the same page, there was one 7.62 - one \"AK47 gemantelde koeel\", jacketed bullet which was found on the scene.  Now, where do I get the five, possibly six, possibly more from?  \tThe 16 doppies were analyzed as follows, 9 of the doppies were linked to the AK47 which was retrieved approximately 1 hour later by the Police from one of the marchers at Library Gardens, 9 of the doppies were linked to that AK47.  Six of the doppies were linked to the AK47 fired by Mr Molefe, handed in by the ANC before the 8th of July 1994 as per annexure \"D\", so 6 of the doppies were linked to one of those AK47s and we know that it was Mr Molefe's one because those doppies were picked up in De Villiers Street.  There was uncertainty as to where all the other exhibits were picked up, in fact nobody knows were they were picked up, but as far as the 16 AK47 doppies are concerned, there was a video which shows that they were picked up in De Villiers Street near the intersection with King George.  \n\tSo 9 Library Gardens AK, 6 Mr Molefe's AK and 1 left which couldn't possibly be linked to Mr Molefe's.  Superintendent Du Plessis said that he thought that it came from Mr Molefe's, but there was an absence of certain marks, he couldn't positively say that and he couldn't positively exclude the possibility that it was fired from another AK47.  \n\tThere was a bit of controversy in the evidence of Superintendent Du Plessis, and finally, it's actually not annexed here, I recall it now, but the following day he came back and it was clarified in his evidence that that last remaining doppie could have come from Mr Molefe's AK, it might not have and it could have come from another AK.  And that's the reference to possibly more, but if one takes that one out of account or even if one attributes that to Mr Molefe's AK, we have from the 16 doppies we have 2 AKs.  \n\tThen we know that Mr Khumalo fired an AK, that's the third AK.  Then we know that an AK was fired from above Nandos, that's the fourth AK, and then we know that one of the deceased was hit by an AK, the bullet was recovered, that's the fifth AK, analyzed by Superintendent Du Plessis and it wasn't linked either to Mr Khumalo nor to Mr Molefe.  I don't know if that sound terribly confusing, but we know that it was fired from another AK47, it could have been the AK above Nandos.",

            "Thank you, Chairperson.  We've made copies of the missing page 8, might I hand it up, hand some copies to my learned friends, thank you.  Chairperson, you will see that the one weapon that was found in the possession of the injured people, or amongst the people lying injured at Shell House is reflected there at paragraph 3.1 on the bottom of page 8, the self-loading pistol.\n\tI was dealing just before lunch with paragraph 11, and in 11.1, just to summarise briefly, the AK47s that were fired at the time of the shooting, according to the analysis of Superintendent Du Plessis were the one fired by Mr Molefe which was linked to the 6 doppies, the one fired by a marcher which is linked to the 9 doppies, that's the one that was later recovered at Library Gardens, the one AK47, that's no 3, fired into the deceased, probably fired from above Nandos.  \n\tThe fourth AK47 was the jacketed bullet found, the exhibit which wasn't linked to any of the others is no 4, and then of course Mr Eddie Khumalo's no 5, and then there's always the possibility of a sixth AK47 if one takes that last 16th doppie into account.  \n\tBesides AK47s that were fired at the time of the shooting, 11.2 and, the reference to the evidence is there, at least to Makorov pistols were fired, at least three revolvers were fired, possibly five revolvers were fired, at least five 9mm pistols were fired.  11.5, the R5 or R4 rifle, that's probably the one fired by the SADF person who shot at the marchers after he said the marchers shot at him with an AK47, one or more shotguns and then possibly many more firearms of different calibre and the evidence - it's dealt with in the evidence of Superintendent Du Plessis, the reference is there, footnote 13 and the page numbers are all annexed to the memorandum, but what he was referring to was that there were many bullet fragments as was set out in his affidavit which was recovered from the scene which couldn't be tested just because they weren't complete, there were I think about 20 bullet fragments of different calibre.  \n\tAnd then there were a whole lot of other jackets - doppies and bullets which were recovered, but which had not markings on, they couldn't be - he couldn't say one way or the other that it had come from the said gun or it did not come from the same gun, so there's that grey area.\n\tParagraph 12 then of the memorandum deals with other bullet fragments which had been found, and the significance that we say of the fact that fragments were found or bullets were found both on the eastern pavement and on the western pavement of Shell House is indicative of the fact that shots were being fired from all directions, and bullets were landing both on the eastern pavement and on the western pavement.  One can't take it any further than that.\n\tWhat is also interesting is paragraph 13, Chairperson, two of the exhibits which Superintendent Du Plessis tested, he positively linked to a Z88 9mm Parabellum pistol which was seized by the Police from one of the marchers later in the day, that's - and the reference is there as well.

Then I said,\n\"Superintendent, I have been given another copy, in paragraph 6.2 of your exhibit \"Y7\" you say the following\"\nand \"Y7\" for the Committee's purposes is annexure B if I'm not mistaken - yes, it's annexure B, annexure B is \"Y7\" and annexure C if there's any confusion was exhibit \"Y1\".

At page 22, at the top, paragraph 2, he says,\n\"Uit die statistiek blyk dit duidelik dat daar op 28 Maart '94 en voor die skietvoorval te Shell House verskeie voorvalle van geweld voorgekom het, veral te Soweto en Johannesburg.\"\nAnd then he goes on to detail the incidents and for the purposes of this memorandum the important paragraph is paragraph 3 where he says,\n\"Arrestasies op 28 Maart tydens die optogte Johannesburg, 31 persone is tydens die optog gearresteer vir die besit van ongelisensieerde vuurwapens en ammunisie.\"\nSo these were marchers.  \n\"'n Groot aantal vuurwapens is tydens die proses teruggevind\"\nand then I'm not going to read all of them, but you will see revolvers, shotguns and over the page, page 23, 9 AK47 guns seized and 123 rounds of AK47 ammunition, that's live ammunition seized, and then pistols, home-made revolvers and so on.  I can tell you, Chairperson, that the rest of this affidavit deals with investigations into MK members who came into the country from Zimbabwe, whether or not they were armed, he says his information was that they were not armed, I don't want to go into that detail because it's not particularly relevant, but just so that I'm not - I don't just gloss over it so you don't know what's here, and he says he doesn't have any evidence that they were involved in anything at Shell House.  \n\tHe then goes on to discuss certain conversations and meetings that he had with Caroline Nicholls and me on behalf of the ANC, and Jenny Friedman on behalf of the IFP, but none of that is of particular relevance.\n\tAnd then annexure G at page 28 is a Police report of an arrest on the 28th of March where further firearms were seized.

            "Mr Chairman, my position is identical to that of Mr Pretorius, there's a number of points I've already noted, but I would rather at an appropriate time address you more fully on all the points I would like to raise.\n\tMr Chairman, at this point in time I would like to place certain facts on record.  The matters had been curtailed somewhat by the withdrawal of the applications by two of the applicants at the time when they were to be called.  Earlier in the week I had certain discussions with Ms Patel with regard to who should be called and which witnesses should be subpoenaed.  At that point in time we did not foresee that we would need more than one or at most two witnesses to possibly give evidence in these proceedings.  \n\tWe then started to try and secure the presence of at least two such witnesses, we tried to secure the presence of Mr Diaz, that of Mr Stevens, that of Mr Potgieter, which I've already yesterday indicated we couldn't secure.  We thereafter also tried to secure the presence of Sergeant van Reenen.  Sergeant van Reenen is however of the opinion after he obtained some legal advice that he would like a formal subpoena, that he would like sufficient time to prepare, and that he's not prepared to give his evidence at this point in time.  Earlier this week when we didn't sit because of one of the learned Commissioners not being available, we had a meeting amongst the legal teams of the objectors and we at that point in time decided that the witnesses that could now called, should first of all be the independent witnesses who has got no specific interest to either one of the parties involved and that's why we endeavoured to try and get hold of these witnesses.  \n\tAt this point in time as far as the objectors are concerned, the individual objectors who we envisage we might call are but a few in number.  The position with their evidence is that they are not going to be of much assistance to this Committee with regard to putting a proper picture before the Committee as to what happened.  They're unsophisticated and uneducated people and we decided amongst the legal teams appearing on behalf of the objectors that we want to first call the independent witnesses to place that picture before the Committee to give the globular picture before individuals are being called as objectors who can't give a full perspective of what happened.",

They're going to give an account of what they did, where they were at the time and so on, how they were attacked and why that happened.

The ballistical evidence concerned the fragments, and the fragments ballistically could not positively be connected to a specific AK47, but that does not exclude either of the two AK47s.
