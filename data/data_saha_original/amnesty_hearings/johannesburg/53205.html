<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Mr Plaatjies, you are before this Committee to apply for amnesty for the acts which you committed on 15th January 1993 and at Westbury, Johannesburg, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Is it further correct that you are now serving a term of imprisonment at Medium C, Johannesburg Prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Before your arrest and your sentence where were you residing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Westbury.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> And before and during the commission of the said offences, to which political party did you belong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> African National Congress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> What was the position that you held within the branch within the African National Congress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> An active member, an active supporter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> And what experience did you encounter during your active participation as a supporter and member of the African National Congress at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> During the 1990's, the National Party, most of the white guys, they terrorised us, detained us, tortured us and so on and the end of that I became tired of them.  I started to join up with Mr Marx and Ashley Bashing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Just hold on, who was this Mr Ashley you are talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> He told me he was an MK of the ANC and Mr Marx was his senior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Then what did you do from then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> During that time of the period I started arranging illegal firearms because I see that the policemen were terrorising us, we armed ourselves as we were smuggling illegal firearms with some comrades from ...[indistinct]</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> When you arranged these illegal firearms, on which instructions did you act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> On behalf of Ashley Bashing and Mr Marx.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> So you acted if I understand you correctly, you acted on instructions from Ashley Bashing and Mr Marx?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> To which political parties did they belong or which position did they hold within that political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> It was from the African National Congress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Now proceed from ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which position, what position did they hold within the African National Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> As I knew Mr Ashley Bashing was under Mr Marx, I couldn't say because he was just an MK member he told me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But when you purported to act under their instructions what position did they hold?  Did you just take instructions because they were members of the African National Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes as I said he ordered me as an MK so I obeyed his orders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he belong to any particular structure that you would have at least considered appropriate for you to take instructions from Mr Marx and Bashing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Because I couldn't say which structure he was under because that time I knew he was working, operating with people from Soweto, Mr Bashing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you yourself belong to any particular structure within the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> As I said I was just an active supporter and member of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So when you say you were under instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> That's right Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I do not understand what you mean.  You would be under instructions from a commander or from a superior that you believed you had a duty to take instructions from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Mr Chair that time we were not actually involved like going for training and all those things, we were just doing it like generally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes I never went for it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed Mr Leopeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> So in other words you say you acted on instructions from Mr Ashley Bashing irrespective of whether you satisfied yourself was a commander of a particular structure, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Now what activities did you do as you were acting on instructions from Mr Bashing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> During that time I was involved in gun running, I was involved in gun running.  At a time when I was involved in gun running ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Hold on, were you involved in gun running?  How were you involved in gun running?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> We were arming ourselves because for the operation SAP or security branch police and National Party, the white dominium oppressed us, harassed us, that's how we got involved because we were sick and tired ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Plaatjies, how do you understand gun running?  You used the term gun running, what do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> We used to go to Soweto from Meadowlands, we organised firearms, we brought in the arms ourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes well how many firearms did you organise in this way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Could remember that it was not more than three times because ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I'm not asking you how many times you went to Meadowlands, I'm saying how many firearms did you organise in this way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Sometimes it was AK47's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> How many Mr Plaatjies, I'm not interested in sometimes this and sometimes that.  Give me a rough estimate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I would say it was about more than 12.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> More than 12 firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And what did you do with the firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> At the end of the day we armed ourselves, the others went to Ashley Bashing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Who was ourselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> It was me, Ashley Bashing, some other comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well, give us some names please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> It was Rashied Meyerus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Ja?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Elton Johnson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Is that it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes I couldn't remember because we were involved with other guys from Soweto also, I couldn't remember their names, just nicknames.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Where did you get these arms from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> We used to have some comrades there from Meadowlands by the name of Slovo and the one with Chris Mandela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> I don't understand now, if you were supposed to get arms for the ANC, did you get arms from ANC members to give to ANC members?  That's not gun running?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> That's the way we used to take it, Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> You were not in a structure of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Can you just come again with the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> I mean you were not in a particular structure, you told us that you were not in a particular structure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> As I said we were just obeying the orders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Okay and you say you were gun running, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> That's what because we were involved in the firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And now you tell us that you got firearms from ANC members to take to other ANC members, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And you call that gun running?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> At the end of the day it's going hand to hand because I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Okay, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks Mr Leopeng, sorry to interrupt in your leading of the witness.</p>

<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Please just repeat what you're saying, you're speaking a bit indistinctly I'm afraid and I can't follow what you're saying.  You said that Ashley told you some security policemen were looking for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And this was in connection with the gun running?</p>

<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And then you said something and I didn't hear exactly what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Shortly after that he told me it was two Indian guys, shortly after that two Indians approached me near my house, then we started doubting them with some others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How shortly, what do you mean by saying shortly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I couldn't remember, it was in that week.</p>

<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Was Mr Ashley Bashing aware that you abducted these people or before that was he aware that you were going to abduct these people.</p>

<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How was he aware that you were going to abduct these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Because that night he left with Mr Marx and Mr Robbie Petersen.</p>

<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't understand what you are saying.  What pointing out did you allude to in your evidence before I asked this question?  Didn't you say something about him having pointed out the Indians that you abducted?</p>

<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He did point out what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Some Indian guys, as he said those Indians are the security police but I'm not sure what date it could be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And where were you when he did the pointing out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> We were in the ...[indistinct] vicinity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And how far were these persons from where you two were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> It's more or less by the robot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And are they the same persons that you subsequently abducted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just before you do, there was one issue you raised, I just don't want to lose it.  You said something about before you abducted them there was something about instructions and I couldn't hear what you were saying.  Just repeat that please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> The people who were with me I gave them the instructions, Neville Williams, those guys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So you gave ordinary members of the community instructions to help you abduct these two people, do I understand that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> How was your relationship with these people that you gave instruction to assist you with abducting the two Indian chaps?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well Neville Williams, Phillip Stevens, I just know them by seeing about.  Tony Naidoo, I think he was one of the friends of Neville Williams or Phillip Stevens but otherwise Hendrick Christian I know him from school days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Were all these people that you mentioned also the members of the African National Congress at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes it's possible because now and then I wasn't always with them you see, if they wasn't they wouldn't have been with me at that time, they wouldn't have followed the instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, say that again?  Did I hear you correctly, did you say if they weren't members of the ANC they wouldn't have followed your instructions, is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> That is, that's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And that's why you assumed they were ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes because at the end of the day I can't speak for them at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well you have to speak for yourself and that's why you're here and that's why we're asking these questions, trying to understand your evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Wasn't your evidence that you gave instructions in their capacity of local members of the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, which is something different to which you are now agreeing to, that you gave them instructions because they could have been members of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> At the end of the day Mrs Chair, the way we were operating there and people are maybe involved in something, the people just get involved also at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, so it wouldn't have mattered whether they were members of the ANC or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well that's why it's hard for me to say, that's why I stated in my application they were locals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes that's your evidence, that's your vive voce evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Let's start from where you are abducting them, then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> We tortured them.  After we abducted them we tortured them, they didn't want to talk.  I gave Hendrick Christian the firearm, he shot one of the Indians in the leg.  We were asking them were they policemen, they denied.  After that we take them to the open veld near the railway line.  Then I was in possession of a firearm, I then shot the both of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Why did you shoot at both of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Can you just come again Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Why did you shoot at both of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> At the end of the day the reason why I shot them, I wanted to send a message out very clear to the security branch they must stop harassing us and that we are serious, they must stay away from us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How would the security branch have known about your action and the subsequent killing of the alleged Indian security policemen?  How would they have known that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> As I said Mr Chair, the information I had, those Indian guys were from the security branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes but how would the security branch have known that the alleged Indian security policemen had been killed because of their activities within the security police.  How would they have known that?  What measures did you take to ensure that that message was understood loud and clear by the security branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> At the end of the day Mr Chair I think it was for them to think if such an act happened like that in the location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Come again?  I didn't get your response properly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I think at that time it was clear from the end of the day they knew we were operating because we were liberating Westbury from the oppression.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They knew that you were operating?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> We was busy liberating Westbury from the oppression.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How were you doing that, had you committed something similar to what you had done to these Indian police, alleged Indian policemen, before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> You see, way back the National Party used to use also the gangs to commit violence acts against us, all those things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, how would they have known that this particular killing was meant to send a clear message that you are now sick and tired of their operations within you.  How would the security branch have known that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I can't answer that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  You may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> So in other words Mr Plaatjies, if I understand you correctly, you say the reason why you abducted the alleged two Indian policemen and you subsequently shot and killed one is that you wanted to send a message to other members of the security forces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> But if I can take the question of Madame Chair further, how would you have achieved your objective in sending a message to other members of the security forces that you were chipped off or you were sick and tired of the activities of the security forces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well I was sick and tired of the security forces and liberating operation and to set free the people of the coloured township, Westbury.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You haven't responded to his question.  Won't you please repeat your question Mr Leopeng and make sure that he understands it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Mr Plaatjies, my question is very simple.  I'm saying objective did you want to achieve in abducting and killing the two alleged Indian police officials?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Leopeng, that's not your question.  Your question is how would he achieve his stated purpose of sending a clear message.  In other words, how would that message be communicated to the people he was seeking to reach, to impress upon them that he was making an example of their members.  How did he think that they would get the message, that it was his people that were saying we are sick and tired etcetera.  Do you understand that Mr Plaatjies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Try and explain that to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But again I don't know Mr Leopeng, it is within your instruction that you would have been able to get that message across and if it is within your instructions how that message would have been carried across to the security branch.  Your client has just a few seconds ago considered that that question is not something that he can be able to respond to but you have now again repeated my question.  I don't know whether you will be able to elicit some information that I have not been able to because his response to that question when I put it to him was that he was unable to respond to it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>I don't know whether you can take it any further.  You will be informed obviously by the instructions you obtained from Mr Plaatjies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> For the purpose of the evidence I will abandon the question but for the purpose of the record, the question was discussed in detail with the applicant during the consultation.  So for the purpose of this then I will abandon the question and then proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Don't abandon, I mean if it is within your instructions then you are personally aware that it is a question that he can be able to answer.  Proceed to put it to him in a manner that you know will be able to elicit the kind of response you want from him.  Don't abandon the question, it is a very important question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Mr Plaatjies, now I'll deal with the question that came across.  What message, how were you going to send a message to other police officials in the community Westbury, after abducting and killing the two alleged Indian police officials?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well as I said the message was clear.  I don't know how to explain it but as I can explain in this way, all because of liberating Westbury of the oppression, to set the people of Westbury free from the white National Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Let me try and help you here.  How would the police know that this just wasn't an ordinary criminal act, that somehow their members were just hijacked or some other kind of thing?  How would the police be able to differentiate between the fact this might have been a criminal act as opposed to a political act with a stated political objective of informing them something?  Do you see the distinction we are trying to understand from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I mean you're just assuming that because on your version this was an act of a political group therefore the police would understand it was aimed at them and what we're saying to you is how did you ensure that this is what they understood as opposed to something else that it might have been, like a random criminal act?  Do you see the distinction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Please explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> At the end of the day we are not involved in an active criminal acts because most of my cases I never was involved in any criminal act so I think there were some policemen who knew about me there in the location, there in Westbury vicinity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> How would they know it was you, that's the whole point as opposed to some other criminal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> That question I can't answer Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it your intention to publicise this killing in order for the policemen who knew you around your area to be connected to the ANC to connect the killing of the two alleged Indian security policemen to the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes it was my intention to publicise that Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes and how did you intend to publicise it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> By the way the execution was done Mr Chair, where they were shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But how would it come to the attention of the local policemen who knew you to be an ANC member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> That Mr Chair as we were arrested also it was - you can come from there at the end of the day how we were arrested also, from the rest of our cases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No I don't know how you were arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> One of my co-accused he was arrested in Newlands police station.  At the end he spilt the whole beans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But was it your intention to go out publicly and say "we have done it in the name of the ANC because the people are security policemen"?  Was it your intention to do that?  If it was your intention to do that, what is it that you did then in order to do precisely that, publicising the fact the killing was politically related?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well Mrs Chair as I said I don't think now anyone will go sommer out public.  He will go out public but at the end of the day he will still be underground because he don't want them to be involved in a case, at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You know you are giving - you are contrasting two things.  It's possible for someone to go public but at the end of the day you still have to do something underground.  I do not understand that aspect of your evidence.  What measures did you take, if you did take any measures, to ensure that your stated objective of sending a clear message to the security branch that the killing had been committed by you in your capacity as an ANC member to stop the harassment, the intimidation and the torture that they were causing to the members of your community.  What measures did you take to  ensure that your stated objective was made aware or brought to the security branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> The answer to the question, the way they were tortured, the way they were abducted and the way they were shot, Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How would that be different from anyone committing a criminal act?  How would the way they were tortured and indeed they were severely tortured, the killing was gruesome.  Now how would that gruesome killing, the terrible torture they were subjected to be different from an act that would be committed by a criminal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> At the end of the day Mrs Chair, the reason why they were so severely injured was because we were trying to get information out of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are not responding to my question.  How would the way they were tortured and how would the way one of them was ultimately killed be different from a torture or killing by an ordinary criminal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Then Mrs Chair we can go back that time, it was like a war that time, you couldn't resist anything, you just had to carry out the order you was given, it was war that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you able to respond to my question or are you not able to respond to my question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I think I'm not able to respond to that question Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I will note that you are unable to respond to my question again.  You may proceed Mr Leopeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> One other question subject to the Committee's approval, I'm not sure if this question has been questioned before.  Mr Plaatjies, if I understand you correctly you say the reason, the main reason why you abducted the two Indian policemen, alleged policemen, and subsequently killed one, is that they were investigating you for gun running or that they were police officials belonging to the security branch at Westbury?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.  It was involved with the police, security police and running ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Leopeng, I don't understand the question, you just put to Mr Plaatjies.  There is no evidence that these people were investigating him for gun running.  He has not testified to that kind of evidence, has he?  I am corrected that he has, I have not made any notes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Madame Chair, the evidence which was before is that he was informed by Ashley Bashing that there are two Indian police officials who were interested in him for the gun running, that was the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> So the question is was that the main reason why he abducted them acting on the information of Mr Bashing and subsequently killed one of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I'm sorry about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Leopeng, it's not over yet.  There's no evidence to say these policemen came from Westbury and they were based at Westbury.  That's what you're putting to him.  They may be security policemen, we don't know where they were from at this stage so just be careful how you put your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr Leopeng, before you proceed, may I just enquire from the applicant.  Mr Plaatjies, are you Afrikaans or English speaking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I'm Afrikaans Mrs Bosman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Would you follow the questions better if they were translated to you into Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> As I said I'll try my best in English, Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Plaatjies, it is your right to speak in a language that you are comfortable in, that you will be able to express yourself better so if you want to speak in Afrikaans we have translators who will be able to translate whatever you say into different languages, in English, in Zulu, in Sotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I think I'm comfortable in English, Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you feel so then you may proceed to give your evidence in English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Thanks Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Leopeng, you may rephrase your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Mr Plaatjies, are you saying that the reason, main reason why you abducted and subsequently killed one of the alleged two Indian police officials is that you had been informed by Bashing that they were investigating you for the gun running?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> The information I got from Ashley Bashing was just only they were investigating us, investigating me, he then told me about gun running so it's obvious it could be the gun running, it could be political activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> But in your evidence in chief you told this Committee that the reason why they were investigating you is that of your activities in gun running?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> It's on record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes it's possible they could be investigating me of gun running and my activities I was involved at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Is there any other thing that you wish to tell this  Committee on your activities and an explanation of your acts committed on victims you were ordered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> On that day after we abducted, we tortured, we abducting them, we tortured them, we shot them, we went to their car, we burnt it out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> What was the reason to burn out their car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Then we will put a reason to burn out a car it was to leave no evidence behind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> To leave no evidence behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> So ultimately did you achieve your political motive in killing one of the two Indian policemen who were shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes I could say like that, I did achieve my political points.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What political objective Mr Leopeng are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> That they were harassed, tortured by the security forces at Westbury.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> That's not an objective, that is a context.  What was his objective, that's what the Chair is asking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> May I put the question to the applicant, what was their political motive that he wanted to achieve?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't want to tell you what questions to put, I just did not understand what you meant by the political objective because we have not been given any particulars about the political objectives that Mr Plaatjies sought to achieve specifically by committing the offences for which he is seeking amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> I wish to put the question to the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>	What political motive did you want to achieve in ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think there's a difference between a political motive and a political objective but what we are trying to ascertain from him is what political objective was sought to be achieved by him in committing the offences for which he seeks amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think you must be very specific, you must speak of the objective and not the motive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> What was your political objective.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> It was to save Westbury, the coloured community, free from the oppression from the police and to continue with our political organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Was that all that you wanted to achieve?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Is there anything that you wish to tell the Committee on your ...[indistinct] acts that you committed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well I would ask the Commission to take my application into consideration and to the victims and their family I'm asking for forgiveness, I know it's hard for them to forgive me but I'm asking forgiveness today.  That's all I can say.  I'm sorry what happened on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whilst you are leading him in his evidence in chief Mr Leopeng, shouldn't you for the sake of completeness of his evidence in chief deal with the issue of robbery to which he has alluded in his application form on page 212?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Yes Mr Plaatjies in your application for amnesty more so on page 212 you said the robbery of their jewellery was a mistake which you did not order and did not apply for amnesty.  What do you say about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> At the end of the day that wasn't the reason why I do not apply amnesty for it Mrs Chair, that wasn't part of the order I was given to and at the end of the day I never robbed anyone Mrs Chair.  The watch was handed over to me by a co-accused by the name of Tony Naidoo, the one who was discharged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What items are to your knowledge involved in this crime of robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Mrs Chair, on the day when they took the items out there was a watch and a bracelet, it was sold to someone at a shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> It was actually two watches, that's why at the end of the day if Mrs Chair can look nicely, the watch was handed, it wasn't also sold to the same person because at the end of the day the watch was handed over to me because the watch and a bracelet was sold to some other guy.  It was two watches and one bracelet but in that possession I was only handed over one watch and I'm asking forgiveness for those things that happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you kept the watch is it not so?  When you were arrested it was found in your possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes Mrs Chair, the watch was handed to me on a Friday, on the Saturday I went to a funeral so I didn't have much time to go back home because that same Saturday I was with Ashley Bashing but when he talk about a watch he told me also it wasn't part of the deal so that's why my application I stated it was a mistake and I'm very sorry about what happened about the watch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you accept the watch when it was given to you when you knew that it was not to be part of the offence for which you were to commit on the two alleged security policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> As I said Mr Chair, it's after we burned the car, the car was already set on fire.  As I said in my application it was a mistake, I'm sorry for accepting the watch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I know you say it was a mistake, I'm saying why did you accept the watch when it was given to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Just to keep because I didn't want the guys to feel bad and at the end of the day I told them the time when I was accepting the watch, I told them it wasn't part of the order I was given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why would you not want them to feel bad about something that did not form part of your instructions, were you not a disciplined lot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes I was disciplined Mrs Chair but at the end of the day there was nothing I could have done, I just took the watch, that's why I say it was a mistake, I felt bad also after I took it Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was nothing that you could have done but to take the watch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes I felt bad that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Couldn't you refuse taking that watch knowing that it was not part of what you had to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes I could have refused it Mrs Chair but at the end of the day the point still comes I had took it, that's why I'm asking in my amnesty it was a mistake, I felt bad after I took it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know that credit cards were also removed from the alleged Indian security policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> That I heard in court but I never removed any credit cards, me myself that even, that day.  I never removed any cards, I heard it in court when they arrested us, charged us with cards involved.  I never took any cards, I never see any cards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you not present at all material times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I was present.  Look, Mrs Chair, that evening, that day I was busy assaulting and torture those people, people who were torturing them, those guys at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you not like a commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Look Mrs Chair, that day it was - we just panicked that - it was like a panic that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you not the commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes I was in charge but I couldn't say do what or who did what.  For example look like the watches Mrs Chair, I never saw they took any watches at that day.  Only after we burned out the car we found out people were robbed of their jewellery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Leopeng, you may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> ...[inaudible] the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes Mr Leopeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> This is the evidence of the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR LEOPENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Leopeng.  Ms Thabete do you have any questions to put to Mr Plaatjies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETE:</span> Yes Madame Chair, thank you.  Mr Plaatjies, you say you were given instructions by Mr Bashing.  Exactly what were the instructions given to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> The instructions was to eliminate those two Indians and get rid of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Maybe you can clarify something for you, in your affidavit you say after being informed that the two Indian security policemen, it's on page 3, paragraph 3.6.  You say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>"After being informed that the two Indian security policemen are looking for me, I took an initiative to eliminate them."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes that was the order ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> I haven't asked the question.  My question is why didn't you specify here that Ashley actually told you to eliminate them, why do you say you took an initiative to eliminate them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well maybe I was just in a hurry to write the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now we are talking about a supplementary affidavit that has been handed up by your lawyer after consultation with you which affidavit I must state accords with the evidence contained in your application form on page 213 wherein you say you were "tipped off" by Ashley and you do not suggest that he instructed you.  Now we have your supplementary affidavit and we also have your application form.  In both documents you do not suggest that you were instructed to do anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Mrs Chair at the end of the day I would say I was instructed because at the end of the day I wouldn't haven't tell him if I wasn't instructed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I know that, what Ms Thabete wants you to explain is how did you come to say something else and in your vive voce evidence you say something completely different?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Mrs Chair ...[indistinct]</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, she has referred you to that affidavit and in particular to paragraph 3.6 on page 3.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Then Mrs Chair I think I was just maybe in a hurry to write the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you aware we are talking about a supplementary affidavit that was prepared by you with the assistance of a lawyer?  How can you be in a hurry to do something when you are coming to a Committee to disclose your participation about an offence for which you are seeking amnesty.  How can you be in a hurry to do something and in the process you say something which did not happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well Mrs Chair this morning the advocate only handed me only this morning this affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying that affidavit was not prepared in consultation with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> He only consulted this morning Mrs Chair, this morning we have consultation, it wasn't even long.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So what is reflected in that affidavit is not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I couldn't say Mrs Chair because right now where I am I am a bit confused also now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now let's forget about the affidavit which you say - now, yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> I just want to come in here.  In his application he actually says"</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>"Ashley tipped me off about the two Indian security that were investigating us and that they should be eliminated"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>but in the supplementary affidavits - and then he says he took an initiative to do this but in the supplementary affidavit it doesn't say anything about Ashley having given the instructions to eliminate them.  So I wanted him to clarify that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Here by 3.6 it said "after being informed"</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Yes, you were not instructed, you were just informed, the two policemen were looking for you and then you say you took initiative to eliminate them, you don't say you were given instructions to eliminate them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes if we can closer at the end of the day I didn't draw up this affidavit at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Wasn't it read to you before you ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> It was only this morning given to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> But it was read to you, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Why didn't you identify that fault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I'm sorry about it Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> I mean it's an important factor because you're saying here, what you're saying here is that you did it on your own, no one gave you instructions to do it?  It's not just a misprint or whatever, it's a ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well at the end of the day I was given an instruction to get rid of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just to take that issue further you are saying you were given an instruction by Ashley?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes it was an order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And if Ashley had not given you that instruction you wouldn't have killed, you wouldn't have committed the acts you did, that is killing one person and severely injuring the other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> That's right Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If that is so, how then does it become your stated objective to send a message to the security branch about the fact that you can no longer tolerate the harassment and the intimidation they were subjecting the members of your community to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well Mrs Chair, as I said that was my message I wanted to get through.  I don't know how would the cops have taken it, that was my message I tried to get through at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you also wanted to commit the act because you as Mr Plaatjies wanted to send this message to the security branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that message couldn't have been as a result of the instructions you got from Mr Bashing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well Mrs Chair at the end of the day I was a foot soldier of Mr Bashing so at the end of the day I would have listened, I wouldn't have gone out of my own way and just go and planned anything without any order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You keep on telling us at the end of the day this would have happened, this wouldn't have happened.  I just want to know how if it was your own stated objective to send a clear message to the security branch to stop the harassment and the intimidation, the subjecting your community to.  How can that happen if that never was your own intention to kill?  How can you have a stated objective which really didn't emanate from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> At the end of the day as I say Mrs Chair as I said earlier on it was nothing that I could have done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed Ms Thabete.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Thank you Madame Chair.  Mr Plaatjies you also say that when Ashley Bashing informed you about the policemen who were investigating you, he did not point them out to you.  On what basis then did you target these two men who were driving in an Uno?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> At the end of the day there's in our community not sommer actually you get Indians in our vicinity, most of this is coloured area.  During that time I just target, we just abducted them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> So I don't know whether I'm hearing correctly are you saying ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, I just didn't hear the first part of your answer?  You just something them and then you abducted them, what did you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I said in our community ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, no I heard that but the last part of your answer was you said Indians weren't common in your community, then you said I just something them and then we abduct them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> The day when they approach us, we abducted them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Before that you said something about "I just" something "them and then we abduct them" that was your reply.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Maybe it was just a slip of the tongue Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Mr Plaatjies are you saying you identified them on the basis that they were Indian?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes and Ashley Bashing as I said, during that week, they were pointed also out, wouldn't just remember as I said in my chief ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> No, in your evidence you specifically said and clearly said</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>	"Ashley Bashing did not point them out to me."</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry Ms Thabete, it's the other way around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Thanks, I stand to be corrected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>	You've also said in your evidence that you were present at all material times when the incident took place, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> And you say you were the commander or you instructed the other guys to carry out the whole robbery and whatever happened that day, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I couldn't say I instructed them for the robbery because it was not my intention, it was not part of the deal or the order to rob those guys so if any other torturing ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> My question to you is that if you were the instructor and you had the political objective and these were just people from your area, why didn't you say anything, why didn't you reprimand them when you saw them robbing, robbing of the watches and all that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> As I said earlier on in my evidence there wasn't time to see people get robbed as Mrs Chairman also asked me about the credit cards, there was no time to look because I was busy assaulting those guys at the end of the day.  I didn't - my eyes - because we were panicking that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> No but isn't it correct that you actually got into the car of Mr Makanjee and Padajachee and that you were seated in front, isn't that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes you must - as I said the investigators at one time, when I get out and went and fetch hangers ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> I don't understand your evidence.  How could you not have seen, I mean you were sitting in front, how could you have not seen when they were out of their watching ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Ms Thabete, let him finish, he's trying to explain.  There was a point where he got out of the car to get hangers.  Just finish your evidence Mr Plaatjies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes Mr Chair, there was a time when I get out, it's possible it could be that time or the time we were robbed because when I came back I was asking that the co-accused, Henry Christian, did he said anything yet?  He said no.  After that we went and shot them.  It was at the scene of the crime we will tighten those guys with hangers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> According to the evidence in court that was led by Mr Makajee, Makanjee or whatever, you were seated in front of that car, it's on page 12 - 21.  The car stopped and you forced the people out of the car and then it's at that time that you took possession of the bank cards and the watches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Mrs Chair if you can ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> It was before you actually went to the house of the lady to ask for coat hangers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> If I could remember carefully on that day in court I had a bandage on my hand.  I was busy assaulting them.  I think in chief evidence Mr Makanjee said the one with a bandage was hitting from behind.  I had an operation here on my hand.  If you can go clearly to my evidence, he said the one with the bandage on his hand, I was the one who was assaulting them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> I'm not disputing that Mr Plaatjies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Plaatjies, just listen to the question before you start arguing with the evidence leader.  Do you understand, she hasn't even finished putting the question to you and you're already trying to answer.  Please just listen carefully, in that way you'll understand the issue better.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Okay Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Mr Plaatjies, I'm not disputing the fact that you assaulted them, but what I'm saying to you is that evidence was led in court that you actually took, robbed them of their watches and their bank cards before you assaulted them and before you used the coat hangers to tie them.  So it's not possible - I put it to you, it's not possible that you could not have been there when the watches were taken because this happened before you actually stopped and got out of the car to get the coat hangers to tie them up?  Can you explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well Mrs Chair it's impossible because that time no one was robbed yet, even me, I was surprised when after we burned out the car because as you said, you said in chief evidence I was sitting in the front but at the end of the day the one with the bandage was sitting at behind, is in chief evidence, was hitting him.  The one with the bandage around his hand.  I was sitting at the back, I never sat in the front Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> But you agreed that you sat in front of the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I never sat in the front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Is it not also correct that you stopped and you tried to extract cash from the various bank outlets with the cards that you had taken from them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I don't remember about any stopping at any banks that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know or don't you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I don't know about any cards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's not something that you can forget.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> No I don't remember about cards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did that happen or that did not happen?  It's not something that you can forget?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well Mrs Chair as I said if I could have remembered I will tell Mrs Chair as I only heard all those evidence in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying that did not happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> It did not happen at that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I request you to address me as Madame Chair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> When these men approached your house or when these men went past your house, did you know they were policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> As I said there's no Indians always in our community and during that week ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> No, I'm asking did you know they were policemen.  I know you knew they were Indians.  I'm asking did you know they were policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> No I was just acting, I was just panicking that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just answer a simple yes or no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> No I didn't - I took the initiative they were policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did you know that they were policemen, yes or no, plain and simple?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I thought they were but at the end of the day ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You didn't know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So just say no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> So on what basis did you attack them if you didn't know they were policemen with regard to the political objective that you've stated in your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> As I've said the reason why I answer it ...[indistinct] at court, I was told those guys were not from the security branch that's why I responded to that question like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On what basis did you proceed to abduct them if you did not know that they were policemen, that is the question put to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I understand the question wrong Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>But that day when I abducted them I was sure they were policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have just said you did not know that they were policemen when they approached your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well Madame Chair as I said also now in my evidence I said I only heard those things in court that's why I respond to that question like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> May I just enquire from you Mr Plaatjies, I'm sorry to interrupt you, if you established in court that they were not policemen, why did you in your affidavit still refer to them as Indian security policemen?  If you look for an example on page 3 of your affidavit, 3.8:  "then these two Indian security policemen confronted me."  Why are you ...[inaudible] affidavit that they are policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well that what's happening on that day on that specific day, you can't talk about after court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you.  Proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> So what are you saying Mr Plaatjies, are you saying you did not know they were policemen or are you saying you did know that they were policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> The night of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> When they went past your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I did think they were policemen that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> You thought they were policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Ja they probably were policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Why did you think that they were policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Because I had the information that they were Indians.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> So to you Indians are policemen, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes it's possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> So when you see an Indian it's the same thing as if you are seeing a policeman, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> As I said in my - it's not easy to see an Indian there in Westbury.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But why would on this occasion when seeing these two Indian men think that they were policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Mrs Chair that day I just panicked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You keep on referring to your state of mind as being that of panicking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you have to panic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> If it were policemen maybe my life would also be in danger that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You didn't know, you actually saw two Indian persons, what made you to panic when seeing two Indian persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Because the information I had that the Indians were looking for me, Mrs Chair - Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But it was not just any other Indian, the information was that two Indian policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> As I said I just get an order what I was supposed to do Mrs Chair, Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I also still do not understand this aspect of your evidence which seems to contradict with what you've previously stated.  You said these men were identified by Ashley, Ashley pointed them out to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes that same - during the week.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So why should you not be in a position to know whether they are the same persons that had previously been identified to you by Ashley?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> As I said earlier Mrs Chair it was about at night that time before 8 o'clock, those things happened, it was already about dark and that day those people when they were pointed out it was during the day Mrs Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes but then ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> But at night you couldn't see but you could see it was Indians but at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you had information about how these people looked like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now when you abducted them you say you didn't know whether they were the same persons that had been identified to you by Ashley?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Madame Chair as I've said things happened so fast that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But then when you tortured them you must have been very close to them, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> As ...[indistinct] Mrs Chair, I don't think while we were torturing they were denying ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> They were from the security branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh, don't preempt my question, I haven't finished my question.  When you tortured them you must have been close, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> We may have been close Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> And it were the same people that Ashley - is Madame Chair trying to ask me if those were the same people Ashley were point out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why have you not said that in your evidence in chief and when questions were being put to you by Ms Thabete?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Maybe I'm a bit confused Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why should you be confused when you are giving evidence about an incident that happened, that you have had an occasion to reflect upon because you know you have to come and give evidence before this Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well I think Mrs Chair anyone who is coming here is a bit worried, things like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Worried about what?  All you have to do is to tell the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes and that's why I'm here today to tell the truth Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So why should your evidence be confused and therefore incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well Mrs Chair at the end of the day Mrs Chair can also take into account where I'm sitting today without a cent and it's a bit difficult, psychologically I'm confused Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Proceed Ms Thabete.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Thank you Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>	You say you were just a supporter of the ANC.  Were you a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> You were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Do you have a card?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well at the moment I can't get any card because I'm in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At the time in question did you have a card, were you a card carrying member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes I had a card but I lost my card.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Under what branch were you working in Westbury, do you have a branch in Westbury?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> At that time there was no branch in Westbury.  Mr Ashley Bashing made me a card because in 1993 there was no branch.  I heard late 94/95 they had a branch there.  During that time there wasn't any branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Anyway my question is you were just a supporter and member of the ANC.  What authority did you have to give instructions to other people to commit these acts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> And I will say that time is a time I'll go, there's nothing I could have done, it was an order I get from Mr Ashley Bashing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> No, I'm saying you also instructed, he gave a further instruction, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> I'm asking you what authority did you have to give such further instructions as just a member and supporter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well Mrs Chair I think that time there was nothing I could have done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why are you saying there's nothing you could have done when the question is so simple.  What authority did you have to give instructions to members of the community to carry out something that had been issued to you in your capacity as an ANC member and your evidence, may I remind you, was that these were ordinary locals, not necessarily ANC supporters or members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> At the end of the day Mrs Chair the order was given to me so it's always that I should have some manpower that's why I used those guys for manpower to assist me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you have a unit in your area when you talk of manpower?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> No maybe Madame Chair is understanding me wrong, I just used those guys to help me that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you were given an order by Ashley ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you discuss with Ashley that you did not have people that can assist you in order to execute the order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> It wasn't any discussions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you not do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Because the same day, most of that time Ashley and Mr Marx they were busy, I don't know what they were busy with, other staff, I don't know which staff they were busy Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But now after that date you did not have an occasion to speak further to Ashley, this was an important order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I know Madame Chair because I didn't have any chance to talk because I only met Ashley again on the Saturday morning and we attend a funeral.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Proceed Ms Thabete?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Maybe I should make a follow up question on that aspect.  Did Ashley give you reasons why these men or Indian men had to be eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well you know sometimes you just call it like ...[indistinct] language, they were busy there, at the end of the day he was just giving the information, he didn't told me because I could just take note because of my activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The question was did he give you a reason why they should be eliminated?  It's a very straightforward question.  Do you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Why did - what reason did he give you, did he give you a reason, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well at the end of the day ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just answer the question, did he give you a reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes he gave me a reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Right, what reason was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> It's actually in connection with the gun running and the activities we were involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So what do you mean in connection with, why was that a problem that they should be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> At the end of the day there's nothing I could have done, because they were from the security branch, on the other side we were arming ourself for the security branch also at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes but you're involved in gun running?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> These people are investigating your activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now how is killing them going to stop anyone else investigating your activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> That question also came to me earlier on, it would be difficult to say because at the end of the day I wanted to send the message.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So it wasn't Ashley's decision, it was your decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> It came from Ashley I shouldn't have shot them if it wasn't a decision from Ashley.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well you've never told us that Ashley wanted to send a message, you've said you wanted to send the message.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> As I said it was an order, I didn't mean that Ashley wanted ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No, no, we're just going round in circles.  Carry on Ms Thabete?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Earlier on in your evidence you also said that you abducted these two men because you wanted to question them, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes it's ...[indistinct]</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> What did you want to question them about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Why they were looking for me, for which branch they are working for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> But you already knew they were looking for you, they were investigating your gun running?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes and what do they want from me and that's why I said in my application we tortured them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> No, you already knew they were investigating you or allegedly investigating you because you were involved in gun running.  What other information did you want from them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well I want to know the truth, what they want actually from us, the real story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But wasn't that the truth Mr Plaatjies?  You already knew the details of the investigation, what more did you hope to get from them.  You knew, you believed that you were being investigated for gun running, you never doubted that was the reason why you were being investigated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So what more did you expect to extract from them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well as I said as we were torturing them it came out Madame Chair they denied they were policemen also so it was difficult for us that's why we abducted them because they denied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> But they didn't deny they were not policemen, didn't you say you heard in court they were not policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes in court I heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> So they were telling the truth, they were not policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes, they were telling the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I interpose?  Why was it necessary to ascertain that information whether they were policemen or not?  I mean you already had come closer to them and you had identified them as being the same persons that had been pointed out by Ashley to you?  Why then go to the extent of getting that kind of information from them?  It doesn't make sense to me, your order is to kill and not to confirm an information.  Why then should you torture in order to seek to confirm any kind of information?  Why go outside the scope of your specific orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Well Madame Chair that time there's nothing I could have done, it just happened that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You know, you keep on telling us that there's nothing that you could have done.  We are here to get evidence from you in order to consider your application.  We expect to receive information by way of evidence from you.  It will not assist us in getting responses "there's nothing that I could have done."  We need information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> May I just interpose here?  Tell me, did you search them for firearms, these two policemen or so called policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes we - because I was the first one to the car I ...[indistinct] under the seats while I was at the back of the seat also there were no firearms in their possession.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> But surely a security cop would wear a firearm on his person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> We come again back there and that's why maybe we continued to torture them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> To do what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> To find out why - because there was no firearms in the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Now didn't you then when they denied - think that they were not policemen, they deny it, there are no firearms, not in the car, not on their person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes they denied they were ...[indistinct]</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a>but they just ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> No, that's not my question.  My question is, should you not then have thought that these guys are not policemen?  They've got no firearms, there are no firearms in the car and they say they are not policemen and you keep on torturing them, why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Mrs Chair I think there is some cops that walk without firearms at that time so it's obvious I took it maybe that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Why did you keep on torturing if you knew that they were cops in your own mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I can't answer that question Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Isn't it true Mr Plaatjies that there was no reason for you to torture them in order to extract any kind of information if you were actually executing the instructions of Mr Ashley which did not say you must torture to obtain any kind of information which instructions merely said kill them because they are investigating you for among others gun running?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes Mrs Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And therefore what you did you did outside the instructions given by Mr Ashley?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> I would say that was because by that time Madame Chair it was war, there was nothing I could have done, it was war.  I agree with Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> You say you abducted them to question them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> To get information from them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> That's correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> If they had given you that information would you still have shot them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> Yes because I should have shot them to protect my identity at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> So you would have shot them for the reason of protecting your identity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR PLAATJIES:</span> And the cell group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed to the next issue Ms Thabete.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Thank you, no further questions Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETE</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Do you have any re-examination Mr Leopeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> No re-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Leopeng, are you in a position to address us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Madame Chair, I ask for a short adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why?  You don't need a short adjournment.  This is a very simple matter, there's nothing complex, there is no evidence that has been led here that is not in your papers.  Why should you require an adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Madame Chair, it's not an adjournment for the purpose of consultation or whatever, it's just ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, you don't need a consultation for purposes of addressing us, you address us on the evidence that has been led by way of viva voce and by way of documents, we have Annexure A which is his application form and Annexure B is the supplementary affidavit and you have been sitting there listening to the vive voce evidence given by Mr Plaatjies.  What more do you need in order to prepare for your legal address?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> I will proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG IN ARGUMENT:</span> Well Madame Chair and the Committee my argument will just very simply be that the idea and the main objective of the applicant in abducting and killing one of</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a>the two abducted Indian chaps was just to ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he abduct only one Indian chap or he abducted both?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> He abducted both and killed one, that's the evidence, was simply that he abducted and killed one solely because they were investigating him for the gun running, that's the evidence and that's all ...[indistinct] the objective as he said was just to send a clear message to other security officers and I do not have further argument on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does that conclude your address?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabete?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE IN ARGUMENT:</span> Madame Chair, my submission to there that the applicant has contradicted himself in his evidence when cross-examined and in the issue of following orders, I mean in his affidavit he's made it clear that it was on his own initiative to eliminate the victims and I think this is in line with his reason behind because he says they were investigating him or he believed that they were investigating him.  It goes very well with the fact that he could have taken an initiative to eliminate them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a>	Further Madame Chair, the basis of having identified the victims is really, it's nothing political, I mean the applicant has </p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a>given evidence that they were identified on the basis that they were Indians which doesn't even link him to the objective that he alleges that he wanted to give a clear signal to the security policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a>	Madame Chair, I would submit in short that there's nothing political according to the evidence given by the applicant and given the fact that he has contradicted himself so much and the fact that he keeps on saying there's nothing that he could do even though he claims that he was a member.  It looks like he didn't even have authority to give such instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a>	I don't think really he complied with the requirement of full disclosure and it is my submission that amnesty should be refused.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Ms Thabete.  This Committee will take a short adjournment in order to consider the evidence tendered by Mr Plaatjies in support of his application for amnesty and we'll come back and pronounce our decision after ten minutes.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We have now come to a decision in respect of the application by Mr Julian Dion Plaatjies which was heard today being the 12th February 1999 and this is our decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a>This is an application for amnesty in terms of Section 18 of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995.  Mr Plaatjies applies for amnesty in respect of the following convictions:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a>1.	Kidnapping of Deran Ramakanjee.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a>	2.	Kidnapping of Arula Padajachee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a>	3.	The assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm </p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a>		in respect of Deran Ramankanjee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a>	4.	The assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm in respect of Arula Padajachee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a>	5.	The attempted murder of Deran Ramakanjee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a>	6.	The murder of Arula Padajachee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a>All these offences were committed on the 15th January 1993 at or near Coronation in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a>	After having heard the testimony of the applicant and having noted the supplementary affidavit handed in on his behalf, we as a Committee are not satisfied that the applicant acted with a political motive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a>	Furthermore, we have no doubt that the acts applied for were in fact acts of criminality, committed for personal gain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a>	Accordingly, the applicant does not comply with Section 20 sub-section 1 of the Act and AMNESTY IS THEREFORE REFUSED.  That is our decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEOPENG:</span> As it pleases the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> As it pleases the Committee, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Leopeng, you may be excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a>	Ms Thabete, does this not bring us to the end of the day and the week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Yes Madame Chair it does.  I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to the victims in the matter of Vusi Sydney Gadefe Manoni.  They've come all the way from Giani.  Unfortunately we have to hear it next week, I've explained it to them, next week on Wednesday, otherwise Madame Chair, it concludes our roll for this week until next week Tuesday where will be doing the matter of Gadebe and Mkhwanasi and on Wednesday the matter of Vusi Sydney Manoni.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think on behalf of the Amnesty Committee the panel would like to extend it's appreciation to our transcribers, the translators for the difficult job they have to do.  To the persons from the witness protection programme and not forgetting members of Correctional Services, we really appreciate the fact that you were always prompt in bringing applicants to this venue and our warmest appreciation to the media for the wonderful job that they are performing in enabling our society to be part of this process and most importantly, to the members of the public for participating in this process.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>	We have now come to the end of our hearings this week.  We will resume next week on Tuesday the 16th February with the remainder of our roll.  Thank you very much and enjoy your weekend.</p>
