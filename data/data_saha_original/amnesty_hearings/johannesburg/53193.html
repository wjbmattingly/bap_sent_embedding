<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Can we proceed with the next matter?  I call Antony Maci.  He is present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>Pages 95 to 101 Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Maci what language would you want to use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Xhosa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> He'll use Xhosa.  Xhosa will be on channel three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">UNKNOWN:</span> And how do you pronounce your surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> It's M A C I, Maci.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you any objections to the taking of the oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">ANTONY MACI:</span> (sworn, states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please be seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR SHANE:</span> Mr Maci, first of all, your identity number is on your application.  660327 5676 08 3.  Is that the correct number?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> You will see on page 100 of your application you signed it.  Is this your signature at the bottom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> That's correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> But you never ever signed it before a Commissioner of Oaths.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> But you are under oath now and what you say will be the truth.  Is that correct?  Your application wasn't signed before a Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> It's the absolute truth, what I'm going to say to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you signed this affidavit or statement were you aware of the contents of this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Yes, I was fully aware of the contents of my statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you understood it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were satisfied that it contained what you wanted it to contain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Today you are a member of the South African police stationed at Katlehong, and you're a constable.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> You applied for amnesty first of all for the unlawful possession of firearms, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> What type of firearms were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> It's AK-47 rifles and pistols and RPG7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Is that a rocket launcher or what?  What's known as a bazooka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Yes, that's the one known as a bazooka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> And you also possessed ammunition for these weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Yes I had ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> And did that ammunition also include the projectile that we would fire from your so called bazooka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> And you say besides the possession of the weapon you were involved in the transportation of these weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Yes, because the committee would give me funds to go and get these ammunitions from Polla Park, in Vosloorus hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you were dealing in firearms.  Wasn't that it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> May the speaker speak up, the applicant, we cannot hear him clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> We would go and look for arms in Polla Park and a hostel in Vosloorus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Would you buy them with money that was given to you by the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> And you would buy them in Polla Park from a certain Mozambican by the name of David, who was in a wheelchair.  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Yes, we bought them from David, and if he did not have stock, he would accompany us to Vosloorus where we would buy them and come back with the full stock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right, you bought them at Vosloorus at a hostel, you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Was this an IFP hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Now you also, you bought them from another person in Shongweni section, Katlehong, as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> That is correct.  It was a Mr Madikizela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> And then you would transport these weapons back to the community.  Can you tell the Commission, the Committee, whose vehicle did you use to transport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> We used community cars, and sometimes we would use Dumisani Sithole's car to go and buy these weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> And besides the weapons that you transported and bought, you also possessed your own AK-47 and pistol.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Yes that is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Now, you apply for amnesty for murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> That is so, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right.  First of all, you murdered, you shot a person by the name of Sikelo Nyekane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Yes I shot him, but it was a mistake.  I thought they were the enemy, the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Now, when you shot Sikelo, is it correct that you had recently been released from detention without trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> You were in a house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MACI:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Whose house was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Shane you're treading on thin ice here.  Your client has given what looks like an incorrect answer, and you're leading him now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right, now explain ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say that the killing of Nyekane was an accident, mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MACI:</span> That is so, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why do you say it's a mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman, if I can lead him, it will emerge exactly why it was a crime, why it wasn't self defence, and I will lead him in why it was a political crime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Shane I would thank you not to interrupt me.  Why do you say it was a mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Somebody knocked roughly and kicked the doors.  I enquired who was knocking and the person did not answer.  As he was busy kicking the door, and as soon as the door opened I shot immediately.  And when he fell inside the house that's when I noticed that it was Sithelo.  That is why I say it's a mistake, because I mistook him for the internal stability unit police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> So when you heard this knock on the door, and when there was no response to your asking who it was, that's when you thought in your mind that this was the police, the ISU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> When you thought it was the ISU, what did you think that they, that means the ISU, were going to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> I thought they were going to arrest me, and detain me, and I was avoiding that.  And I was in possession of an unlicensed AK-47 rifle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Now, besides you not getting any response to you asking who was there when you heard this knock, you mentioned something about kicking the door, on the door.  This person that was there was kicking on the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> What type of kicking was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> It was a rough kick, he was trying to kick the door open, that is why I thought it was the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> So is it a similar way that the police behaved when they came knocking on doors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MACI:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that a bit of expert leading Mr Shane?  Do you have personal knowledge of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman I imagine the applicant does, because he was previously detained.  I was just, it's coming from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Precisely, do you have it?  How can you put it to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I don't have personal knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So leave it to him to describe then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> If this person who was on the other side of the door, the deceased Sikelo, if he responded to you when you asked who was there, would he have been shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> No I wouldn't have shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Because Sikelo was not a political enemy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MACI:</span> Yes, he was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> And the only reason that you shot him was because in your mind it was the police on the other end of the door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Now you say when the door opened you opened fire with your AK-47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MACI:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Did you shoot through the door ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Mr Shane, really I have great difficulty too with the leading questions you are asking.  I'm sure, Mr Shane I haven't finished.  I'm sure the applicant, having given the instructions, can tell us in his own words exactly what happened.  I don't remember him saying the door opened at all.  You are putting that to him and he can only say yes or no to you.  Mr Shane we are not getting the story from him.  You know that it is the process is we hear from the applicant.  He's quite capable of telling us the story himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right, can you describe, after there was no response to you asking who was there, and you heard this rough kicking on the door, what did you do then?  What actually happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> I became ready as I realised that it was the enemy that was kicking the door, which is the police.  Therefore I prepared myself to shoot and I did shoot, and he landed inside the house and that is when I noticed that it was Sikelo.  My uncle rushed him to hospital with his car, so that he should not die, because it was a mistake, he was not an enemy.  Unfortunately he died at the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Can you remember how many bullets you fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> It was only bullet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Is it also true that you assisted with his funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What has that got to do with the price of eggs Mr Shane?  Are you trying to prove the man was not guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> No Mr Chairman that doesn't prove he's not guilty, it's just he's given ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman I'm just leading him on these factors.  This is just a factor that I was just leading him after the incident.  It's just something that he's saying.  It's got nothing to do with the killing as such.  He said he killed the person by mistake and he's given the circumstances.  Quite clearly I'm trying to show that this was a political, it was a political act on his part, notwithstanding the fact that it was clearly a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Shane I want to ask you not to clutter up the record unnecessarily, and lead your witness the way he should be led on the relevant issues.  We are not concerned about his financial contribution to the funeral.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right, that is, there's nothing further that you can say about the death of Sikelo Nyekane.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Our families came together and arrangements were made and everything was organised for his funeral in Transkei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Besides that, there's nothing about what we're talking.  The Commission is not interested in what happened regarding the funeral.  They just want to know the details of his death.  You've told everything about his death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Yes I've said everything I wanted to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Was Sikelo an SDU member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> We were staying together at my home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> So he was coming home actually, because he lived with you in that house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> How were you related to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> They were renting on our premises and we all came from the Transkei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Now is it also correct you were involved in the killing of another two males?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MACI:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Can you give a description of what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you carry on, when did the killing of Sikelo take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> If my memory serves me well I think it was late 1993 or January 94.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't know when you shot your friend, who was not an enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Truly speaking I cannot remember the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You estimate it in what year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> I think it was January 1994 but I cannot remember the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> What time of the day was it when the incident happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> I do not want to lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well was it in the morning, afternoon, night, midnight, whatever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> It think it was past eight or past nine in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right, you were involved in the killing of another two people, males, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Can you give a description of what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> I will talk about Mtolo first, Mtolo.  There was a general meeting that was held at Mpumelela School in Makula Section.  Mtolo had fled from Polla Park because he was the cause of the fights between the SDU's themselves who were shooting one another and Mtolo fled to Katlehong at Makula Section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>	We got the message that Mtolo was not a good person because he was also working with the police.   He was supposed to be killed.  Secondly ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right, when you say he was supposed to be killed, did you get orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Yes, we were given orders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> By who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Our Commander, Bruce, told us to go and shoot him, it was myself, Max and Thabiso Mapige.  I was armed with a pistol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>	The two of them were armed with AK47 rifles.  We met with him at a passage.  I fired the first shot, they followed with their AK47 rifles, I gave them a chance to shoot him with their AK47 rifles, and I was the one who shot first.  He died.  We left him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> We found him at Makula Section, there was a passage.  We found him there after we were looking for him at a certain place where he was residing.  We met him at the passage and we killed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right.  You were also involved in the killing of another person, can you give a description of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> We shot Mr Ntshingila,  Mr Ntshingila,  after having received information from a gentleman who was staying at a house where we had put our firearms.  We heard that Mr Ntshingila had told the police that we had hidden the guns in this gentleman's place and this gentleman was an inyanga, a healer, and he was well known even in the white community and they told him who gave them this information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>	An urgent meeting was convened at school and the issue of Ntshingila as an informant was discussed, and he was also a shop owner at Kwesine Hostel that was occupied by IFP members and the people from the townships would not go to that hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>	Mr Ntshingila was called to the meeting at the school and the community was there, people from our community.  When he arrived there and when he was being questioned, he made some utterances that were showing that he was undermining everybody and he even mentioned that no one was going to touch him, he was going to bring the people from the IFP organisation to come and attack the Makula Section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>	The community was very angry and the community was forced to drive Mr Ntshingila to his place.  The people from the community decided to cut their telephone wires and I was the first one to shoot him.  Sol Bongani Madirabe shot him with a pump gun and another gentleman who is in kwaZulu Natal, who is in Newcastle, his name was Gorgothi, I cannot remember his real name, he was armed with an AK47 rifle, he also shot at him and he died.  He died at his house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Just go over that for me very briefly.  He came to the meeting and was difficult at the meeting.  Then he left the meeting and you followed him.  Just from that point, where exactly did you kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> When we left the meeting, he was in the company of the community, he was driven to his home.  When we arrived there, the telephone wires were disconnected and we did as the Commander said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> So this was a community meeting, not a SDU meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Yes, that is correct, it was a meeting of the community and all the SDU members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> All of the people who were at that meeting, observed the execution of Mr Ntshingila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Right, now at this community meeting you said the community said certain things to the deceased.   Members of the community spoke to the deceased at this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> As he was called to the meeting, the intention was to question him as to why he was giving information to the police concerning the arms.  He told the community that he was sick and tired of that in Makula community and he was about to bring the IFP members to come and attack the Makula Section.  That is why he was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> So from what you are saying, he actually threatened the community at the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Can you give the names of the other people that also were involved in his killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Members of the community, all of them were there.  The people who shot at him, it was myself and Solomon and this other gentleman who is in Natal now.  His nickname was Gorgothi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> You were the one who shot first, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> How many bullets did you fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> I cannot remember but I was using my pistol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> What happened afterwards with all the weapons that you had, what became of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MACI:</span> The weapons, I went to Malusko for police training and the weapons were left with the community members, and when I came back, I was told that those weapons were taken to the police station as they were instructed to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> That is evidence, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SHANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Steenkamp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I don't have any further questions, thank you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, I don't have questions for the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I have no more applicants, Mr Chairman.  May I be excused please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that it for today or ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> That is it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Shane, we just wanted to deal with one aspect before you go, Sicelo, in terms of your client's testimony, was killed accidentally.  How does that event fall into the Act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman, as he testified, he only realised it was an accident after the event, in other words, when there was that knock on the door, and he described the type of knocking, it was a rough kind of kicking, that is what he described, he also asked who it was when there was this knock on the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>	There was no answer.  We also heard that he had recently been released from detention without trial.  In his mind, this was the police, the ISU coming to arrest him to detain him, as he said.  Quite clearly they were the enemy, he had his weapon, his AK47.  In order to avoid giving these "police", though they weren't the police, but he shot.  It is clearly I submit with respect, a political act on his part. </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>	Notwithstanding the fact that it was an accident.  I hope that answers your question Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If that is your view, deal with the following, that the Act gives particular guidelines in Section 20(3) where one has to consider the factual position and how it really improves the political situation of the party on whose behalf a person, the applicant, acted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>	Now, how did the killing of Sicelo improve the political position of the party on whose behalf your client acted that day?  Never mind intention, what is the factual position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> The factual position with respect is it didn't improve any political position.  I am not going to argue that it did, because it didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now bearing that in mind, how does it fall within the ambit of the Act?  First of all it can't be murder, he had no intention to murder Sicelo, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> No intention to murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In the criminal court, what would it be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> It would be negligent killing boiling down to culpable homicide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand the Act, it makes provision for the commission of crimes with the intention of improving a political position, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>	Does the Act make provision for accidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> First of all Mr Chairman, dealing with intention, I submit that intention is quite significant here because his intention when he fired the shot, was to kill the police, or to shoot the police, and that in itself, improves the political position that you were talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>	I would submit that the Act does not exclude mistakes or negligence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why do you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Well Mr Chairman, in this case, one would ask is all the negligence on the part of the applicant, remember as he said, had the deceased answered to his name when he was asked, there was no answer, but had he answered his name before he opened the door, had he answered his name, this incident would not have happened at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  If he thought it was the police outside banging as he was asked to describe so graphically, why didn't he shoot through the door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I can't answer that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I ask that question in view of your argument, because you make out a particular argument.  It follows then as I understand your argument, that if he really thought it was the police and he wanted to get away or whatever reason he shot, he should have shot through the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Well Mr Chairman, it is significant that even though it is a bit hazy as to how he shot, the fact is when he shot, he did not know, when he shot, he did not know it was Sicelo, in his mind it was the police he was shooting at.  It was only after Sicelo fell, that he realised the mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>	That is clear Mr Chairman, it was a mistake, but before the mistake was made, when he pulled the trigger, at that crucial time he pulled the trigger, in his mind, he was shooting at the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How does that help him?  Let's assume that we accept that that was what his mind set was at that time, how does it help him?  You've got to help us here, we are in a (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Mr Chairman, I will submit at the end of the day, it must be his intention.  It was his intention to shoot the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>	Everything, all the surrounding circumstances indicated to him that this is the police that is behind the door.  There was no answer to his request for the person to identify himself, there was no response.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>	The way that the door was knocked on, indicated to him this was the police.  After there was no response, when he saw the door opening, he fired a shot through the door.  That is as I understood his testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Significantly that door opened and then he shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He didn't shoot through the door.  He shot at the door once the door was opened, that is what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Well Mr Chairman, that is my argument, I can't take it any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Excuse me Mr Chairman, I must bring to your attention my client informs me that as far as he is concerned, he says he shot through the door.  That was what he says and he says this might have been misinterpreted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>	I can't take that further, I don't know what the interpretation is.  I don't know if it can be replayed, but I will say this as well Mr Chairman, my instructions in fact were, but I heard what you heard Mr Chairman, it certainly didn't come through in the interpretation that he shot through the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>	That is certainly not the impression that I got from the interpretation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was interpreted, as soon as the door opened, he shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, that is how I got it as well.  I am told by my client that that is not what he said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Steenkamp, is it possible for you and Mr Shane to listen to the tape recording and agree on what was actually said and whether the interpretation was correct or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> I will do that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I can't assist, I don't understand the interpretation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the new interpretation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, that is not my interpretation at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the new interpretation, because what was interpreted, words to the effect that as soon as the door opened, I shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, I spoke to the Interpreter herself, and according to her, that was what was interpreted.  It was interpreted that while kicking, he was shot.  There was, the applicant shot at the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it possible for us to hear those tapes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> It is possible Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then let's hear it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Unfortunately, I cannot understand Zulu, but that is what was told to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's hear it.  I've got a colleague here who can see if it was interpreted properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, that specific section is available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We would like to hear it over here.  We listened to the tape recording and we are in total agreement that what was said there was that as soon as the door opened, I shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>	It wasn't a question of shooting through the door.  Mr Steenkamp, I don't know about your latest request, because I have already excused the applicant.  I think in his favour, I don't think it is fair to put him at risk after he has been excused.  Mr Shane, I understand that you know what the latest developments are, about a  new witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> I was briefly told by Mr Steenkamp sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, I am not going to allow that.  You can explain to your client please.  What is next.  Your client is excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANE:</span> You also did excuse me sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Mr Steenkamp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, that will be the roll for today.</p>

<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So we've got seven left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> (Microphone not on)  One of the matters Mr Chairman, was actually removed from the roll, there is actually six matters for tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>	That is including Mr Selepe, will be seven, you are absolutely correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I want to finish that lot tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> I have informed the attorneys already Mr Chairman.</p>
