            "There are additional documents filed by the objectors, which have not yet been paginated.  We will take care of it in due course in consultation with counsel for the Commission so that all those facts which really is an attempt to define the issues before you, we will put them all into that file.\n\tNow, Mr Chairman, our approach to this matter is that this is neither an appeal nor a review of the judgment given by his Lordship, Mr Justice Nugent.  The Committee has a statutory duty to perform which, or the section in it which deals with what it has to enquire into and make up its mind and give a decision on the facts and circumstances that have been placed before it.  Nothing said by Nugent, J is binding on this Committee.  \tWe do not have to quote authority for this proposition, because the learned Judge himself on an early page of his judgment clearly states that inquest findings are not bound on anyone, they are made on a prima facie basis and that in any event there is a different test and different legal requirements in this regard.  \tNow, we have attempted by asking a number of questions before to place before you facts by way of admission and for that purpose we served a document on the objectors, which is the document before you, pages 1 to 12 in which various questions were asked.  We thought that we would obtain sufficient information about what we believe to be matters which were either common cause or not seriously contested by way of admission.  It is with some regret that we wish to place on record that the objectors did not avail themselves of this opportunity of responding to what we believe were facts which ought to be either common cause or not seriously disputed.  \n\tThe other was that right at the outset on page 2, Mr Chairman, we asked questions in order to identify the objectors and tell us what it is, what harm they have suffered in order that the Committee may decide as to whether their injuries, if any, and precisely where they were injured and whether their injuries really qualify them as objectors proper.  I'm not of course speaking in relation to the eight deceased, Mr Chairman.  Unfortunately we have not had much joy as a response, but more importantly on page 3 we asked the following questions:\n\"The objectors are requested to state on what grounds each of them intends to oppose the applications for amnesty;\"\nParagraph 3 -\n\"If it is alleged that the applications do not comply with the requirements of the promotion of national unity and reconciliation, Act no 34 of 1995, the objectors are requested to identify the applications which allegedly do not comply with the requirements of the Act;\"\n and 3.2 -\n\"To specify in what respects the said applications allegedly do not comply with the requirements of the Act.  If it is alleged that the acts of offences to which the applications relate are not acts associated with a political objective committed in the course of the conflicts of the past in accordance with the provisions of Section 22, 23 of the Act, the objectors are requested.  To identify the acts or offences which allegedly are not acts associated with a political objective, committed in the course of the conflicts of the past and in accordance with the provisions of Sections 22 and 23 of the Act;\"\nand 4.2 -   \n\"To specify in what respect the said acts or offences allegedly are not acts associated with a political objective, committed in the course of the conflicts of the past and in accordance with the provisions of Sections 20.2 and 20.3 of the Act;\"\n5\n\"If it is alleged that the applicants for amnesty have not made a full disclosure of all relevant facts, each of the objectors is requested to identify the applicants for amnesty who allegedly have not made a full disclosure of all relevant facts, and in respect of each applicant for amnesty to specify in what respect the said applicants for amnesty has allegedly not made a full disclosure of all the relevant facts and to specify all relevant facts which the said applicants for amnesty has allegedly failed to disclose.\"\n\tNow, we want to indicate to you Mr Chairman, the answers.  Unfortunately not all the documents have not all been paginated but the first one has, it is the applicant's request for further particulars and admissions on page 108.\n\tThis was a response by Mosselson & Associates in a document dated the 5th of May and Miss van der Westhuizen has associated herself with the answers given, so this is the document of those two objectors, and in relation to paragraph 2 they say on page 111 -\n\"The applicants are referred to the affidavits by the objectors in this regard.\"\nThe affidavits by the objectors in relation to this issue is to be found on page - I'm sorry, we have paginated it for ourselves, and we will try and persuade counsel for the Committee to paginate the same.  It's at page 122 -\n\"I have been advised that the applications of the guards who were injured do not comply with the requirements of the promotion of the National Unity and Reconciliation Act, and state that full legal argument of this point will be advanced before the Commission at the hearing of the matter.\"",

            "Yes, Mr Chairman.   Then, as far as question no 3 is concerned, the answer given on page 112, paragraph 9 is\n\"This request is the subject of legal argument which will be advanced at the appropriate time during the course of the proceedings.\"\nAgain hardly a helpful response in the circumstances Mr Chairman.  The same answer is given on the same page 112, in answer to paragraph 4 on page 3, and paragraph 5 on page 4.  So that our attempt to define the issues and possibly save time thereby has failed.  It may not be too late, Mr Chairman, because our learned friends may be persuaded that they ought to respond meaningfully to this during the course of the proceedings.  \n\tI may say right at the outset, Mr Chairman, that we will object to any court time being sought in order to do this.  We are anxious to conclude the matter as soon as possible.  What I mean by that is that they may want to make use of the court hours, the time, in order to really try and define the issues before the Committee.  They're not obliged to do it, however, Mr Chairman, but we thought that we would draw your attention to that fact.\n\tNow, we ask in paragraph 6 what each of the objectors must specify whether the said objector intends to be present and to testify at the hearing of the applicants for amnesty, what evidence the said objector intends to adduce at the hearing, what article or articles the said objector intends to submit at the hearing to be taken into consideration.  \n\tMay I indicate, Mr Chairman, that the spirit in which these questions were asked was not to tie the objectors down to anything specific to which they did not want be specific about, but rather we hoped that if the information was given, we may be able to admit if we were given for instance medical records that this person was shot in the thigh or in the knee and if we could go outside court hours investigate this matter, we could make admissions which would may have been unnecessary for witnesses to be called.  However, we failed in that endeavour to shorten the proceedings as well.  \n\tNow, in relation to part B, on page 5, Mr Chairman, we also asked for admissions.  Firstly that the transcripts identified below accurately record the conversation and speeches of referred to therein, noting in certain instances the third transcripts do not cover the entire conversation or speech concerned and that such transcripts can be used at the hearing without further proof.  \n\tFirstly, the SAP radio reports, channel 27, on the 28th of March 1994, here we are pleased to inform the Committee that there has been a helpful response by the objectors in that they admit that what is referred to as \"channel 27\", which is an important document and which was an important document at the inquest but which unfortunately was only produced by those who had possession of it, the police, in July after the inquest had been going on for a number of months but it does contain important information.  I am corrected, Mr Chairman, on page 94 of this bundle you will find that Mr Wilsenach who appears for some of the objectors, the firm of attorneys for the objectors, they admitted Mr Chairman, on page 94 in paragraph 1.1.1 - it's particularly Dr van Wyk, Mr Chairman, who's is appearing here, who made that admission.  On page 5, that's page 5 of our documents, Mr Mosselson, by way of contrast - or Mosselsons by way of contrast, in paragraph F on page 114, paragraph 15 there says -\n\"The objectors are not in a position to either deny or admit the documents referred to in paragraph 1.1 to 1.9 of the request.\"\nSo that we are in a position that you will see on page 5, 6 up to top of page 7 that Mosselson could not admit or deny any of the matters that we asked for, we therefor have to prove them, Mr Chairman.  \n\tIn relation to the radio channel 27, again we would urge that the legal representatives in consonance with their duty to the Committee and possibly to their clients, that the matter of the proof of that recording should possibly be admitted as the other matters that we have referred to, so that we can make some progress Mr Chairman.\n\tThen, in paragraph 2 of page 7 of our request -\n\"That the gathering at Library Gardens on the 28th of March 1994 and the marches associated therewith, took place at the instance of the IFP.\"\nWe would have thought Mr Chairman, that that matter could easily have been admitted but it has not.  The objectors represented by Dr van Wyk cannot - they deny it outright at page 95, paragraph 1.2 and Mosselson cannot admit or deny it, at page 114, paragraph 16.",

It may become necessary, Mr Chairman, to add documents to it.  We will ask that they be numbered consecutively.  Now, remember, Mr Chairman, what the question we asked was on page 2 of page 7 - please turn to page 2 of bundle B.  The question was -\n\"That the gathering at the Library Gardens on the 28th of March 1994, and the marches associated therewith took place at the instance of the IFP.\"\nThe one says that they deny it, the other says that they have no knowledge.  I am going to refer to documents which are, and have been available to the objectors Mr Chairman, at least since the beginning of 1977, 1997 - it only ages me Mr Chairman, or shows my age - sorry, if I'm twenty years out sometimes, please feel free to correct me.  \n\tNow, here we have a document which has been in their possession since the beginning of 1997 when the documents were distributed by the Attorney-General from whose possession they came, and they were made available to all the parties.  It's on the letterhead of the Inkatha Freedom Party, it is signed by Mr Humphrey Ndlovu, whom I may say one or - I think he had separate counsel for himself but they worked in close co-operation with our learned friends who appear for the objectors: \n\"I hereby wish to ask for permission for the IFP launch of its anti-election campaign at the Johannesburg Library grounds on Monday the 28th of March 1994.  This gathering will be peaceful and will be from 09h00 - 14h00.  Approximately 20 000 people will be attending this launch.  Your assistance will be highly appreciated.  Yours in the continuous search for peace and democracy in our country.\n\t\tMr Humphrey Ndlovu - IFP : West Rand - Chairperson.\"\n\tNow, if we go to page 3, \"Name of the Organisation\", you will see on the application form:\n\"To the Magistrate\"\nin Johannesburg.  \n\"Name of the Organisation - Inkatha Freedom Party - IFP\"\nand the address of the IFP right on top.  \n\tNow, Mr Chairman, the absence of this admission and a fiction which has been created that the IFP had nothing to do with this march, is a deliberate smoke-screen in order to avoid responsibility for what happened on the 28th of March 1994, and we don't intend leading viva voce evidence in relation to whose march it was, unless Mr Chairman, specific evidence is led by the objectors to contradict this documentation that we have put before you.  We submit that the section requires you to hear evidence and receive information.  We have given the information, we have said where it comes from, we do not want to take up time, through calling the Magistrate or anyone else.",

            "Yes.  \tNow, then, Mr Chairman, page 4\n\"Purpose of the demonstrations, protests, march - Anti-election campaign\"\nIf you could go back to page 3: \n\"Names of all the organisers - Humphrey Ndlovu\"\non page 3 and it will emerge during the course of the evidence that Mr Humphrey Ndlovu is not an Induna or a representative of His Majesty the King of the Zulus, but a member of the IFP and a senior office bearer of what was then known as Transvaal, and particularly the western branch, and that it was in that capacity that he put these matters into motion.\n\tThen, page 4:\n\"Purpose of the demonstration protest - Anti-election campaign\"\nnot the King's demands, Mr Chairman.  Now, the fact that marches and not only a gathering was envisaged by Mr Ndlovu is proved by the answer to the question:\n\"Route which procession would follow or venue for staging demonstration\"\non page 4, towards the bottom, Mr Chairman, \n\"people will come from different destinations and some will be coming around the town and suburbs of Johannesburg.\"\nSo, we submit that this is a clear indication that it was anticipated that there would be marches, and that they would be coming on trains and foot, on page 5:\n\"And for what purpose\"\nagain:\n\"the anti-election campaign\".\n\tIf you would turn, Mr Chairman, to pages 15 and 16 of bundle B, you will observe an indemnity given and entered into by the Inkatha Freedom Party and not His Majesty the King, or anyone else, represented by one Peter B Mangwasa, who says:\n\"On behalf of and duly authorised to by the Organisation\"\nand the organisation is defined in the first whereas on page 15 as the Inkatha Freedom Party.  They indemnify and hold ...(inaudible) the counsel and others Mr Chairman.  It's signed on the 25th of March and it's duly witnessed.  \n\tNow, there can be no doubt in our mind as to who organised this and we submit that the evidence clearly, placed before you clearly shows that.  We also ask that Mr Humphrey Ndlovu and Mr Themba Nkosa, in their capacities as senior office bearers of the IFP were instrumental in the conception of the gathering at the Library Gardens and the associated marches.  The response is the same, the one says \"I can't admit or deny\" and the other denies.  \tNow, we will place material before the Committee by reading transcripts of telephone conversations on the morning of the 28th of March 1994, again which became available to all our learned friends at or about the beginning of the inquest in April 1997 and our learned friends have had copies of these.  They have listened to evidence in relation to the provenance and authenticity of these transcripts and they should have had no difficulty in making an admission in that regard, but - if you could please turn page 101 of bundle B and refer you to the hand-written portion:\n\"H Ndlovu and Captain Wilken\"\nBoth these persons gave evidence at the inquest.  Our learned friends could ascertain quite easily whether they should make an admission or not but the contents clearly show that Captain Wilken, who was identified as the Liaison Officer of the South African Police and the conversation was at 07h45 in the morning.  They are apparently on good terms, because the first entry is: \n\"Humphrey!, good morning and how are you.\"\n\t\t\"Hi I'm looking for you.  I wanted to page you but I'm on my way to the office.\"    \n\t\t\"Humphrey, listen, we have big problems this morning, man.\"\n\t\t\"Where?\"\n\t\t\"You know, in Alexander, at the Hostels.  People are throwing stones to the vehicles.  They are shooting, shooting at the policemen who have got big chaos in town.  I wonder, can you make contact with the people at the Hostels, man, to tell them to discipline and come into town?  Either discipline, or we're going to have big problems today.\"\n\t\t\"I see.\"  \n\t\t\"You know really, we want to give our full support, but the people seems to me, they're getting out of hand now, man.

The one denies it, the other one says they don't know.  They can so easily have found out and can so easily make an admission, Mr Chairman.  \n\tLet us now deal with Mr Themba Nkosa because the question was concerned with him as well.  Could you please turn to page 98 on bundle B, Mr Chairman.  I'm sorry, can you just bear one moment, one of our - we'll just find the page, my page is different to Mr Tipp's.   On page ...(indistinct) 28th of March '94, this too was produced by the Attorney-General's office and handed to the parties at the commencement of the inquest proceedings and if we look at it, we submit that in the absence of an admission the Committee ought not to have much difficulty in finding as a fact that together with Mr Ndlovu, Mr Nkosa was orchestrating the happenings on the streets of Johannesburg on the day in question.  \n\"Themba your people ne, are breaking down the place, man.\"\nWe will refer to this later for another purpose, but let us -\n\"Your people\",\nsays Mr Wilkins, the Senior Police Officer who obviously knows Mr Themba Nkosa quite well, and what is his answer,\n\"you must expect that\"\nYou must expect that my people will break the place down.  Mr Chairman, we are becoming impatient with the attitude of the persons that are opposing these proceedings and who were at the inquest.  We asked them a simple question which can be answered truthfully on behalf of their clients, when they have the information.  We ...[indistinct] foot to the proof of it, and we are told that this was a peaceful march for a demand of their things.  \n\"No, man, there's people on their way to work now, and they're throwing stones, etc, etc, and I don't want to act, man, is their now way that we can make contact with the people at the hostels and tell them to just don't throw stones and that stuff?\n\t\tMR NKOSA:   \"I have a problem\"\n\t\t\"Yes?\"\n\t\t\"Things have changed now, you know, I don't need to tell you.

That again should have been an easy matter for an admission, but it was not made. \n\"5.  That the IFP foresaw that there would be wide public violence committed by many of those attending the gathering or participating in associated marches\"\nWell, they were not prepared to make any admission in relation to that.  \n\"That groups of marches attending the gathering attacked and killed pedestrians and motorists on their way to the gathering\".\nThey deny those allegations.  The one denies and the other one says, no knowledge, does not have any instructions in relation to it.  \n\tIn view of the evidence that was available, we will submit that it's quite easy to make - they should consider, possibly, before these proceedings get out of hand, that they make a formal admission.\n\"That a number of groups of marches passed Shell House earlier on the 28th of March 1994, during which they behaved provocatively and launched mock attacks on ANC security guards, but there were not shot at by the said security guards.\"\nAgain there are videos, there are - well, let me put it this way, although there may not be videos of these particular marches, there is video material and there is sufficient evidence from persons other than the security guards from whom we appear, for them to be able to ascertain and whether they should make an admission in relation to that remark.  Then paragraph 8,\n\"That the organisers of the gathering and the marchers were at all material times aware that the Shell House was the national headquarters of the ANC and that Lancet Hall was the regional headquarters of the ANC.\"\nThere is a denial of that by Dr van Wyk and Mosselson says that they can't admit or deny. \n\"That the said organisers were at all material times aware that there was an extensive history of conflict\nfrequently violent between members of the IFP and members of the ANC and that in view of the imminence of the first democratic election, political feelings were running very high as at 28th March 1994.\"\nAgain we have in 1.4 page 96, there is an admission of they were aware of the history of conflict, Mr Chairman, but that is Dr van Wyk but Mosselson says that they can't admit or deny it.  So we are in this position Mr Chairman, that if one of the parties only admits, we have to prove it.  \nThen, in relation to paragraph 12\n\"That from Park Station the marchers did not move in the direction of Library Gardens\"\n11, I beg you pardon, I'm reading paragraph 11, \n\"That from Park Station the marchers did not move in the direction of Library Gardens but split into groups, some moving east along Loot Street and then south down King George Street, and others moving south down Wanderer Street then east along De Villiers Street.\"\nI'm sorry, I omitted paragraph 10,\n\"That the marchers involved in the shooting incident at Shell House were from the Mansfield Hostel and had travelled from there by train to Park Station.\"\nNow, 10, 11 and 12 are admitted, which I must read,\n\"That the marches moving into these groups then advanced at the intersection of King George, converged I beg your pardon, and De Villiers Streets being at the north-west corner of Shell House.\"\nThose three paragraphs are admitted by Dr van Wyk in paragraph 1.5 on page 96.  Mosselson say that they can't admit or deny it.  Again, we would submit that having regard to the evidence that was given and the information that would be easily ascertainable in relation to 11 and 12, Mosselson say that they had not instructions in 11 to 12.  May I indicate that this document was served on the 16th of April and no instructions have yet been obtained.  \n\tParagraph 13 on page 9,\n\"That the portion of King George Street between De Villiers Street and Plein Street, adjacent to Shell House on its western side, had a number of substantial concrete barricades spread across the road both at its northern and its southern points, which barricades rendered the passage by large number of people patently it difficult and unsuitable.\"\nThis is partly admitted and partly denied on page 96, paragraph 1.6, they say that,\n\"The objectors admit that there were some concrete barriers spread across the road in King George Street, at the corner of King George Street and De Villiers Street and at the corner of King George Street and Plein Street but would not admit that these barricades rendered the passage by a large number of people patently difficult and unsuitable.\"\nMay I indicate, Mr Chairman, that there is a plan of the area which is being referred to.

And the reason why we believe that his evidence is to be treated differently and that it should go in as uncontested facts is because of the following, at page 85 of these arguments before the inquest, it is said,\nthe evidence of Mr Ralph von Eggedy, 6.1:\n\"It is submitted that the witness Von Eggedy is an independent witness who, on the evidence, has no motive to lie and/or falsely implicate any person or group.  As a result it follows that strong reliance can be placed on the evidence of this witness for purposes of the findings of this Honourable Court.\"\nWe agree, Mr Chairman, and because of that, in bundle B we have incorporated - if you have a look at bundle B at 110, you will see a drawing and a statement by Mr von Eggedy going on to page 113 and 114.  This statement came into - although made shortly after the event, Mr Chairman, was only brought forth by the police who had it for some time whilst the inquest was in motion. \tIn the evidence led Mr Chairman, there was reference by our witnesses to a white person that tried to stop the marchers but we didn't know his identity.  However, the evidence on a video did show a person who did what we had said he had tried to do.  The learned Judge then called for this person to be found.  This was given publicity, and the person came forward and said: \"This is me.  I made the statement shortly after the event\".  The learned Judge then asked the Attorney-General's office to take a statement from him which you find at page 115 - 121, I beg your pardon, 122.  This was taken by one of the counsel in the Attorney-General's office Mr Chairman.  He was then asked questions by the learned Judge and his evidence is to be found at page 123 right up to 158.  Mr Chairman, we consider this evidence to be reliable and we may say Mr Chairman, that he was questioned by the learned Judge. He was not cross-examined in the true sense of the word by any of the persons there.  My learned friend Mr Tipp asked a few questions on page 148, 149, 150 and up to the top of page 152.  He was then asked questions, by our learned friend, Mr Dorfling, from page 152 - page 156, top of page 156, Mr Chairman.  \n\tNow, I want to read at the bottom of page 152.",

            "I'm merely saying Mr Chairman, the reason - we're characterising the nature of the evidence that we'll be able to give but we will go through the evidence at the end together with -  now the other matter Mr Chairman, that we want to deal with is this, that the issue of what information there was available to the leadership of the ANC and the guards from the evening of Sunday the 27th right up to shortly before the attack took place at 11h13 at Shell House.\n\tIn bundle A you will find from page 13, a summary of what appears and a detailed index of what appears on SAP channel 27.  That only starts at 07h38 on the morning of the 28th.  However, information as to what might or was likely to happen was available to the ANC leadership from the night before.  A number of affidavits were filed at the inquest proceedings including the affidavit of Mr Tokyo Sexwale in bundle B, pages 68 - 74 - there was more than one affidavit, Mr Chairman, from which it appears in point 2.1 that he had information that the ANC and PWB Regional Office in Shell House would come under attack.  In paragraph 4 at page 69 he communicated this to General Calitz because there was a query Mr Chairman - you will recall that paragraph 2 says what his information was and what the people were going to do,\n\"There was a query during the inquest proceedings as to whether I immediately telephoned General Koos Calitz at his home late in the afternoon to inform him of the above that that did not refer to paragraph 2.\"\nWe submit that it is a wrong interpretation of paragraph 4 but wanting to make it clear that that is what he meant.  On page 73 - 74 you will find a supplementary affidavit in which he spells out what he clearly meant.  He considers that he had clearly said in the previous affidavit but in any event the supplementary affidavit puts it beyond any doubt.\n\tThere is also on page 75 an affidavit by Nagede Matthews Phosa, who states that he had information which he conveyed to the then President of the ANC, Mr Nelson Mandela.  Mr Mandela's affidavit on page 47 to page 54 deals with the information that he received from Mr Phosa and others and that the steps that he took in order to prevent the widespread violence that the information indicated there was, and the steps that he took.  He phoned the then President of South Africa, Mr de Klerk, the Commissioner of Police, Mr van der Merwe. And Mr van der Merwe's statement is also in bundle B, pages 42 - 46.  There is a statement of Mr Joe Mtlandla on page 55 - 57, a statement from Mr Maduna on page 58 -62 and a supplementary statement from page 63 - 67.\n\tMr Chairman, Mr Mandela's statement we will also refer to in due course under another heading because we submit that the picture that he paints in his affidavit informs the Committee of what we may say is recent, if not present history, to the effect that the issue at the time was whether or not there would be a free and fair election or not, and - but we will refer to that.  I'm sure that every member of the Committee has lived through that history, it may not even be necessary to have evidence before it but it is there.  \n\tNow, that there was going to be difficulty Mr Chairman, that there were going to be difficulties, that is the information in the possession of the ANC, is also evidenced by a confidential report appearing on page 1 of bundle B.  The origin of that is from the files of the police, Mr Chairman, which was handed in into the inquest proceedings.  Firstly, Mr Chairman, we will draw attention to the fact in the first paragraph, that the information then available was that the IFP Transvaal, would organise originally a march for the 25th but the information then - there will be evidence that there was this information, but then it was changed to the 28th, paragraph 3, \n\"That the march is intended\"\nI'm translating to the best of my ability, Mr Chairman, paragraph 3: \n\"that the march is aimed of bringing about disruption in the city.\"\n\tThe other matter, Mr Chairman, is what happened during the morning from 07h38 on.  For this we refer you to page 13 of bundle A to page 76, Mr Chairman.  I do not intend reading this out Mr Chairman.  May I explain what the document is.  The police have a central radio facility to which policemen out in the field report.  A particular channel is indicated for particular events, channel 27 was chosen for this.  As I indicated earlier it was only disclosed in July when the inquest had been going on for a few months, and what you will see is the time and the report that is made and is recorded on a tape at the centre.

It will be open of course to our learned friends to go through it and add to it if they so wish but we intend to rely on it and particularly to those events described, that there was generalised public violence, death, injuries and destruction on a large scale.  The transcript is available, we have a copy of it in court.  We submit that we do not foresee that it will be necessary to burden the Committee with such a lengthy document but our learned friends we know have a copy or copies of this because it was made available at the inquest.\n\tThe one explanation that we want to give, Mr Chairman, is that you will see that it is in time sequence but what we want to indicate is that although it is given in hours and minutes, the time given is not necessarily the precise time in which the event occurred, it is the time which the report came in, so that when a police officer reports, he may have had to do something urgent in between, before going to his radio and saying, this is what has happened but we submit that it is a useful piece of evidence which is admissible as evidence as part of the - if we were in a court of law, as part of the ...[indistinct], but certainly is reliable and we submit, vital information for the Committee to have regard to.\n\tMr Chairman, the inquest held by His Lordship Mr Justice Nugent concerned only 19 of the deaths that occurred on that day.  It was established that over 50 people died in greater Johannesburg on that day and not only the 8 that died in the vicinity of Shell House.  These dockets and/or inquest records were and are in the possession of the Attorney-General.  \n\tWe have made a summary of those documents.  It was handed in at the inquest.  Our learned friends were given copies.  We have included it in bundle B from pages 197 - 253 and intend to make use of it as information tending to prove the nature and extent of this violence that this gathering and marches led to, from which we will ask the Committee to draw an inference as to what this large group of people were doing and intended to do at Shell House.  \n\tI do not intend, Mr Chairman, taking up anymore time in relation to this document.  Our learned friends had an opportunity to check what was - whether it accurately reflects what was in the Attorney-General's files and so on.  \n\tMr Chairman, we have also included in the file two newspaper cuttings, one containing a statement which if need be we will show, that Mr Ndlovu admitted to have been correctly reported.  It's to be found on page 85 and a newspaper report appearing on page 86 relating to a finding made public by the Goldstone Commission of Mr Themba Khoza's involvement in third force activities, all be it on a prima facie basis, Mr Chairman.   We will draw inferences from that, Mr Chairman.  \n\tWe will deal with -  Mr Chairman, there are also two videos recording Mr Themba Nkosa - I beg your pardon, Mr Humphrey Ndlovu and his attitude to violence and the possession of firearms.  There is a transcript of the one of a speech made in Vosloorus outside a hostel.

I merely wanted to indicate that on page - of this video, it is made clear on page 95 and 96 that no election is going to take place and that violence is going to be used to stop it.  That's all I need to say at this stage.  You will satisfy yourself in relation to the video and may I indicate that this speech was made at Library Gardens by Mr Ndlovu before the shooting at Shell House.\n\tMr Chairman, in order to lead a witness that is going to tell you in detail what happened, and although we were going to draw your attention to certain passages in Mr von Eggedy's evidence, we will leave that for the time being because you will have an opportunity to read it and judge the evidence given by the witnesses taken with it.  \n\tWhat the witnesses will tell you, Mr Chairman, is that once these two groups moved to the corner of De Villiers and King George Street, they were without police escort and notwithstanding Von Eggedy's efforts and the fact that the armed men of the ANC were fully visible, the crowds surged forward.  Von Eggedy described them as being on a full charge and intent to attack.  They were acting with a common purpose and they were in an aggressive, violent and attacking mode.  \tImmediately before they charged forward, the crowd was chanting and jeering in the way that Von Eggedy described as the kind that one would do to charge oneself up when one is charging.  Von Eggedy was overrun by a charging crowd, he was struck a number of times, he can be seen on the video material film shortly after the shooting with a good deal of blood running down his head.  \n\tThe two uniformed and armed policemen had also tried to stop the crowd, they had run up King George Street from where the ANC men were stationed, at the corner of Plein Street.  These two policemen were also roughly shoved aside.  One of them received a wound with a sharp instrument in the process.  May I say that large maps of the area have now become available and whilst the evidence is being led, the witness will indicate to you precisely on those large maps and the small ones that you have, both of the general area and particularly of that corner so that we may follow the evidence, Mr Chairman.  \n\tOur clients will say that the charge was accompanied by gunfire from the crowd.  In response to this, the ANC men on the parapet fired shots, those on street level also fired, warning shots were fired.  And then the first applicant, Gary Kruser, who was in command, gave the order to repel, shots were fired into the crowd.  Kruser gave the order to cease fire when it appeared to him that the charge had stopped.  \n\tIt must be appreciated Mr Chairman, that these events you will be told, took place very rapidly and under circumstances of great stress.  Although the applicants believe that they acted in a justifiable manner throughout there are objective indicators that they may not have been so.  Forensic evidence was presented in detail towards the end of the inquest, Mr Chairman.  This evidence has been, was agreed to by all the parties and you will find that in bundle B, page 156 - I beg your pardon, 159 right up to page 196.  \n\tNow, there is a report which is in Afrikaans, if there is any problem in it, the Committee will have to deal with it, we only have it in Afrikaans, Mr Chairman.  Then, you will see that from pages 180, 182 - 188 there are diagrams in colour on which the experts agreed shots came from and where they landed.  The Lancet Hall ballistics start at 190 - 196, and it's signed by all three experts.  This does not require further proof, we submit.  The report also refers to medical evidence because the ballistics was married to the medical evidence but the medical evidence itself is not before you, certain assumptions are made in the report, and we will deal with it in due course Mr Chairman, during the course of the evidence.",

Seven died as a result of gunshot wounds, one was stabbed with an assegai in the back.  It is clear that almost all of them were hit after they had turned away.  This is a fact which we accept Mr Chairman.  This objective evidence correlates also with the evidence of Von Eggedy that gunfire was continuing while those who had charged forward were retreating.  Shots were still ringing out from the direction of the ANC men while these people were running back.  \n\tAs set out in the supplementary affidavits filed by each of the applicants, the effect of this evidence has been explained to them.

This too would have contributed to the confusion of the situation.  \n\tMay I refer you to - if I may indicate by way of illustration, if you have a look at page 183 Mr Chairman, you will see the cluster of red lines from ground level onto the underside of the parapet at SW1, do you see that, Mr Chairman?",

You can imagine how much dust was kicked up and how much noise and panic this may have incurred, without the people actually around Mr Khumalo knowing where the shots that were kicking up that dust were coming from and we give it as an example of the confusion that was created.\n\tIt will also be shown, Mr Chairman, the ballistics will also show that two shots from a pistol were in fact fired into the ceiling in corroboration of Rama's evidence, which was - I beg your pardon, Kruser's evidence, was that he ordered him to fire two warning shots, and the ballistics will show that there were two pistol shots in fact against the under portion of the parapet or the counter-lever slam.  \n\tNow, for - what it boils down to is that the applicants accept that their belief and recollection what happened may not be fully correct.

In other words, whilst I'm in a jacking mode or running away, shot from behind, shot from the side, those particulars do indeed appear in the objector's affidavits.\n\tThen, Mr Bizos in the request for further particulars seeks the objectors to admit to certain facts, for example speeches of Mr Humphrey Ndlovu, radio transcripts which transpired between policemen and members of the ANC.

In particular, it answers all the questions raised by Mr Bizos.  Insofar as the grounds is concerned, he specifically set out the grounds as it appears from page 80 with reference to paragraph 4 and further.

Mr Chairman, I do not wish to read out the full affidavit, but it is there for the Committee.  \n\tInsofar as the admissions my learned friend sought us to make, I wish to state the following:  It is our specific instructions as is set out in affidavits as well as in the affidavit of Dr van Wyk, that the objectors who we appear for were approached by the Indunas, the Zulu Indunas and informed them of a gathering on behalf of the King or in support of the King.  They reacted to that request and they wished to attend this meeting on behalf of their King.  \n\tThey do no, or they are not aware of the applications made by members of the IFP and furthermore, are not aware and were not aware at least, of speeches referred to by my learned friend, Mr Bizos.

It is appropriate here to re-iterate in particular that I did not at any time intend to bring about the unlawful killing of or injury to anyone.  I still believe that at the time I gave the order to repel, the marchers were in the process of attacking Shell House with the intention of damaging it and killing and injuring as many of its occupants as possible, including members of the leadership of the ANC.  However, I do accept that certain aspects of the objective ballistic and medical evidence presented during the inquest are in conflict with portions of my evidence, in particular, I accept that most of the deceased were shot after they had turned back and that the gunfire which I heard coming from the marchers and which I believed was fired in my direction, was directed elsewhere.  I accept further that one or more of the marchers may have been killed or injured as a result of my order to repel.  Particulars concerning such persons do not fall within my personal knowledge.  I understand that my legal representatives have for some time attempted to obtain particulars about injured persons from their legal representatives, but without success.\n\t9.\tI believe when I gave the order to repel and when I gave evidence in the joint inquest that the shooting was justified, that it was not excessive and that my order was to cease fire was given timeously.  However, I have been advised by my legal representatives that the criminal or civil court may find otherwise and hold that my actions were neither justified nor reasonable in the circumstances.  Albeit on a prima facie basis, the Inquest Court has already done so.  Accordingly I request that if the Amnesty Committee is satisfied that my acts or omissions constitute an offence and/or the delict of wrongfully and negligently bringing about the death or the injury to on one or more of the marchers, I be granted amnesty in respect thereof.\"\nDo you confirm the correctness of your supplementary affidavit?",

I worked and was deployed in the position where I had to defend the ANC, its constitution, its leadership and its members, that was my function and my deployment.\n\tThe ANC at that stage was preparing itself for the first democratic election in this country.  Part of my responsibility over and above my normal responsibilities was to ensure that we have proper security for elections, that's one of the reasons why we purchased the firearms.  I was also aware of the immense rivalry between the ANC and the IFP at that stage and the concerted efforts by the IFP to ensure that the elections would not take place.  \n\tAs I stated earlier, at the time when I gave the order to repel the marchers I had in my mind my political responsibility towards the ANC, its building, its people and its leaders and also the upcoming election which was about to take place.  So I had no doubt in my mind, if they invaded the building and killed members of the ANC and leaders of the ANC that the historic election which took place in this country would not have taken place at that time.  And therefor I think my political objectives was in line with my political responsibilities to defend the ANC.",

Therefor it's been very painful, not only for me, but also for my colleagues.  It's something that we unfortunately are going to have to live with till the day we die.\n\tWe regret not only the loss of these lives, but the loss of all lives that was lost on that day and I think through the history of the struggle of this country.
