Before I proceed with any of the other objectors, in order to expedite the proceedings, there is one aspect I want to clarify with the Committee, especially in the light of certain statements that were made yesterday, in order to clarify my own position.\n\tFirstly, in respect of Mr Ntombela, my colleague Mr Berger, stated to you that Mr Ntombela was probably shot with an AK-47 from a flat above Nandos, and secondly, refer you to bundle `B' page 185 of bundle `B', in respect of shots 17 and 18, that Mr Ntombela could have been shot from that AK-47.\n\tAnd then secondly, Mr Bizos stated in the examination of the mother, he had put it to her that this deceased was not shot and killed by any of the ANC guards.  And then thirdly, in respect of the approach of Mrs Moraka, on behalf of the ANC, that there was no evidence that Mr Chonco was shot by the ANC, and in response to a direct question to Mr Simelane, that is not applying for Amnesty in respect of Chonco.\n\t  I just want to clarify that I understand the present position to be, and I accepted that there is no Application in respect of any guard, who had fired a shot and who had killed Mr Ntombela.  In other words, I accepted that there is an Application for Amnesty for any of the Applicants, which caused the death of Mr Veli Tombela and, if that is the position, I do not intend calling any further witnesses in respect of that deceased.",

So, we will persist in the Application and my learned friend can advise himself as to what further evidence, if any, he wants to lead in that regard.\n\tMr Chonco is on a different basis because we contend that the evidence clearly shows that he was not shot with a shotgun.

I accept that at all times Mr Bizos has got instructions to make statements to Mrs Ntombela.\n\tHe had put it to her that she was not, in fact, shot and killed by one of the ANC guards.   Then it is not clear how come they can apply for Amnesty because it was taken up with the mother, this morning, and she approached me with an attitude, that it had been put to her, her son was not killed by any of the guards.
