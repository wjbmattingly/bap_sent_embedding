The vehicle then proceeded very slowly and stopped at our roadblock.  We ordered the passengers to climb out, they were searched and we told them to sit down on a small embankment on the side of the road while the vehicle was being searched.\n\tOnce again I posed the questions to the people, where they came from, where they were going, to which political party they belonged.  Phil Kloppers walked on after them and if someone didn't want to answer he gave them a slight hit with the baton.  Many of them or most of them answered that they were ANC members.  \n\tAfter that I called Etienne van Zyl and Jaco Badenhorst who were deployed to watch for vehicles.  We decided that this would be the correct target to shoot at.  We stood in a line, I fired the first shot, that would be the signal that the others should commence shooting.\n\tEveryone except Kallie Meiring, Gert Diedericks and Andre Visser fired at the people.  Kallie Meiring couldn't fire because he was position in such a manner that he had to watch for those who would attempt to run away into the veld.

Some of the men jumped into the Sentra and then sped off in the direction of Randfontein.  Kloppers still shouted after them to meet at the City Hall.  It then came to light that a vehicle was not approaching and Gert Diedericks approached with a flashlight.  \n\tWe held in over the people who were lying there very still, it appeared as if they were dead.
