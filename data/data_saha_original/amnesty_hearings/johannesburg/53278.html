<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll proceed with the other one now.  Mr Duma, which language would you prefer to use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MXOLISI DUMA:</span> Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Motepe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> We will follow the same procedure as we followed in the first one.  I've already presented the supplementary affidavit and we have nothing further to add.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabete?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair, just a few questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>	You say you were requested by Mr Mpo Tseklo(?) to transport his fellow comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Who was Mr Mpo Tseklo and did he belong to any political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes, he was an ANC member, Mpo Tseklo, in Meadowlands, Zone 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Besides being a member of the ANC, did he hold any position, was he involved in any activities, was he an active member, can you just give us more information about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes, Mpo Tseklo was an ANC follower and an activist and he was at school at the time, involved in the school activities as well and the in the forefront in the struggle matters inasfar as school environment was concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Did you say he was an ANC follower or supporter or a member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> He was an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Why were you specifically chosen to transport these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Mpo chose me because he knew me and I also had a car at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Sorry, were you a member or a follower of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> I was a follower at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Were you a card-carrying member?  Sorry, are you saying you were a follower?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes, I was a follower.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Before he chose you to transport his fellow comrades, did he used to involve you in other operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Although I would not refer to them as operations, but he would refer people to come to me for transport, to assist in things like funerals and things like that which required transport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Did you know these comrades that you had to transport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> No, I did not know them.  I wasn't quite used to them as such, but I knew them by sight.  Mpo is the one who told me one of them, the name of one of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> What was the name of that person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Shakes was the name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Do you know where he was from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes, he also resided in Meadowlands, Zone 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> And were you told what they were going to do where you were transporting them to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes, that was told to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> What were they going to do there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> They were going to fetch firearms, guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Exactly where were the arms that they were going to fetch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Those guns were fetched from Booysen, a certain place in Booysen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Was it in a house?  Where was this place situated where you had to go and get these firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> When we got to Booysen I parked the car next to a scrap yard and they alighted from the car and went inside the scrap-yard and came back after a few minutes with bags full of arms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Would you be in a position to know where these firearms came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> As to where they were coming from no, I don't know and as to how they got there I don't know as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Cam you briefly tell us how you were caught?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> We were arrested on our way back to Soweto with these firearms in the car.  As we approached a certain stop there were police there and they tried to stop us and we stopped.  In fact they stopped us, we stopped and they wanted to - they didn't stop us ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> A point of rectification - we were being stopped, but I did not stop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> I was convicted for unlicensed ammunition and in possession, because I was found also in possession of unlicensed firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> As a person who has applied for amnesty, how would you justify your having transported people to go and fetch arms for the ANC?  How would you justify that politically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> There is a correlation between what I did and the political aspect because the violence was rife in the area where we resided and people were killed, attacked left right and centre.   Most of the being who were being attacked and killed were ANC members being attacked by the organisation, IFP, together the police.  Now those things resulted to the community deciding and together with the comrades deciding that we should be able to obtain firearms or weapons rather, to protect the community.  Now that is how this is related to politics, my actions that is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair,  no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETE</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Motepe, have you got anymore questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> I don't have anymore questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOTEPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> On page 68 of the bundle, paragraph 10(a) you say that your political objective was to defend the communities of Meadowlands and Mzimshlope, why did you feel called upon to defend those communities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> To defend the community was a right to every affected party, that something must be done to protect the attacks, the community from attacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> So that what you chose to do, you chose of your own volition to defend these communities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes, on my own volition I did choose to defend the community of South Africa at large because we were being oppressed at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> When you were asked to transport these people, were you paid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> No, I wasn't paid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> You say you wanted to defend the communities of Meadowlands and Mzimshlope, how were you going to defend these communities?  I still don't understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> In a way of availing my car to be used for such activities to obtain things that will help us to be able to defend the community, weapons, things like weapons that would have been used by people defending, or in a mission of defending the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Were you employed at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> No, I was self-employed, I was not employed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> What work were you doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> We had at home a fast-food outlet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> For what are you actually applying for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> I'm applying for amnesty for, especially as we are aware that we are living in a new era here in South Africa, the apartheid has since died and it was a result of apartheid that these things happened and that is in the past now, we are living in the present and the future and we are preaching the gospel of reconciliation here in the country, South Africa that is.  I deemed it fit and appropriate for me to come forward and disclose all the truth to the community of South Africa through this vehicle of TRC, so that they may know better as to what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think you misunderstand my question, I didn't ask why you are applying for amnesty, I'm asking in respect of what offences.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> In respect of my conviction.  I'm in prison now and I'm coming forward ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What, what crime?  What do you want us to do, grant you amnesty for what, in respect of what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Grant me amnesty because I've been convicted for going to fetch the firearms and attempted murder of some policemen.  Those are the acts I'm seeking amnesty for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now that's what I'm getting at.  Most of your testimony concerned the transportation of all these weapons, tell us more about this attempted murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> To explain briefly, when I was being convicted at the court of law with regard to these cases that I've referred to, they gave me 5 years for attempted murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did you commit this attempted murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> It was not me who attempted to murder, but people in my company that did that, who were shooting at the police, the people I was transporting.  Because ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> While you were escaping from the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> It is because we had firearms concealed in our car and they were not licensed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Duma, listen to the question, I'm trying to help you, I'm not trying to catch you out.  You were part of a group of people, some of whom shot at the police, do I understand you correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All I'm asking is, was that the time you were driving that motor vehicle escaping from these police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes, I was driving this vehicle when I was escaping from the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So although you never actually shot yourself, you were part of that group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You accepted responsibility for everything that happened on that trip, do I understand you correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you needed these weapons, as far as you were concerned, to defend that community and therefore the police were shot at?  You couldn't allow the police to get hold of those weapons, is that the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes, that was the position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was only one count of attempted murder that you were convicted of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did that happen, not the conviction, the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> That happened in 1990, November.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> November.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes, November.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you were transporting weaponry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes, I was asked to transport people who were going to fetch weapons at that particular time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that was successful, you did collect weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes, we did a successful, except for the time when we came across the policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So when you came across the policemen there were weapons in the car?  That is how I understand your application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you I understand you correctly that when you were asked to assist by transport, you willingly agreed and that was your contribution to the political struggle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes, because I knew the people who were asking me this and I also knew their involvement in the community and I agreed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When the police tried to stop your car, you drove past, you didn't accede to that command, do I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> When the police tried to stop the car one of the people inside said: "There are the police, don't stop in case they stop you", and indeed I drove past.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now if you knew it was the police yourself, without being told, would you have stopped or would you have driven on on your own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> As for me I wouldn't have stopped because at the time police were not faithful, I mean you could not trust police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was your sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> I was given 8, 9 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 5 for attempted murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Two for possession of firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And 2 for possession of ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Very true, Your Honour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were they ordered to run concurrently or were they separate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> May you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were those separate sentences ordered to run concurrently or were they kept separate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Different times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you're only serving that - I see you're in prison clothes, are you still serving that particular 9 year sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes, 9 years is part of the entire sentence that I'm serving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you serving other parts of sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  What for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> The one case that I was convicted for was being suspected of robbing the bank and attempting to steal a car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Those are independent acts, separate from your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR DUMA:</span> Yes, those had nothing to do with this amnesty application.  The other 10 years is still on appeal at court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Yes thank you, you are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any other bits of evidence, Mr Motepe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> No extra evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabete, have you got any evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> No evidence, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are we done with the evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> We are, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Motepe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE IN ARGUMENT:</span> Committee Members, in this particular case one doesn't need to dwell much into the argument because most of the points have been raised, the link to the political objectives and they clearly qualify under the Act, so one doesn't need really to dwell much on this.  That is all I wish to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you deal with one aspect.  He's made application in his, if I may term it "man in the street" way in respect of unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition, but he may be guilty of some other offences covered by the Arms and Ammunition Act, for example transporting and distribution maybe.  Do you think we can include that should we lean towards granting amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> I think that will be proper in case in future such charges might be brought against him, that that will be proper now to deal with even though it was not specifically mentioned, but they are tied together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja, ja.  It will be based on the same facts, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTEPE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>MACHINE SWITCHED OFF</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabete, have you any argument?</p>

<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is your attitude towards the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Mr Chair, my attitude is that from the evidence of the applicant clearly it appears that he associated himself with the members of the community who were protecting the community and by providing transport it was his contribution.  And for the charges that he has been convicted of he has associated himself with it and my attitude would be to have no objection if amnesty were to be granted.</p>
