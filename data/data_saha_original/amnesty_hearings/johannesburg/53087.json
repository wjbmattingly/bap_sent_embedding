            "In 1993 in Thokoza Extension 2 we were an Danger Zone near the hostel.  The commander came, his name is Ben.  He told us about Sibongele, that Sibongele was with the IFP.  As a commander, we didn't ask him too many questions and so he ordered us to go and kill Sibongele together with her sibling, I don't know the sibling's name.  We went there together with other comrades, Mogoera, Vuyisile, Jango, Mavi, Mdmase, Doctor, Joseph and others, I don't remember their names because it was too many of us.  We went to Sibongele's place.  Sibongele escaped to Extension 5.  We found her there at Extension 5.  We brought her back.  When we brought her back we went to her place and collected her sibling and Ben ordered us to go and kill her at Unit F at a certain Danger Zone near the hostel.\n\tWhen we were on our way Ben stopped us, myself, Mogoera and Vuyisile.  He told us not continue to Danger Zone because we didn't have firearms.  When we were there we looked for another safe place and Ben returned back home.  We waited there to hear firearms or fire shots.  We were surprised because we didn't hear anything until one comrade came, his name was Siphiwe.  When he arrived there he asked us why we were waiting there.  We explained everything to him, we told him that we were waiting for comrades because we were waiting for comrades to shoot Sibongele.  He asked us why we were not at the danger zone so that we see when they kill Sibongele.  We told him that we couldn't because we didn't have guns.  He took one Makarof and gave it to me and he said to me I must go there and see what was going on.\n\tI went there with Vuyisile, he left behind with Mogoera.  On our way Doctor came and he was running.  We asked him as to where were the other comrades.  He told us that they were busy that side and when I asked him \"busy doing what?\" he continued telling us that they were busy raping Sibongele and her sibling and I got mad because it wasn't the way to go about it.  \n\tMe and Vuyisile ran to that place.  When we arrived there surely Mdmase and another guy, his name is Mavi, they were busy raping them.  Because there were too many comrades there, some of them were inside the yard and some were inside the house.  When I arrived there I took out that Makarof and I pointed the gun to the comrades to shoot them and I missed them and Sibongele's sibling got shot and my gun had only four bullets and then I shot Sibongele and Sibongele's sibling was down, she tried to grab me and then I shot at her with that one remaining bullet.  As I was walking outside Mdmase was waiting there, I asked Mdmase to finish them with that AK47 and I heard that gunfire and I told myself that Mdmase has finished them and I went to Spruit to report and the next day they were called and they were shambokked.
