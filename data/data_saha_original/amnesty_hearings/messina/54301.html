<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Koopedi</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR KOOPEDI:</span> Mr Mbuli I'm showing to you an application form.  Chairperson that's on page 29 of the bundle of documents.  Is this your application form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> And on page 34 of the said bundle, there's a signature appearing just above the word "Deponent", would this be your signature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, it's mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Is it correct that you are an applicant in this matter that involves the landmines in the Messina area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now, at any stage were you a member of a political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, I was a member of the ANC and its military wing, Umkhonto weSizwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> When and where did you join the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I joined the ANC in 1981 in Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Did you receive any military training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I did receive my military training in Angola and the Soviet Union and Tanzania.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now, you've heard the evidence of your co-applicant Mr Nondula, who says that you were part or you belonged to the unit together, do you confirm this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, it's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now he also went on to say that upon infiltration, this unit was broken into two groups, one led by Chilies and one led by Agrippa, can you confirm this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, the unit was divided and I belonged to Chilies' group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now would you briefly tell this Honourable Committee what your group did from the time you crossed the border into the country, into South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, just before you proceed, Mr Mbuli, do you know what Chilies' real name was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No, that was the nom de guerre, Chilies, I don't know his real name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You've never learned it, even now as you sit now you don't know it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And is he still alive, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No, he died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Koopedi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  I had asked you to briefly tell this Honourable Committee what your group did, part of this unit did from the time your crossed into the country, South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Ja, as a unit of twelve we were assigned a mission, as my comrade has already mentioned what was the mission and we decided no, we have to divide because the unit was too big.  The other unit will be under - the other six will be under Chilies and the other six will be under Agrippa.  Then we stayed a night before because it was late, in Zimbabwe, then we crossed the following day, it was a Monday, if I recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>	Then the whole night we planted the landmines in the area shown on our maps, then the following morning, the early hours of the morning which will be around five, then we crossed back to Zimbabwe because we were given strict orders.  That mission should be a fast mission.  You go and come back and it's what we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now how many mines, landmines did your group plant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> We planted six landmines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> And these are the mines that took you the greater part of the night to plant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Immediately thereafter, you say in the early hours of the morning, you went back to Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Ja, we went back to Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Would I then be correct to say that you were inside the country, carried your operation only for that night, one night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now in the process of planting these landmines, were you in a position to decide where a landmine should be planted, you personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No, not personally but the Commander decided that no, we'll plant the mine here and we'll have to do that, it was an order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now, in as far as you know, which of your landmines exploded, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No, I won't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Would you know which victims were injured or killed by the landmines that were planted by your group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I won't say that no, mentioning the name that no, it's this person who was, who detonated our mine, but I know that the mines in that area were detonated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson, that will be the evidence-in-chief for this applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KOOPEDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wagener, do you have any questions you'd like to put to the applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR WAGENER:</span> Sir, your written application has been referred to you by your lawyer, pages 29 to 35, correct, of the bundle, that's your application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Can you repeat it again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Is this your application, page 29 to 35 of the bundle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> And you took the oath when signing this document that this is the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Do you still say so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, I'm still saying that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> For which incidents do you apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I applied for the mines exploded in that area which the bigger unit was operating.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> The which unit, sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said the bigger unit was operating, in other words are you saying that you apply for amnesty in respect of the mines laid by the twelve of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> But the way I understand your evidence, you were not involved in some of the incidents, your smaller group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> They were not involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Your group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Was not involved in all these incidents, why do you apply then for amnesty for all those incidents, I'm not sure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I don't understand you Sir, when you say my unit was not involved because we are a bigger unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Were you involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, I was involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> In the landmine that killed the family of my client Mr van Eck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, I was involved as a bigger unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Were you yourself involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, I was involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> In this landmine that killed the family of my client?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what Mr Wagener's asking is, were you personally, yourself, physically, personally involved in the planting of the landmine that killed members of the van Eck family, yourself personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Sir, I will say as a member of the unit I was involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I understand what you're saying, but what Mr Wagener's asking is, do you know whether you were personally involved in the actual laying of that specific actual mine that blew up the van Eck family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I won't know because we operated in a very big area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wagener.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Can I come in here?  The unit consisting of twelve members, did it have a name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> These two units consisting of six members each, did they have names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wagener.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Why I'm asking you this, if you have a look at page 31 of the bundle, in the middle of the page you say that the victims of your actions were, you refer to a van der Eck family, I assume you wish to refer to the van Eck family and you refer to a labourer, Mr Ndlovu, those were the victims of your actions.  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, Sir, in "expantiating" on this one, as I've earlier mentioned that no, as a unit, the thing which I came with this name, it was because of Mr van der Eck appeared on the TV, that no he wants to see the people who were involved in the laying of the mines.  I didn't know that no, Mr van der Eck, in which area where we were operating this thing, he stays.  No on that background, that's why I included Mr van der Eck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what Mr Wagener's getting at, you've in your application form at page 30, you've singled out the van Eck family and Mr Ndlovu.  We know that besides those people, the van Ecks and Mr Ndlovu, there were other victims from the same campaign of laying landmines, for instance the De Nysschen family.  Why did you just mention these two names and not all the victims of all the explosions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I know of this name from the newspapers which came out after, on the funeral, when Mr van der Eck was addressing the funeral, when he was out of the hospital, I started knowing and Mr Ndlovu's name, I also took it from there that also he was a victim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wagener.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Will you accept that Mr Nondula, the previous applicant, he was convicted for the two incidents that you, in your written application, seem to apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> But now you say that is wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No, I'm not saying that is wrong, we were a unit.  Mr Nondula, my comrade, he was arrested, I was not arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> But were you part of the same six?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Of the same twelve.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> But not the same six?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Not the same six.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> So you were not involved in the two incidents that you refer to on page 31, or am I mistaken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I mean what Nondula he has applied and what he appeared this thing in Court for because he was shown the areas where this thing he operated, I mean it's according to the evidence which Nondula gave.  Me, I applied on the basis of people who got killed in the area because of the mines I laid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Were you in the same smaller unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said he wasn't the same as Nondula.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Yes.  Were you in the same smaller unit as Mr Mncube?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> He's not applying for these incidents that you refer to on page 31.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I don't know, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Because he was not involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I don't know, that he will answer himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> When your unit of twelve, when you were briefed in Zimbabwe, I take it, by whom were you briefed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> We were briefed by Mancheck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Is that Julius Maliba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I don't know that name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Was he the chairman of the Zimbabwe Regional Politico Military Committee, Julius Maliba, alias Mancheck?  is that the person we refer to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> If they say he's Julius Maliba, alias Mancheck, that's him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Chairman, I'm reading from the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ANC submissions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> The May submission, page 54 on the Zimbabwe structure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Page 54, I'll just write that down.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> That's right.  What did he say?  What were you supposed to do on this mission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> When he brief us, he told us of that area, those areas next to the border line, Soutpansberg specifically, as the military area.  That the community around there, it's organised into Commando structures, the rural Commando structures and our mission is to lay mines and the mines we had were the ...(indistinct) mines.  We took the order and we simply did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Where were you supposed to lay the mines?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> On the patrol roads.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Only the patrol roads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Only patrol roads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, the patrol roads.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> So, if your colleague, Mr Nondula, and his unit laid mines not patrolled by the military, were they not following the orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Can you repeat that Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> I asked you, you said your orders were to lay mines on the roads patrolled by the military, okay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Now I ask you, so if the other unit of Mr Nondula laid mines on roads not used by the military, were they acting outside the orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Nondula, he didn't say that this thing ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> I'm asking you, I'm asking you now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No, I won't answer for Nondula.  If you ask me about my unit, I think that will be okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Yes.  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Us, we laid mines in the patrol roads used by the military.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Well, I'm asking you if the other sub-unit laid mines not on roads used by the military, were they acting outside the orders given to the big unit?  That's my question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Nondula said they laid mines in the patrol roads, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Yes, but I'm asking you and you're not answering my question.  If evidence will show that they planted mines on roads not used by the military, were they acting outside the orders of this Mancheck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> That will be difficult for me to answer for somebody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> But you were present when the orders were given to the twelve of you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Well then you can answer the question.  It shouldn't be difficult.  It's a simple question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Okay, I'll simply say this, Sir.  When we were given order, they said the area, it's organised into rural Commandos.  Everybody who's there is attached to this structure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Are you serious with that answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, I'm serious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> So the black labourers on the farms, were they also part of the structure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I'll say sorry Sir for the labourer who was a victim of our actions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> But were they a target as well, these labourers?  Were they targets of yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No, we were not specifically aiming at certain individuals, we were only attacking.  We laid the mines to the patrol road.  If the labourer he drove on top of this thing when he was driving through the patrol road, that's why I'm saying, I'm sorry for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> But we've now had a long debate and you still haven't answered my question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Sir, what's your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> For the fourth time, the question is, you were present when Mancheck gave instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> And you told us that the instructions were that mines should be laid on roads used by the military.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Now the question is, if the other sub-unit, group of six, laid mines on roads not used by the military, were they acting outside these orders given by Mancheck?  That's the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I think I've answered that one, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> No you haven't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No, I've answered that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Was it a yes or a no?  You haven't answered the question, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I've answered it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Well, repeat your answer please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We don't need to, we've heard what he's said Mr Wagener, perhaps you can carry on asking, but we don't need to have it repeated, we've got it written down here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Chairman, maybe I'm then a stupid lawyer, but I didn't hear what he said as being an answer to my question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It wasn't in a yes or no form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Well it was no answer at all to the question put.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, well you can use that in argument, we don't have to have him repeating what he's just said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> When you returned to Zimbabwe immediately after this operation, to whom did you report back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> We reported back to Mancheck Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Where was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> That was in Bulawayo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Was that where this structure, the Regional Politico Military Committee as seated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No, they came to see us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Who came to see you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Mancheck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> And who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No, it's Mancheck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Sorry, I thought you said "they", that's why I'm asking the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Oh maybe it's my mistake, it's the one who came to see us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Were you present when a report-back was made to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> What was reported back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I mean everything was on the news Sir, the only thing was to thank us for the mission well done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> But isn't it correct that some of these mines only exploded weeks later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Ja, but the first mines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Yes.  So you referred to, I think there were four incidents about on the 26th and the 27th of November, I think there were about four incidents.  You refer to those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Ja, the first mines which exploded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, what were those dates, Mr Wagener?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Chairman, I have it that the first two incidents took place on 26th November and another three took place the next day, the 27th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  Mr Mbuli, approximately what date did you lay those mines, taking into account that the first one was set off on the 26th of November?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Ja it was on - the first mines exploded on the 26th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes and then now, how long before that were they actually laid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How long before that were they actually laid on the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> They were laid in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Of the?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Of the 26th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, so it was the same night?  Okay, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> The other group of six, did they report back in Zimbabwe the same time as your group of six?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No, they followed later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> How much later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I don't remember.  It should be after a week or so after we had arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Were they in the country for about a week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Were they in the country for about a week, laying their mines?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> They were in the country I think for two days, then they went to Zimbabwe, then there was another walking involved in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> The two groups of six each, did they enter the country on the same day together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes we entered together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> The same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Now we know that two of these mines exploded only on the 12th of December, the one and the other on the 15th of December 85, we know that.  That is approximately two weeks after they were laid, will you accept that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Even up to three weeks, the 15th to the 26th of November is closer to three weeks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Ja.  Ja, even up to three weeks, will you accept that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, Sir, I will.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> So, if I understand you correctly, these mines were lying there underground for more than two weeks before they were detonated by a vehicle going over them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Does that mean that the road was not used by a vehicle for the same period, about two weeks?  How would you comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Ja in that one Sir, I will say maybe the detonation unit of the Government then, failed to discover those mines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what Mr Wagener's asking you, the fact that a mine was only detonated - sorry was this mine unintentionally detonated, the one on the 15th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Well that is the one that killed the van Eck family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, it wasn't done by the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was unintentionally detonated.  The fact that a mine was unintentionally detonated three weeks after it was laid, does that mean necessarily that that road was not used by a vehicle for three weeks?  In other words between the time the mine was laid and the mine went off three weeks later, it meant that another vehicle didn't use that road in that period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Ja, I will say that Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> It means it was not used until the other car detonated it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> And you also said a minute or so ago, that these specific mines, in other words mines that detonated 12 and 15 December, they were not found by the explosives or the mine searching personnel of the Defence Force.  Are you aware that they were looking for these mines on the roads in that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Ja because I mean it's an obvious case.  They will be looking for mines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Ja.  Now why do you think were they unable to locate these mines not on a much earlier date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I wouldn't know, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Isn't it obvious that they were not searching on these specific roads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I may have a different answer for that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> It's true, they were not searching on these specific roads.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Well, I can say they've passed it when they checked, they didn't notice it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Mr Chairman, I'm not sure, I see it's half-past four nearly, I'm not sure what you intend doing this afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'd like to do as much as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Okay, can we continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Will you accept, Mr Mbuli, that this landmine campaign was a total failure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> It was a total failure on what, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Well, the intended targets were not hit.  It's a known fact that 90% plus of the victims were civilians, innocent civilians.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I mean it's my first time to see those statistics from you Sir, of that no, there were 24 people, civilians, who died and one in the Security Forces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Ja.  Do you dispute that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I mean, it's what I'm saying that no, it's for the first time Sir to hear those statistics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Well, will you accept that your President Mr Tambo, became concerned that this campaign, to a large extent, only targeted innocent civilians and therefore he called it off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> What I know that no, the late President, Oliver Tambo, he did mention that no, this landmine campaign must stop, the majority becomes civilians, I mean that was the - I will say that was the news from the newspaper, that was the bulletin from the newspapers, that was the only information - that was the only source of information ...(indistinct).  Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> For what it's worth, Mr Chairman, I'm reading from page 327 of your bundle, in the left-hand column, the fourth paragraph.  In other words, the high echelon, or the Command Structure of the ANC realised that the targets intended to be hit, were not hit, namely the military, during the course of your - operations like yours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> But in our operation, what I know, that I successfully operated in that particular area.  An order which I was given, I fulfilled them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Yes.  No I accept that what you say is you followed orders, I accept that, but that your mission was a failure in terms of ANC policy and general instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Is that a question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Yes, that was what I put to you, do you want to comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> That the ANC said it was a failure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Ja.  Anyway, if you don't want to - your unit of six,</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Were they involved in prior reconnaissance before planting the landmines?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Chilies was involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> How do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Ja, because he left us and he went for reconnaissance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> When?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> It should be around August/September somewhere there of 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> And were you in possession of a map when you - of a map specifying the locations of where bombs, mines had to be planted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> What happened to this map?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> The map?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> It has to be returned back to ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Did you see the map?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Ja, when everything was planned, it was planned, when we were briefed, we were briefed on the basis of that map that no, we'll operate in this area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> And the other group of six, did they also have a map?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Do you know that or are you speculating?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No we are a same group, when we were briefed we were briefed together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But when you went on the actual mission, when you crossed over into the country and split into two groups, did you still have a map?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> So were you supposed to enter the country and find the exact roads by night without a map and to know then where to plant the mines?  Is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No we are saying that Chilies as the person who was on the reconnaissance, he's the one who went fro reconnaissance, he knows the area, we relied on his knowledge of the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> And was it the same with the other group of six with their leader, apparently Agrippa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Agrippa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Was it the same there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I think it was the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Who gave the overall instruction for your operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> It was Mancheck, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Wasn't it the National Executive Committee of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I mean this thing, as you earlier mentioned that what role Mancheck was in that Zimbabwe Front, he's the one who gives us the instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> But didn't this instruction come from ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Automatically ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Sorry.  Sorry, you were saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> That simply means Mancheck gets his orders from the higher echelon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> What is the higher echelon in your book?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> That will be the National Executive Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> So the National Executive Committee gave the instructions for this landmine campaign?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Pardon, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> So the National Executive Committee gave the instructions for the landmine campaign, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Ja because us, we were given orders as the footsoldiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know whether the National Executive Committee gave orders to Mancheck, or are you assuming it?  Do you have personal knowledge where Mancheck got his orders from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I'm assuming that he got it from the National Executive Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> But on page 33 of the bundle, you state as a fact, if you want to have a look it's there with your lawyer, you state as a fact, that's the way I read your application at least, that the order or approval came from the National Executive Committee.  Do you see that there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Yes, Sir, I see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Is that your firm belief that that's how it happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Ja, because any order to a footsoldier, it must come from the National Executive Committee of the ANC, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Before you embarked on this operation, were you at any stage told that your operation had the blessing of the National Executive Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> Before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Ja, before you embarked, before you came to South Africa on this operation, were you told:  "You needn't worry, the National Executive Committee had authorised or approved your mission", or is this merely an assumption?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> I mean as a footsoldier Sir, I only receive orders, I don't question orders, because I take it for granted that the orders come from the higher ...(indistinct), yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Had you at any stage after this operation met the Chief of your army, Mr Joe Modise?  Have you met him personally?  After this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> After this operation?</p>

<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Did any other senior member of your Command Structure, apart from this Mancheck, discuss this operation with you afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBULI:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Till today?</p>
