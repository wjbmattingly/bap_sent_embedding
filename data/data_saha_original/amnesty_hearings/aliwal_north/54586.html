<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you. Can you just speak up a little bit so that we, we, maybe Mr Mthembu can you just move that microphone a little bit closer to you please.  That's fine.  That's perfect.  Perhaps you can try again, Mr Mthembu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Makoala, is it correct that you have read the affidavit of Mr Dolo.  Are you going to confirm certain paragraphs contained therein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I suppose that you confirm paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the referred affidavit of Mr Dolo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes I will do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> But my question is whether you will confirm the said paragraphs, or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I know about them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> And you confirm them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I do confirm that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If we could also have, confirm something else.  Where you the person known as Kleintjie?  Kleintjie was referred to in those paragraphs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I am Kleintjie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Now, can one briefly to tell the Committee about your involvement in this incident.  Just briefly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> May you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Briefly tell the Committee of your involvement or your roll in this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What happened on that day is we were four, it was me, Phila Dolo, Roger, and Scorpion.  We hitchhiked on a truck.  We knew that we were going to an operation, but we didn't know what type of operation was that.  Phila Dolo was the only one who knew what kind of operation we were going to as he was our Commander. We hitchhiked until the area where the operation was to be carried out.  That is where he explained to us what was about to happen. It was in the morning, very early and it was misty and you couldn't see perfectly who were in the car.  And Mr Dolo as my Commander said that me, Kleintjie, I should move away from them something like a distance of hundred meters so that I could look out for white cars, people, white people in cars.  And I took that order, and then a van approached which had three passengers in them.  It were white people, and I gave a signal as I was ordered to.  And from there I heard gunshots from where my Comrades were standing, and the car went out of the road.  The people in the car alighted and they ran away, and I tried to get to my Comrades at that time.  My Comrades were chasing those people by then, that is those white people who had come out of the car.  There was another car approaching from the direction of Herschel.  That car stopped and this white people got into that car.  When that car tried to make a U-turn, Comrade Dolo gave us orders not to shoot and said that he was the only one who was going to shoot.  When that car made a U-turn, Comrade Dolo started shooting and that car fell over the bridge.  We went to investigate what happened with the car.  When we got there we found a white female and she seemed dead, and there was another black person there, who were lying outside the car.  And the black person also seemed dead.  One of my Comrades, that Comrade Scorpion, saw the others who had survived and he chased them, and in his chase he fired some shots.  And Comrade Phila also followed and fired shots.  Comrade Phila also shot this person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Is this now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> That is the person who was being chased by Comrade Scorpion who had survived the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he only shoot one of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> May you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand it, two people ran away.  Did Scorpion only shoot one of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, he only shot one of them.  That is the one he was chasing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What happened to the other one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> The other one, what I realise was that when we were about to withdraw and in the car he was the person who was hitchhiking along the road who Comrade Dolo wanted to run down with the car.  I think that is the second person that survived the incident.  After Comrade Dolo shot this other person he called us all, and when we got to him while we still gathering there another car appeared from the direction of Herschel and it had female in the, in it.  The females I noticed were two who were sitting in the front.  What happened is that Comrade Dolo stopped the car.  Comrade Dolo had an R4 in his left hand and he stopped the car with his right hand.  The car came to a stop and Comrade Dolo asked them to take us to Sterkspruit.  The female who was driving said she couldn't drive because she was frightened at that time because of what had happened, because there was someone who was lying along the road.  There was a car with wrecked windows and she suspected that something that had just happened, and then Comrade Dolo borrowed the car and he told the driver that she would find the car at Sterkspruit at Moleko's place.  By that time there was a shop, a very big shop, which belonged to Moleko and that is where he told them they would find the car.  And then Comrade Dolo got in the car and I also got into the car and the other Comrades got at the back of that car.  Once we in the car, when Comrade Dolo lifted his head he saw a white 4 X 4 bakkie facing us.  And then he gave me the R4 and ordered me to shoot that car. And then came out of the car, I shot at that other car.  I can't remember how many bullets I used, and then that car reversed.  It was white person in the car and he was alone and when he reversed, Comrade Dolo made a U-turn and we then drove off.  Along the road we met another white person hitchhiking and Comrade Dolo tried to run that person with the car, and he realised that he would be wasting his time by doing that and we drove away.  According to our agreement with the owners of the car, we agreed that we would leave the car at Sterkspruit, but we ran out of fuel.  And when that happened we moved into another village, but before, that is before we arrived at Sterkspruit.  I can't remember what the village place was, and we left the car near to a school, together with the keys inside and then we went on foot, and we went to our base that we were staying.  When we arrived there we gave the guns to Comrade Peter, and thereafter Comrade Peter said that he was going to report, I didn't where he was going to report or who he was going to report to.  I would end there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> To give your Comrades a signal, were you also armed or not, and if so, with what were you armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I had a 38 special revolver on me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Do you still today, do you still perceive Settlers or whites, to be still enemies or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> If at all they carry themself as the whites who supported the past regime I still view them as my enemies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> So, Mr Mthembu, can I ask the witness to repeat what he has just said.  I did not pick it up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What I am trying to say is that the boss.  If they still carry themselves as oppressors, I will still perceive them as my enemies.  But if it at all they do what the Africans do, or behave like Africans, and are not oppressive, I will take them as Africans.  I won't take them as my enemies any longer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Makoala, is there anything that you would like to say to the victims and to the next of kin of the deceased people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> In the first instance I would like to ask for forgiveness from Mr Tsemane's family about what happened.  We didn't plan to kill that person, but because of the situation at that time he, he got involved in the attack.  I would like to ask for forgiveness from Mr Tsemane's family.  May they please forgive me because it was not our intention to kill black people. To the families of other victims I would like to say, in every war or struggle there are people that get injured, there are people that die, and there are people that get crumpled.  I'm trying to explain to the family of these victims that what happened, happened because we were in a struggle, or in a war for freedom.  I'll end up there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Is there anything more you wish to add, or to tell the Committee about, or is that your testimony?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, that is Mr Makoala's testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mbandazayo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> No questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Makoala when did you join APLA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I joined APLA in 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> When, can you tell us the month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> It was right at the beginning of year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Training in Umtata is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you learn how to use weapons, like the R4?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Who was your Commander in Umtata at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I wasn't in Umtata, I was in Jozanna.  At that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Commander in Jozanna?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> My Commander at that time was, Comrade Phila, not Comrade Dolo it was Comrade Phila. His other name is Pawa or Comrade Uys.  And those were the names I knew in, with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Is he still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I'm not sure about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> When did you last see him?  That is now Phila Uys Pawa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> If I remember when I last saw him in 1993. At Umtata.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now, before the 19th of November 1992, that was the attack that you just described in your evidence, on how many other operations had you embarked, had you gone on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Are you asking me to explain about those operations, or should I tell you the number of operation I was involved in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Idea of how many other operations, I don't, the purpose of the question is not to get details about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> There can be about three or four, if I remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And we heard yesterday from Mr Dolo, your co-applicant, that on two previous occasions you were with him when he did a, a training operation at the same spot of the road between Sterkspruit and Lady Grey.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Include those two training operations, in the form, in the previous operation that you were involved in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, I don't include them, because I wasn't aware that, that they were operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you, on those two occasions, those training operations, can you just tell us briefly, give us a description of what occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What happened in the first instance is that, we were, I was still in the same unit with Comrade Dolo, Roger and Scorpion.  Firstly we attacked a car, which had a white person in it and we attacked the car with molotovs.  But that car was not damaged.  We were only testing our molotovs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> With your molotovs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes we were intending to hit the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was not an attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> My Commander, Comrade Dolo told me that, that was not an attack it was only an, a training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You through molotovs which are, we all know are dangerous objects at a car with an intention to hit it.  It would appear to me it amounts to attempted murder on your part.  Why have you not asked amnesty for it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I only thought that was training, this molotovs were not quite up to standard, because they had, they were white, they didn't even explode.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Bad, weren't they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I don't know what, whether my Commander knew that those molotovs were dangerous or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's about the second attack now?  Now tell us about one attack where you threw molotovs at a car driven by a white person, what about the other attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> In the second attack I still in the very same unit with the Comrades I have mention it me, Comrade Dolo, Roger and Scorpion.  We were there trying to attack a car again, but nothing happened to that car again.  No molotovs were thrown, we were intending to hit that car with molotovs but it was travelling at very high speed and we couldn't do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... (inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No we didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you walked all that way, you saw a car going past you at very high speed and you walked home again.  Is that what you are telling us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Chairperson through you, it is that all that happened at that second occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> May you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Is that all that happened on the second occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.  Nothing further happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And on the first occasion did you only throw molotovs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You sure about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I'm sure about that, because I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> See, your Comrade told us yesterday that he fired some shots at one of those vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> My Comrade try to shoot, but his rifle jammed, so there was no shots fired, if I remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> He told us he fired, he didn't say anything about his rifle jamming.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> All I know that, that gun jammed and only molotovs were thrown to that car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And the other car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Nothing happened to the second car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you.  Mr Makoala did you prepare those molotovs, your unit that is, at Jozanna's?  I will repeat the question, did your unit, including yourself, did you make those molotovs before you went on those, as you call them, training operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Why, the 19th of November, the day that you actually carried out an attack and killed people there, did you have molotovs with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, there were no molotovs. I don't really know, because only my Commander knows the molotovs were not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Was there no room in your unit to discuss the operation with your Commander, that  is Mr Dolo, before you went out on a operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> As a soldier I was only briefed when we arrived at our destination where the operation was to be carried out.  I only took orders.  All I know, all I knew was that we are going to a operation, I didn't know what type of operation it was.  I was only briefed when we arrived at the place of the operation what was about to happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> On the previous occasions you went on foot, we heard yesterday.  Approximately 16 kilometres to the venue and 16 kilometres back.  But, on the third occasion, that is on the 19th of November, you went by truck, you got a lift there.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Was there any explanation given for that chance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, there was no explanation given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> When you alighted from that vehicle that had taken you to the road, were you ultimately carried out the attack, did you know that you were going to attack white motorists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I only knew that were going to an operation, but not knowing what type of operation it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Along the road were you told that you were now going to do the something that you done on the two previous occasions, that is attack white motorists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> When we arrived at the place of the operation, Comrade Dolo told us that were going to engage in a ambush, were going to attack cars belonging to whites.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Where there any discussion about whether any vehicles drive by any other racial groups for example, black people, were there any precautions to be taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, we were told about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> What were the precautions that you had to take?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Comrade Dolo said to us we should take that we do not attack cars belonging to Africans, because white others thing of making black people to drive for them and sit on the other side, as passengers.  So he said we should take it not to injure Africans, that is how he gave me an order to go and be on the lookout as to whether all passengers in the car are all white.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you just, did you have binoculars with you or some apparatus that you could see more clearly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, I didn't have any binoculars.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> That vehicle that you attacked there was being driven by Mr Schroeder, who was a Coloured man, not a white man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know what Mr Schroeder looked like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I only saw white people in the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct) Coloured in this country to cover a wide range of features.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I won't pursue that at this time, I'm, unfortunately the family didn't arrive yesterday and I needed to speak to them about that.  If I may hold that aspect over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>Well, let me move on.  The vehicle that came from the Herschel side that stopped as you say and picked up these white people, we know that was Mr Tsemane, a black man.  Yet he was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I didn't know that it was Mr Tsemane in that car.  But what I saw was that he was dead by the time the car fell over the bridge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> We understand your evidence that you were very far from that point where Mr Tsemane picked up the white people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> By that time I was trying to get to my Comrades, moving away from the position where I gave the signal and I was running by then, and it was misty.  I couldn't see clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So you were unable to see who the driver was at that stage of that vehicle who had picked up the white people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> From firing at the vehicle driven by the white man who reversed, that is when Mr Dolo gave you the R4, did you fire any other shots on that occasion?  From any other weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No.  I only fired shots from the R4.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Where you next to Scorpion, or with Scorpion when he shot the person on the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, I was far from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Where you able to see how Scorpion managed to shoot this person?  Let me make it easier, was this person running away at the time that Scorpion shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, the person was running away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> When Scorpion fired he fell down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, he fell down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And then Dolo, Mr Dolo went up to him, this person with his R4 rifle, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I move on.  Are you able to tell us how many times Scorpion fired at this person, or are you unable to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I can't tell how many times he fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> More than once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What I'm saying is that I can't explain how many times he fired, because what happened is that I heard the sound from the R4 after Comrade Scorpion fired.  There was a gunshot, as you know that an R4 is a big sound.  I only heard that sound.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Dolo was, in relation to that person who had been shot by Scorpion, could you see where he was, and the body at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> May you repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Could you see where Mr Dolo was when you heard the R4 fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I could see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The rifle was pointed at the man's head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, I couldn't see where the gun was placed.  All I heard was the gun 4 sound, the R4 sound.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Where you able to see that person before he was shot by Mr Dolo, or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> May you repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you, were you able to see this man who was shot by Dolo before he was shot by Dolo?  Was he, I want to establish whether you saw him, whether he was moving, or whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> From where I was standing, I couldn't see what was happening.  I couldn't see whether the person was moving or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> What was Roger doing at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Me and Roger were standing on the bridge by that time, looking down where the white female was lying, who seemed dead, together with Tsemane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> When the vehicle with the females arrived on the scene, is it not correct, according to one of their affidavits, Mrs Booysen, the firearms, or firearms were pointed at them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, no-one pointed guns at them.  I think they were frightened by the gun Dolo was having, because it was a big rifle.  The guns we had on us were put away so as not to frighten those people.  But Comrade Dolo didn't have a place where he could hide is gun because it was a big one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Where did you hide your guns away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> We put them in our pockets, because we had dustcoats on us and these coats have big pockets, that's how we could hide our guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You've said through the "we" word, you were the person known as Kleintjie, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Roger was there and Scorpion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, they were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you call the first applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I used to call him Kenny.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that, there was only the four of you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you got your amnesty application before you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I've got it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On page 11 you have set out details of the incidents you were involved in, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which of these, those events, is the one you are talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> It is the incident of Lady Grey.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Lady Grey ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes. Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And who did you say were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> It was me, Comrade Dolo - Phila Dolo - Kenny, Roger and Scorpion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) who is Jabo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I can't remember who Jabo is.  I can't remember him, but what I know is that it was me, Comrade Phila Dolo, Roger and Scorpion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you can't remember Jabo, but you put him in your application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> There were reason for me not to remember him why is that by the time I made my application, no-one helped me, no-one led me and there are so many names involved here.  Maybe I think an error was committed here regarding names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you say that two persons was killed in this attack and three injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But that's not what you've told us today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I can't remember some of the facts clearly.  I only remember them when my Comrades reminds me of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can't you remember that two people were killed in the vehicle that went off the bridge, that you stood and looked at, at that somebody else was shot in the head on the road?  You say you can't remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I remember about those two people who I looked at from the bridge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At the man who was shot by Scorpion and Dolo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes I also remember him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the body that was left lying there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes I remember him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then why isn't he in your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Whose name are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The three people who were killed.  You have said you remember the three, but in you application you say only two people were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> It is because this person who was shot by Comrade Dolo and Phila Scorpion, and Scorpion, I was not sure whether he was dead or alive.  The only ones I saw that were dead are the ones I was looking at, which is Mr Tsemane and this white female.  That is why in my application I only mention two people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Do you know any person by the name Jabo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Comrades used many chimerengas.  There were some Comrades who called themselves by the name Jabo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) injured in this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> All I know is that Mr Tsemane is the one who died because I heard people talking about him in the location and I realised that it was Mr Tsemane who died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In your application which I have already referred to you, you say two persons was killed in this act, three injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> May you repeat what you have said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In you application which is before you, which I have referred you to, you say two persons was killed in this act, three injured.  I want to know who those three injured were that you write about in your application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Those who were injured are the one who I shot at with an R4 rifle and the one who Comrade Dolo tried to run down with his car and the one who was shot by Comrade Scorpion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) to run down injured</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> He looked as if he was limping.  I don't know whether he got injured when the car was shot at.  I don't know whether he was injured at the first time when the car was shot at, but he seemed limping by the time I looked at him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And are you seriously suggesting that the man who Dolo shot in the head at close range, whose body was lying on the road, you thought he was just injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Because I am not a doctor.  I thought, I can't tell whether he was only injured, or dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The body was fairly close to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, the body was not close to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well you told us it was close enough for the women to be frightened of it.  Have you forgotten that you have told us that in your evidence this morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What I said is the body was lying along the road and I thought these ladies were frightened by this body who is blood all over it.  I didn't say that body was next to me or near to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have now said you could see there was blood all over it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, blood was visible because if a cloth is bright, and blood is all over it, then you can see that, because this person was wearing a bright clothes or bright clothing, and blood could be seen all over that clothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Makoala, just something we got to pick up here, but just before I do.  The man's head was just about blown apart.  If you could see there was blood all over the place, you would have seen that his head was just about blown apart.  It would have been pretty obvious to anybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, I couldn't see where the bullet went through because of the distance between me and the body, but blood can be seen because it flows all over clothes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now when we dealt with the question of why Jabo's name appears under this particular operation you said you think you'd made a mistake.  You didn't know any Jabos.  Was that your answer, have I got it right?  Just let him answer Mr Mthembu.  He can tell me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, the answer Mr Lax was so many of the Comrades used the name Jabo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No, you got it wrong.  That's why I said let him answer.  That was much later he said that about chimerengan names.  When he first answered the Judge about Jabo, not Mr Sandi, he said he didn't recognise the name, he might have made a mistake.  He didn't know anyone called Jabo at that time.  That's what he said, that was his answer at that stage.  Later on when Mr Sandi asked him about it he ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> With respect my friend, my recollection of his answer to me, the first answer was "I can't remember who Jabo is".</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Precisely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Not that he didn't know any Jabo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well, he can't remember who Jabo is.  Fair enough.  That was the answer.  Am I correct that you can't remember who Jabo is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well then why do you put the name Jabo in a number of incidents on this annexure of yours if you don't know who this person is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> In this incident the people I were with .  I can't remember among them who was using the name Jabo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The question is, in your annexure here on page 11 you use the name Jabo three times in relation to three different incidents, and you tell us you can't remember who Jabo was.  Why does his name appear in three different incidents if you can't remember who he is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I can't remember which other Comrade used the name Jabo.  As I've explained earlier that most Comrades used the name Jabo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Then how could you put that name here if you don't know who it is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I have explained earlier that by the time I made my application there was no-one guiding me through and in my mind there were so many incidents, because there are so many things that happened and the names of the Comrades involved were so many, and that is where I believe an error was committed with the messing up of names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> There are probably no more than seven or eight separate names here that are used consistently throughout all these attacks.  Have a look.  Count them for yourself.  You mention Roger, you mention Kenny, you mention Scorpio.  Then you mentioned Kenny, Scorpio and then you mention Oupa.  Then you mention Temba Ngesi, Kenny and Jabo.  Then you mention Jabo, Scorpion, Kenny and Roger.  Scorpion, Max and Kenny.  Scorpion, Kenny, Jabo.  Do you see that?  And then right at the very bottom you mention General and Lawrence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes I can see those names.  What I remember is that there was another Comrade who I was involved with in an operation who is called Jabo.  But in this attack I am talking about, that is the Lady Grey ambush, their was no Comrade named Jabo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You will notice that up until Umtata you were with the same group of people most of the time.  So we can count Lawrence and General out of this annexure for the purposes of this discussion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, I think if you look, that was an 1994 attack.  All the other were the 1992 attacks, so this was a completely different event.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, that's what I am getting at.  So during the period 1992 you were involved with, broadly, one group of people with a few small exceptions.  Do you concede that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What I can say is that there were other Comrades with whom I worked with.  Like the Comrade who appeared at the bottom, that is General Lawrence and Max and Oupa.  It wasn't only the Comrades I was with at Lady Grey Ambush.  There were other Comrades with whom I worked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) were other Comrades in other matters that you haven't set out in your amnesty application because Mr Lax has read to you the names of all the people who appear in the annexure to your amnesty application.  Are you now saying you worked with other Comrades in other operations which you haven't disclosed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I'm only talking about the operation that appear in this annexure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You had a group who on one occasion were joined by Oupa, one occasion by Temba Ngese and one occasion by Max.  Otherwise it was the same group and Jabo was a member of it three times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The Judge had expressed the point exactly that I am trying to make to.  Please explain this to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Jabo joined our group only twice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Do I understand from your answer that you now remembered who Jabo was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> May I please explain in which attacks did Jabo take part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Answer the first question, do you now remember who Jabo was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> The Jabo I was with in this attacks is the one I am talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, so your answer is yes, you do remember him now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I only remember the Jabo I worked with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What other names did this Jabo use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I only know him as Jabo, and the other name is Dr Zamzam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When was the last time you saw Jabo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I last saw Jabo in 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Where was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> It was in Umtata.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What was happening in Umtata when you saw him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> We were in a political class when I last saw him, and I last saw him after the political class finished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I have difficulty.  You've now told us, you remember you were in political class with him 1994, he was also know as Dr Zamzam, he joined your group twice for attack.  Why did you tell me when I first asked you that you didn't remember who Jabo is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I was talking about the Jabo who was in the unit, but what I was explaining also was that other Comrades were using this name Jabo as a nickname or chimerengan name, but the Jabo I was with at the unit is the very same Dr Zamzam I am talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, just one thing, Mr Prior.  You mentioned to us earlier that you were involved in other operations outside of those training operations.  What operations were those?  Before this operation that we are dealing with today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> It is that at Mayaputi bridge and the attack on Zastron farmers and the Sterkspruit Hotel attack.  Mayaputi bridge in Zastron.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So it was Mayaputi Bridge in Zastron, then you said it's farm attacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Zastron farm attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Any others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes.  Sterkspruit Hotel attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Before this we are dealing with today?  The question was what attacks were you involved in before this one that we are dealing with today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What I remember is that the Mayaputi bridge attack happened before the one we are talking about.  It together with the Zastron farmer attack happened before the attack we are talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I can't remember whether the other attacks came after or before the one we are talking about, but all I remembered is that they happened in one year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you do remember those two before, the Mayaputi bridge and the Zastron farm attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And Kenny participated in both of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, he participated in both of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was he the leader in both of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> May I proceed, Mr Chairman?  If the Committee will bear with me and maybe correct me, my understanding yesterday was after this particular attack on the roadway at, near Herschel, you group then because you required funds or money or food, you went to the Sterkspruit Hotel.  In other words that was the next operation.  Am I correct in understanding that, Mr Chairman?  It was actually put to Mr Dolo that he had robbed at R55 000 on that occasion.  My understanding is that that happened after this particular attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Chairman, I don't remember such a question being put to Mr Dolo yesterday.  There was no such question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I agree, Mr Mbandazayo, but ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Prior, you might rephrase it into a slightly different way in terms of the fact that the papers in the bundles indicate that to be the case.  And that's where we have that impression form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> That's why I asked whether I was correct in understanding that there was evidence like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> I think the witness has already replied to your question, and I did not get any interpretation coming through.  Maybe you can put the question to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Maybe the Interpreter can just repeat the answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> He just says "yes"  He said yes, they went there because they didn't have money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You said after the attack on the road, the Sterkspruit Lady Grey Road near Herschel, I'm just trying to understand the sequence, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I can't remember whether it happened before or after, because these things happened quite a long time ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Certainly the sequence given in a confession that was put up at page 39 of the bundle, and I'm not, I don't intend to go into, I'm just trying to get the sequence.  At page 39 you indicated the attack on the vehicles and you give quite a lot of detail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Is that 39 of bundle "B", Mr Prior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Of bundle "B", yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> That's the typed transcript.  Then after that you say "we left the vehicle in town.  We went home.  We then heard on the news that a white person had died in hospital and the black person had died."  Then you said Phila said "we are hungry and we needed money.  Then he sent us to Sterkspruit Hotel, Moleko Hotel.  Dit was ek Kenny, Jabo en Temba - it was me, Jabo, Kenny and Temba."  What I'm simply putting to you, it would seem that if the Sterkspruit Hotel occurred very soon after this attack, it seems that Jabo was part of your unit on that occasion and you mention his name in your amnesty application, as you did in the Lady Grey ambush.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, he was a member of our unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I remember that he went with you to ambush that Lady Grey Sterkspruit Road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, he wasn't with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You stayed at Jozanna's Hoek for some months before this attack, is that correct?  This Herschel Lady Grey attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Who was the owner of that house?  Do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I don't know his name because when he got there he only used to meet with our Commander, not us.  He never even spoke to us.  That is why we don't even, I don't even know his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Do you know someone by the name of Dikotsi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Who is Dikotsi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Dikotsi was the Free State Regional Chairman of the PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did he send you to Jozanna's Hoek?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Who is Bele-Bele? Mbele-Mbele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Mbele-Mbele is an African whom I met at Sterkspruit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Is he also a member of PAC/APLA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> He is a member of the PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Do you know him by any other name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he take you to his house at Jozanna's Neck where you stayed for three days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> He didn't take us to Jozanna's Hoek.  He took us to Jozanna's Neck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> ...(inaudible) not Jozanna's Hoek.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so, he took us to Jozanna's Neck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Who was Ben?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Ben was one of our Comrades who used to drive for us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Was he part of your unit at the time of this ambush at Herschel, near Herschel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did he join afterwards, or before, or what?  Did he leave your unit before this attack in November 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What happened is that I just couldn't see him anymore.  I didn't know where he went.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Was he also staying at Jozanna's Hoek?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> He used to stay with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And Max, was he part of the unit at the time of this ambush, the one that we're dealing with now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, he wasn't part of our unit.  After I am attacking Lady Grey I didn't see him again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And you already told us Jabo was part of your unit at this time.  He was also known as Dr Zamzam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> There were many of us then together, but when we went out to attack, he only became a member of our unit in two attacks.  It was an attack on a garage and the attack at Sterkspruit Hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> What was this now? ...(inaudible) application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it appears in my application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Sorry, I beg your pardon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What are the two attacks you say?  Sterkspruit Hotel and what was the other one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Sterkspruit Garage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Sterkspruit Garage listed at page 12 of bundle "B".  Sorry, the persons involved were yourself, it looks like Annus, and Kenny. Oh, and Kenny.  You only list two people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At the Sterkspruit Hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Garage.  He says, yes, he was, he lists them as Sterkspruit Hotel, but over the page at page 12 of bundle "B", he lists the Sterkspruit Garage attack where he only says himself and Kenny were involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Annus, isn't, or is it and?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes I thought it was Annus, but Mr Lax corrected me, it is "and", because there is no comma.  Do you see that in your application?  Please look at page 12 of bundle "B".   It's something that you recorded there.  Is that right, do you only list yourself and Kenny as being part of the Sterkspruit Garage operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> It was me and Jabo, not Kenny.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I'm going to go onto something else, Mr Chairman, unless the Committee want to ask any questions around this.  Just, I just want to point out to you that now this is a fourth incident during 1992 that Jabo was involved, and yet you couldn't remember the person when we first started asking you about him.  I just want some clarity about some names that appear in your statement to the Magistrate, that is the confession which appeared page 37 of bundle "B".  Those names are Sipho, was he part of the unit at the time of the Herschel Lady Grey ambush?  The names are Sipho, Kenny, well we know Kenny is, sorry let's deal with that seriatim.  Sipho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, he wasn't part of the unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Kenny, it's spelled there KHENE, it may be a different spelling.  Who is that person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> It is Phila Dolo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Medibula?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> That is another Comrade with whom I was in training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did he have any other names, Medibula?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> He used the name Kenny.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And we've got Roger, we know about, and the other name is Lepha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> He was one of the Comrades I was in training with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Was he part of your unit at the time of this attack that we're dealing with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No he wasn't part of our unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What, when we use the word unit, and Mr Prior, maybe you can help us here, there are different ways of understanding what that means, and maybe that's why you keep saying "no".</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The unit I am referring to is the unit that went out on these operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But haven't we been told, Mr Prior, that a unit was picked for an operation only.  It was two or three men who went and did it.  And then is disbanded.  They used unit in the sense of that particular operation.  But also before you go on, the name Kenny does not appear there as a separate name.  There is no comma after Kenny, it is Kenny Medibula comma.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, I notice that now.  I am grateful to ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because he goes on a little later where he refers to "Phila moes ons oplaai".</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I'd like to just move back to the day of the incident.  I just need some clarity on the following aspect.  You said when the, after the initial shooting, that is after your signal that you gave, there was a vehicle that came from Herschel.  We know now that the vehicle that was driven by Mr Tsemane.   You said the people, the white people that got out of the first bakkie all got into that vehicle.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> How many white people did you see getting into that vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I am not sure how many got into the car as I have already explained that I was running at that time, trying to get route to where my Comrades where.  I just didn't realise how many whites got into that car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Well did you that the female, the white female, got into the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes I realised that the white female got into that car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> This way, when the, Mr Tsemane drove away with that vehicle, there were no other people running away on the road at that stage?  I just want to get some clarity on that, from your perspective.  In other words all the occupants of the vehicle that had been attacked had climbed in, or got in onto Mr Tsemane's vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I am not sure whether they all got in that car, but after that car made a U-turn there was no-one running, that is running or getting out of the car that was attacked initially.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Excuse me, Mr Prior.  Can I just ask one question for clarity.  You said you, after you gave the sign then you started running towards the, where the other Comrades were.  Now when this car driven by Tsemane stopped, how far were you from that car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I was something like 100m away from that car. ADV SANDI:   Mr Dolo yesterday said where you were standing giving the sign, it was almost 100m.  In other words, you had just started running from the place where you were standing to give the sign, the signal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What I can say is that they were also running forward, that is why I can't say the metres were becoming less between me and them.  They were still running, trying to chase those people.  That's why I say I don't think that the metres had lessened by then. I'm not saying I was exactly 100m away from them, it's just an estimation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Away from you or towards your direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> They were running away from me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How many people did you see getting into the car which had stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> As I have said I couldn't see exactly how many people got into the car.  What I realised is that a female got into that car.  I couldn't see whether the others were in the car, but by that time there was no-one along the road.  There was not white person along the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you, Mr Prior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, the purpose of my question is the following, that if those people including the man who was later shot by Scorpion had been in that vehicle, that, we know that vehicle had left the road, Tsemane's vehicle.  And my confusion is this, how did Mr Schroeder who we know was later shot, how did he get onto the road is he had boarded Mr Tsemane's vehicle?  That was my, Mr Chairman, that was my understanding of Mr Dolo's evidence that the occupants hiked a taxi.  I think they, at page 3 of the bundle "B" in his affidavit he said "The occupants came out of the car and ran away.  They hiked a taxi and I shot the taxi and it fell off the bridge."   So my question is, if those people got into Mr Tsemane's vehicle that left the road, how did that person come back onto the road if he was in fact in Tsemane's vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What I am explaining is that I couldn't see how many people got into the car.  I don't know when did that person escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> If the Committee will just bear with me.  There is one aspect I just wish to verify from Mr Brummer's statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> While you are doing that, Mr Prior, perhaps I can just canvass something else with the witness.  You said to us in your evidence that when you, once Dolo had stopped this vehicle with the ladies in it and the driver said she couldn't drive because she was so frightened.  You then borrowed the vehicle, then you told her that she would find it at Molefe's store, or Moleko's store.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, it isn't true.  We said she would find the car next to Moleko's place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Moleko's place, is that a hotel, is that a store?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> It is a store.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The point I'm trying to make is, who told her that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Comrade Phila told her that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> See, that's not what he told us yesterday.  He didn't specify where she would find the vehicle at all.  Please explain this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> If I remember well Comrade Dolo said it is me who remembers some of the things, because he said yesterday he couldn't remember well what he said and everything that happened.  But I can remember well what he said, because I was standing next to him by then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now the second thing I wanted to canvass with you while Mr Prior is just looking for where, for this portion of his evidence, of the letter from Mr Brummer.  You've told us that the reason you had to go and be a lookout was because of the misty conditions on that day, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well you see Mr Dolo told us nothing about it being misty on that day.  He said the reason why you had to go there was because there was a curve on the road and you couldn't see clearly from where you, where they were positioned.  Please explain this to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> The curve is also one of the reasons and it was also misty because it was in the morning and we couldn't see clearly who the occupants of the cars were.  Whether it were whites or black people.  The curve was also a reason why we couldn't see clearly who the occupants of the cars passing by were.  That is when Comrade Dolo ordered me to go to a certain place so that I could give them a signal whether the car passing by belonged to white people or to black people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Why did you leave your area where you were supposed to be the lookout?  The operation wasn't over, you hadn't had a signal to retreat, why did you leave that place where you had been ordered to go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> The order was I must give a signal and thereafter I must join the Comrades, so I couldn't stand there while the Comrades were working, I had to work together with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But your operation was to attack vehicles in the plural, not just one vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> While you are still there talking about signal, your instruction was that you should raise you hat when you see a vehicle driven by white people.  The vehicle driven by</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a>Mr Schroeder was not a vehicle driven by white people, or with white people as occupants.  Can you tell us the reason why you gave a signal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I gave a signal because I thought it were, I saw them as whites in the car.  I didn't know they were Coloureds in that car.  According to my knowledge there are Coloureds who look like white people and there are Coloured who look like me, skin-wise.  But in that car there were only Coloureds who looked like white people that is why I gave the signal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When they were being chased, when they were running away, wouldn't you people see that they were not white, they were Coloured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> As I have said earlier that there are Coloureds who look like whites.  I couldn't differentiate whether they were Coloureds or white.  We couldn't tell the difference, we only perceived them as whites.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> What I want to put to you, I was able to find a Mr Brummer mark, but the information that I have gleaned is that Mrs Brummer and Mr Schroeder were on their way to the Score Furnisher where they worked in, supermarket, in Sterkspruit.  There were only two occupants of that vehicle.  I may also put it to you, in the Police investigation that I am privy to there was no other mention of any other occupant in that bakkie driven by Mr Schroeder and the passenger, Mrs Brummer, on that morning.  Are you saying there were more that two occupants of that bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Just one last thing,  I notice from your annexure to your amnesty application, apart from the Umtata matter in '94 it seems that your operations all were concluded in 1992.  I just want to know is there a reason, were you withdrawn from the field or what is the position, because there seems to be no attacks</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>in '93.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> May you please repeat you question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> In the list, the extensive list, of attacks in which you participated, apart from the one in Umtata in '94, all the other attacks were in 1993.  I just want to know, it, were you withdrawn from operations for 1993, for example.  It doesn't seem that you participated in any attacks in 1993.  And I want to know if it is so, what is the reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I was withdrawn from the unit in 1992.  I didn't partake in any attack in 1993.  I was in ...(indistinct) by that time, so I didn't take part in attacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> It seems that after the Herschel attack where these people were killed on the road you say you then were withdrawn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I was withdrawn from attacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Was there any sanction by APLA or the PAC because of this attack?  That this didn't fit in with their policy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No there was nothing like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say Herschel attack, which do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> This matter we're dealing with Mr Chairman is commonly referred to as the Herschel ambush.  It's the Lady Grey ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well he's described it as the Lady Grey ambush in his application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, Herschel is very close to Sterkspruit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but I just want to make sure.  He called it the Lady Grey.  Do you realise that when you were asked about the Herschel application it meant this one which you called the Lady Grey ambush?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> By the time I made the application, I didn't know the name of places.  I only realised afterwards that this place was between Herschel and Lady Grey, after I made my application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What about the other matters you talked about in your application.  Two attacks on Lady Grey farms, were they before or after this attack we've been talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> They happened before this attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the Sterkspruit Hotel and Garage attack, were they before or after?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> They took place before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So this was the last attack you were involved in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.  That was in 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> And you became an instructor after this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, that was in 1993 when I became an instructor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What were you supposed to do as</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> My job was to canvass for membership from people who came from Jo'burg, Free State and to train them so that they could protect the members of the Organisation as our members were being attacked there were no people to protect them.  So my job entailed giving them training to protect our members, that is the members of the PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where were ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> That happened in Umtata.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Just to be fair to you, because I think there's ...(inaudible) and you've agreed with it, the Moleko Hotel, the Sterkspruit Hotel attack happened after this ambush we're talking about today.  I thought we'd established that earlier from you.  Now I don't want you to end up being confused and agreeing to something you didn't necessarily agree with.  I just want you to be clear about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prior, will there be any evidence from the Police as to when these attacks did take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, I have that available.  I don't have it with me now, but it will be available.  Mr Chairman, the thought has just occurred to me that Sterkspruit is a common, is an attack in which both applicants feature, or certainly indicate on this application, but I see it's not, it hasn't been prepared as part of the hearings.  I feel that in, I understand that there was no gross violation in the sense that people weren't killed or injured in that matter, but I believe that that matter could be presented, I think conveniently during this sitting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I think it's a matter you can certainly discuss with their attorneys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, otherwise it makes no sense if we simply deal with the matter at hand and leave Sterkspruit for some other time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well we will be adjourning fairly soon.  You can talk to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What I want to know is, Mr Lax is relying, as he is quite entitled to do, on the information contained in the applicant's affidavit.  But have we more reliable information as to when the hotel attack and the garage attack took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman I can get that within minutes.  If we could take, maybe take the adjournment at this stage.  I'll have that information very quickly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, we'll do that.  We'll take the adjournment so you can discuss this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a>HEARING ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, for the record, I was able to establish via the Police that the Sterkspruit Hotel matter or incident occurred on the 27th of October 1992 and the sum involved there was R65 000,00.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 27th ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> 27th of October 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the sum was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> R65 000,00.  Mr Chairman I also endeavoured to find out whether there was any information, I understand that despite diligent searching to the documents the Police docket, if there ever was one, is just not to hand.  That matter occurred within the Transkei as it was then known.  We've been unable to locate any documentation regarding any investigation relating to that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the garage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> We haven't been able to get any information on that as yet, Mr Chairman, thank you.  Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.  I understand from the Tsemane family, Miss Alda Tsemane has a few questions to put to this applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I am Ida T Tsemane.  I am a daughter to the late Mr James Tsemane.  I want to ask you Thabiso, as you arrived in Sterkspruit in 1992 is there a house were you giving accommodation before you went to Jozanna where you were hiding?  Can you please tell this house who accommodated you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I arrived at Mr Mbele-Mbele's house where he took us to his house in Jozanna's Neck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Is that the only house belonging to Mr Mbele-Mbele which you used to frequent in Sterkspruit?   Because that Mr Mbele-Mbele is a PAC member.  Is that the only house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, also Jozanna's Hoek, at the house of a person which I said I don't know his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Would you, would I be wrong if I say I saw you many a times going to Sterkspruit in town?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, I used to frequent to town.  I won't agree with you when you said, you say you seen me a lot of times in town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> When I say I see you, I saw you in a house in Sterkspruit.  Would you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Could you please explain what you are saying when you say you saw me in Sterkspruit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Would I be wrong by saying that I saw you a lot of times in Sterkspruit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> There are black people staying in town at Sterkspruit and I used to visit them.  Visit their work places, so I don't know in which house did you see me.  You know exactly there is only one house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> When you went to conduct your attack, it seems as if you hiked, you hitchhiked on a truck.  Where was that truck from and where was it driving to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> The truck was from Sterkspruit heading for Herschel and we met the truck, I can't remember the names of places, but the met the truck just outside town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Did you go to town on foot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> When my father helped Mrs Brummer and Peter, did he see you, or was he just helping the victims who were struggling around the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I'm not sure whether he could see us or not, but according to the situation there we were in the road where everyone could see us.  But I don't know whether he could personally see us.  If he was here he could explain whether he could see us or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Where you where everyone could see you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes.  We were right in the middle of the road</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Is it true that you killed my father because he tried to help the victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> He wasn't in our plan of attack.  We didn't plan to kill him.  It's just that he got hit by a stray bullet.  We were not planning to kill black people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Clarify, if I may, are you saying that you didn't aim at her father when these shots were going off, and there, because you must have seen him, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> As I said earlier I couldn't see that the person who was helping these white people was black or white.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> ...(inaudible) or not.  You intended to shoot that car and whoever was in that car.  Don't try and duck the issue by saying it was a stray bullet.  Please carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> We didn't intentionally kill him because we were aiming to kill white people, not black people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) help the people escape, by killing the driver of the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Chairman, through you, I think the interpretation from Sesotho to English, I don't believe that the right word is used.  When he says "morero" I think he was saying it was not in their planning to have murdered Mr Tsemane, not that they were aiming at him, but it was not in the planning, that's my understanding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But your planning was what you did when you picked up your guns and shot.  I agree it would not be in your planning before because you didn't know he would be there.  But when he stopped to pick up these white people, didn't you then shoot to stop him doing it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What happened is that Comrade Phila shot at the car.  I don't know whether he was aiming for the driver, or where.  All I saw was the car going down the bridge.  If it were me who had fired the shot, I would be able to explain to the Committee whether I was aiming at the driver or aiming at the tyres.  Unfortunately it is not me who fired the shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> You said you stayed at Jozanna.  What name did you call the name, the owner of that place by?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Every time the owner of the house was there he didn't meet us.  He only met with our Commander.  That is why I didn't know his name.  He didn't come very often to that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Where did he stay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I don't know where he stayed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Do you know Pitso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, I don't know Pitso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Are you telling this house that you telling the truth when you say you don't know Pitso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I am telling the truth.  I don't know Pitso.  Maybe if you can tell him how he looks, maybe I might say I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Would I be wrong if I said you were staying at Mr Pitso's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, I just hear that from you.  All I know is that the house we were living in, staying in, I don't know who it belonged to and who the owner's name was.  But if you want me to explain to you where the house was, I can.  If maybe I was living in Sterkspruit, or a resident of Sterkspruit, I would know maybe who the owner of the house was, but you can tell the difference between Jozanna's Hoek and Jozanna's Neck because of the time I had stayed there I could differentiate between the two places.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> You say you were killing white people.  There are no whit people in Sterkspruit.  Which white people were you going to kill then in Sterkspruit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> There are white people in Sterkspruit.  There are white people working from shops, who own shops and those working in furniture shops.  No I want you to tell me why do you say there are no white people in Sterkspruit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> There are now white people in Sterkspruit.  The only white people who are there are there to serve the Sterkspruit community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> But what remains is that there are white people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Why did you choose among these white people?  Do you realise that you are being used by that time?  By the people you have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No it is not like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> They were using you as if they were killing white people whilst they were aiming to reach for their business objectives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I don't agree with you when you say that.  All I know is that we were killing white people because they were our enemies at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Were you not choosing whether those white people where serving the community or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> The people you are talking about were members of the PAC who helped us with accommodation, food and so on.  We were not working for one single person as you have said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> In your attack, why didn't you attack the white person who was working with you in business at Sterkspruit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I don't understand your question.  May you please repeat it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Why didn't you in your attack, attack this white person whom the PAC people used together with business, in business?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> There was no white people, or white person with whom we were involved in business.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Why didn't you ever attack Mr Hattingh?  I'm talking about Mr Hattingh who drives in the 4 X 4.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Which one is that?  I don't know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> May you please repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I told you that he belonged to "Engelfoot". It is the first time that I hear that.  If at all he was present during the day of the attack I think him as a white person could have been attacked also.  If you listen to the testimony where that boy in the 4 X 4 was shot at and then he reversed.  Our Commander said that we have to leave.  Then our Commander did a U-turn and we all left.  That boy in the 4 X 4 vehicle was also attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> You made a U-turn and went away because you hurt your victims and to which you were directed from the PAC that a Score van will approach from some direction.  I have the impression that you only out to attack that van.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I only hear that from you.  All I know is that we are going to attack white people not only that van from Score.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> You killed my father and you first started attacking the whites who were working with him.  It is Mr van Rooyen and Masheba and you didn't succeed in your operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Unfortunately I didn't know that those white people were working with Mr Tsemane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Mr van Rooyen works in a bakery.  He was my father's boss.  Mr Masheba also worked in a bakery.  You ended up by killing my father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The relevance of these questions, I may be able to assist the Committee.  I canvassed the questions with Miss Tsemane.  Mr van Rooyen and the other gentleman who worked at the bakery are the people that I believe were involved in the molotov, the abortive molotov attack a few days before this incident and I understand that is why this lady, the relevance of these questions are being put.  I don't think it is coming across as clear as that, but Mr van Rooyen was the owner of the bakery and his vehicle was attacked a few days before the 19th of November and I think that is the perspective of the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On the information you supplied us with earlier, Mr Prior, it was on the 3rd of November.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, but I'm saying it was the training operations that were alluded to in the evidence.  The information that Mr van Rooyen's vehicle was attacked, he was the baker at Sterkspruit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Perhaps you could assist us here Mr Prior.  She's referred to a vehicle as a "Score" vehicle, is this the vehicle Brummer and Schroeder were in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I understand there was no logo on the bakkie as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Is she suggesting that they would have know which vehicle they were attacking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I think what she's putting to this, to the witness is that they were attacking the people there who worked in Sterkspruit.  Mr van Rooyen was attacked earlier with this molotov.   He was the baker at Sterkspruit and some days or weeks later the Score vehicle was attacked with Mrs Brummer and Mr Schroeder, it think that's the thrust of the questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> While we're on this, do you know anything about an attack on a Mr Geursel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> That's the Sterkspruit Mayaputi, we're going to hear that later, next week, Mr Chairman, with applicant Gumpha.  But that I believe occurred before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The day before, apparently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> You have killed my father while we was trying the help Mrs Brummer and you killed them both and their blood mixed made a sacrifice for the freedom we are now in.  Thereafter if I had to hear well you are only asking forgiveness from me only.  Why is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What I've said is that I would ask Mr Tsemane's family to forgive me, because what happened didn't happen intentionally.  Our aim was to kill white people, not black people.  I think that's what I said earlier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> The places you were always at Mbele-Mbele and Pitso's were I saw you most of the times, do you know that all those people had football clubs which were rivals?  That is why I say to you, they were using you for their aims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, I don't know about that.  And whether those people were owners of football clubs, I don't know.  It's the first time I hear about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> You knew very well about that.  You just don't want to tell this house the truth.   I'll end up there with my questions to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You sit down please.  During the course of your questioning you referred to, as I understood it, Peter as one of the people who had been attacked in this vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> I beg your pardon, Sir, I didn't hear property.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You referred to, as I recollect your evidence to Peter, as one of the people who was attacked, that's Peter Schroeder.  From the way you said it, it appeared that you knew him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> I know Peter very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, I don't know if you've been listening to the evidence.  Mr Prior put certain questions saying that Peter was a Coloured man, why did they attack a Coloured man, and we stopped him on the basis that there was no evidence as to what Peter looked like, whether he would have known that Peter was a Coloured man and not a white man.  Do you understand what I am saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Now you know whether this is true or not.  If you accept that, you couldn't have said, couldn't have seen that Peter was not a white man, then you'd believe it.  But if you think anybody looking would have immediately seen that Peter was not a white man I think you ought to question this witness about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> I'm sorry, sir, I just forgot, I did wanted to ask because them, because I know Peter very well, and Peter was really a Coloured, he was not, when you looked at Peter, you wouldn't say you are looking at a white person.  They knew that Peter was working at Score and he was a Coloured.  They had information that they gathered from Sterkspruit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> My reply is that as I've explained earlier that in that car that we attacked we only saw white people.  What my dear mother explains there that Peter looked like a Coloured.  It is true.  I believe when she says it was a Coloured and as to how the Committee explained to me.  But I earlier said there are those Coloured who look white people.  To the extent that you can't tell the difference whether this person is white Coloured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You see, she's suggesting to you that he didn't look like a white person.  That's what she's just asked you, and, or put to you.  And it's that what you have been asked to comment on.  You've gone right around the question in a big circle, but you haven't answered it.  She's disagreeing with you.  Do you say she's wrong?  Yes or no.  It's very simple, we don't need a long answer, yes or no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I've managed, Mr Chairman, I've managed to secure a photograph at very short notice of Mr Peter Schroeder.  I understand he's on the left in the grey suite.  I have another photograph, he's on the right hand side of the photograph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Can I say something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> After killing Peter and my father, you left because you knew that you had completed a job.  There would be no white person again coming to Sterkspruit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> The time was up for our operation as our Commander told us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> When you're talking about your Commander, your Commander denied all regarding this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I can't answer you here because what you are telling me is that, you are not asking me questions, you are telling me what happened, and I'm not able to answer you because you are not asking me questions, you are telling me what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Yes I want to tell me, because there are some things you have been aware of, you might not have been aware of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The question as I understand it, is that after you had killed her father and Peter, you left that place because you had finished what you had gone there to do.  Is that right or wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, that's not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, did you do any more attacks on that road after this one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No there were not other attacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Did you launch any attacks since 1992 up to now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> The answer was no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Sorry, what was ...(inaudible) question, the one before this one, I couldn't hear it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MISS TSEMANE:</span> Did you launch any other attacks since 1992 up to now?  I thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MISS TSEMANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MTHEMBU:</span> ...(indistinct), Mr Chairperson.  Mr Makoala, you have mentioned Jabo on page 11 of your annexure to your application form.  Could you explain to this Committee about this Jabo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> The Jabo I talked about here is the other name of Dr Zam-Zam, but I've explained that there are other Jabos, they are other Comrades who used the name Jabo, but not in this attack where the Jabo I was talking about was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Are you then telling this Committee that the Jabo you referred to denotes more than one person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> According to my knowledge the Jabo I am talking about is Dr Zam-Zam, and what I have explained is that there were other Comrades who used the name Jabo, but not the Jabo I was with during the attacks I have talked about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Answer my question.  The question is, the Jabo you mentioned here, it is one person or more than one person, Mr Makoala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> He's answered you question Mr Mthembu, and it's that its exactly the same as his earlier evidence.  If you're trying to suggest to him that these might be more than one person, he's already given evidence to say that all the, they're, he implied that they were all the same person.  But, go ahead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That's all that I wanted to canvass, Mr Chairperson. Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Just on that one, Mr Mthembu.  Can I ask the applicant, right at page 12, under the column Lady Grey Ambush, which ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Page 11.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, page 11.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said 12.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Oh thank you, sorry, I said 12, I meant to say page 11.  Which Jabo is this that you are referring to at page 11?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Which operation are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> The Lady Grey Ambush.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> May you please repeat your question then so that I can answer you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Okay, you have mentioned a Jabo at that page.  Can you see that, can you see the name Jabo at page 11?  You mentioned it ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I can see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You've mentioned the name at least three times.  Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Okay, now let's start with the Jabo mentioned under Sterkspruit Hotel attack, can you see that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I can see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Which Jabo is this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> This is Zam-Zam I have been talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You go on to mention the name under the Lady Grey Ambush.  Do you see the name Jabo there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I can see the name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Which Jabo is that one?  Is that also Zam-Zam, or a different Jabo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I think this is where the error was committed when I wrote my amnesty application, because I have been involved in many operations.  Maybe I confused names here following operations that I was involved in.  I hope this is an error that was committed when I made my amnesty application, but all I know is that Jabo was not present during the Lady Grey Ambush.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You mentioned the name of Jabo again, that is under Lady Grey farm attack.  Was Lady Grey attack 2, do you see that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I can see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Which Jabo is that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> As I said earlier that, by the time I made my amnesty application, there were so many names in my mind.  And when I sat down and thought well about this I realised that Jabo was not present in this attack.  It was me, Scorpion and Kenny.  The Kenny I am talking about is not Phila Dolo, it is Kenny Modiboloa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> So once again you are making a mistake in mentioning the name of Jabo in this particular instance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Following the circumstances I was under when I made my amnesty application, it is true I was involved in many attacks, and I confused names and I was in a hurry when I made my amnesty application, worrying about the deadline for amnesty.  That is how I came to confuse names.  I started recalling events well when I sat, when I was sitting down at home with the other Comrades when we tried to help one another.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> ...(inaudible) about this Jabo whose name you mentioned several times, is that you were in a hurry when you were making this application, hence you even put in a wrong name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> I, on a different matter, I understand from my evidence you were wearing a white hat on the day in question.  Do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No I was not wearing a white hat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> I think that was the evidence of Mr Dolo yesterday that you were wearing a hat, a white hat, and you were using that hat to indicate whenever a vehicle driven by whites comes.  Was that not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I was not wearing a white hat.  Maybe he saw the hat I was wearing as white, but I would like to say that it was white, but it was so dirty that it wasn't white anymore.  Maybe he talked about its original colour, but by that time it was so dirty it was not as white as it were before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you, Mr Makoala.  That's all I've got to ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I just wanted to ask one thing, the, who was at your base during this time?  I want to just try and clarify this.  Which people were at your base at Jozanna's Hoek at this time?  Just give us a list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> During which time are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The time you were carrying out all these attacks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Do you want me to tell you their names of, or their number</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Let's start of, you were there, right?  You were there, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Roger was there, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now, Kenny was there.  Which Kenny are we talking about?  Were there two Kennys there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it was Kenny Modiboloa and Kenny, which Phila Dolo used to call him Kenny also.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And then there was Scorpion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, Scorpion was also there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And then there was Oupa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Oupa was also present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> What was Oupa's second name?  It looks like "K" something, but I can't read it on your annexure.  It's chopped off on my photocopy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> We called him Temba.  The other names he used, I don't know of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You wrote down on your application form a name beginning "Kho" I think.  How did it continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> The name is Khotle.  Oupa  Khotle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Khotle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Then we had Temba Ngese.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes Temba was also present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Is he different now to this Temba that you referred to as Oupa Khotle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes it is another Temba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And then you had Max.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Have I left anyone else out that was also there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, there are some names you've left behind. It is Comrade Jabo, whom we used to call Zam-Zam and the other Jabo whom I knew as Jabo and Ben.  From there the other Comrades would come and go, they wouldn't stay long at the base.  I didn't really know their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Are these people you've mentioned the only people involved ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> There was also Phila, but not Phila Dolo, Phila Pawa.  We used to call Phila Pawa Uys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Who are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Phila Pawa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What do you mean when you say he left earlier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> He was replaced by Phila Dodd, Dolo, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No he never left.  He was still around, but Comrade Phila Dolo was also one of the Commanders, that is the Regional Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> ...(inaudible) Phila Dolo yesterday, was that he returned to Umtata.  You were listening here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, he returned to Umtata.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Are you saying not immediately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I don't know when he returned to Umtata.  What happened is that after the attack we didn't sleep at the house or at the base.  That is all of us didn't sleep at the base.  So I don't know whether he returned immediately after the attack to Umtata or a few days thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You referring to this attack we're dealing with today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Are you saying that he was present from the time Phila Dolo took over till this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, he was still around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> What attacks did he take part in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I don't know which attacks he took part in.  All I know is that he was my Commander, one of the Regional Commanders before Comrade Phila Dolo arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Well did you go on any operations with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> With whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> We're talking about Phila Pawa now.   Did you go on any operations with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, Phila Pawa never accompanied me to any operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So who commanded you before Phila Dolo arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> It was Phila Pawa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So did you not go on any operations before Phila Dolo arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, it never happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now, you've mentioned two Jabos here.  Which of these other Comrades of yours used the name Jabo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> There were so many I can't tell the Committee who they are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> ...(inaudible) the name Jabo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I don't know whether in the earlier he was deployed in he used the name Jabo or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did he use the name Jabo at any time during an operation with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No I don't remember him using the name Jabo in the operations I was involved in with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> In any operation did Kenny ever use the name Jabo, that is Kenny Modiboloa?  Just a yes or a no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did Phila Dolo, who was also known as Kenny, did he ever use the name Jabo in an operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did Scorpion ever use the name Jabo in an operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did Oupa Khotle ever use the name Jabo in an operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did Temba ever use the name Jabo in an operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No he hadn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did Max ever use the name Jabo in an operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did Ben ever use the name Jabo in an operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And we won't worry about Phila because you never went on an operation with him, as you have told us.  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Even some of the Comrades you asked whether they used the name Jabo, I've never been out on an operation with them, like Comrade Ben.  I never went out on an operation with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You see, this annexure of yours only deals with operations, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> May you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> This annexure of yours at page 11 and 12 only deals with operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Only two people that you were involved in operations with used the name Jabo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What I explained earlier is that the Jabo I was with during operations is the one who is called Dr Zam-Zam.  The other Jabo I have never been with him on operations or during operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So there was only one Jabo you ever went on operations with, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes it is correct.  It is Dr Zam-Zam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> How could you confuse that Jabo with all the thousands of other Jabos you thought you were referring to?  You only went on operations with one.  Please explain this to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What I said is that by the time I made my amnesty application I was so confused, there was no-one helping or guiding me and by then I thought of many names.  The name that was nearer to my mind was Jabo because Jabo was my friend.  We were very close.  That is why on many occasions his name come up, came up my mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Is that Zam-Zam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, Mr, through you Mr Chairperson, I've got a few questions to ask you.  When Phila Dolo came, what role did the other Phila play in your unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> According to my knowledge Phila Pawa was still around in the house.  They shared the same responsibility, him and Comrade Dolo.  He used to conduct political classes.  Sometimes he will be around in the house, sometimes absent.  He wasn't with us all the time like Comrade Dolo.  Comrade Dolo was always present.  They would exchange their roles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> ...(inaudible) under, to whom were you accounting or reporting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I was accountable to both of them because they were sharing the same responsibilities.  But during operations I would account to Comrade Phila Dolo.  I would report to him after operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Then did you personally have any position or rank in the unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No I was an ordinary soldier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Just a coincidence that they chose you to go and give a signal.  Was it not any position of prominence that you were playing in the unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No it just happened that they pointed me out and I took the order as it came to me.  It's not that I was occupying a certain rank.  It just happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You told the Committee that you were not aware of the details of the operation until you arrived at the scene.  Did I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Only at the scene that you were then told you were going to attack cars whose occupants were white?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, we were only told of the nature of the operation when we arrived at the scene and we were also briefed on further details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> What would have happened to you if you refused to carry out that instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I couldn't refuse that.  I couldn't defy the order.  I took the order as it was and I was also willing to carry out the order.  Personally I had prepared myself for the  attack.  So there was no way that I could refuse the order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> In you affidavit did you say that you are 24 years of age.  Were you born in 1974?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> It is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> So in 1992 you were 18 years of age?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> The daughter to Mr Tsemane, the late Mr Tsemane, is putting to you that this thing has got, had nothing to do with any political objective.  In other words you were not motivated by any political considerations or carrying any policy decisions of the PAC, but you were targeting specific people there.  What is your, I mean response to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Sorry, Mr Sibanyoni, she didn't say that.  She in fact said that they were being used by people with a different agenda.  Sorry, if I could just say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Yes, thank you for putting it that way.  The daughter says there were people belonging to clubs and then they used you for their own motives.  What is your response to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> It is not so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> In your affidavit I see you have quoted the founding president of the PAC, Robert Sebukwe.  Thank you, thank you, Mr Chairperson.  Page 7 of the new bundle, paragraph 5 you are quoting the founding president of the PAC, Robert Sebukwe.  But the quote goes as far as the end of paragraph 5.  My question to you, is paragraph 6 your own words, or was it supposed to be the continuation of the quotation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> It continues.  The quotation continues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> So the whole of paragraph 6 is also part of what Robert Sebukwe said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> In your own words, what did you hope to achieve by killing these people which were killed on the 19th of November?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What I wanted to achieve was to make the then government aware that we are now in a war.  We were in a war to kill whites so that we can return the country to the, to its people.  We wanted to show the then apartheid government that we were engaged in a war with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> This Committee was shown two pictures, two photos.  In the photo there was Mr Schroeder and then in that picture he looks more, I means he looks dark.  He doesn't look more white.  In fact I would say he looks darker than myself.  What is you comment about that?  In other words my question is best to say it was not possible for you to make a mistake, to mistake him for a white person.  What do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Who is he on these two photos?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> He is standing on the extreme left on the picture shown to you.  My question is that it was not possible to mistake him for a white person.  He clearly looks not white.  What is your response?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What I can say is that as he was amongst white and his skin colour was a bit clear and as I have said that it was in the morning and misty.  One couldn't right away realise that that person was a Coloured because the car was moving by then.  It was not standing still.  Maybe if the car was not, was motionless, we could have been able to see whether he was a Coloured or a white person.   And if you can look at this picture you can see that this person's skin is clear.  He is a, he's white.  So one can't tell the difference between the person and a white person when this person is in a misty surrounding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> ...(inaudible) amongst white, which whites are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I thought the people in that bakkie were all white.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did Mrs Brummer look the same as Mr Schroeder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, because they are both white.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I would like to clear up a few matters.  Let's clear up the first one.  You said one of the problems, as I  understand your evidence, in seeing Mr Schroeder was that it was in misty surroundings in the morning.  Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So was it early in the morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I can't remember exactly what time it was, but if I can estimate, it was about something past seven.  I can't remember exactly what the time was, but because it was misty, it looked as if it was very early in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is usually misty in the morning in that part of the world.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> It was winter by then.  By the time we went there carrying out attacks, on that day it was misty, but on other days there was no mist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm afraid I have some difficulty in accepting that November was winter.  You agree it is not winter, it's well into summer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What I am trying to explain is that by then it was not really winter, but on that day it was cold.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) there was no mist in the morning.  I mean you could see clearly, couldn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Maybe if I was a Commander, I could have thought about that, but because I was not a Commander I couldn't give instructions on what to do.  I'll wait for the weather to clear up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And, as you have told us, it was early in the morning, just some time after seven.  Most of the people travelling to Sterkspruit at that time of day would have been workers, wouldn't they?  People going to work in Sterkspruit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I didn't know whether those people were going to Sterkspruit, or driving past.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But that is the time of day when people go to work, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> See, that's what's been suggested, is that you were targeting workers for some purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, we were not targeting workers.  We were targeting white people because on that day we were supposed to attack whites, not caring whether they work.  But the whole thing is that we were going attack whites.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you then, on a previous occasion you've told us, attacked some other person on that road with petrol bombs, but not cause any damage.  With molotov cocktails.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It appears from the information that that was Mr van Rooyen, who worked in Sterkspruit in the bakery.  And you've told us that was the only person you attacked on that day, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Dolo told us you attacked more than one person, but you have been quite adamant that you only attacked one person on that day, and that was the man from the bakery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> May you please repeat your question, sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> ...(inaudible) you have told us about, you are quite adamant you only attacked one person, one car driven by a white.  You threw molotov cocktails on it and then you went home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you were told who to attack by you Commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> May you please repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were told who to attack by your Commander.  He was there in charge of the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, you've told us a moment ago that you, as I recollect, you say that you were just a soldier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> It is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But on the first operation you went out on, you went out as a leader didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I think that was still about the operation at Lady Grey where I was a soldier.  We have not talked about other operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were a leader on the first operation you went out, weren't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> As I have said that I have been involved in operations, I can't remember which operation came first and which one came second.  Can you please remind me, Mr Chairman, which one is the first operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In your statement you made, which has been referred to a number of times, you said it was to go and set a farm on fire, and Phila told you that you would be the leader.  You went out with petrol bombs and pangas.  Do you remember it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.  I can't interpret.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Page 37, annexure "B", bottom portion of the page.  Are you showing it to him, Mr Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) that you had in fact discussed this statement with him.  He is aware of the contents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, you've told us about the leaders of units who you went on operations with, but who gave you general instructions as to the aims of APLA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> We used to receive instructions from Comrade Phila Pawa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Pawa, Phila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And who was higher up the train?</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> By then Comrade Phila Dolo had not arrived in our unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You ...(inaudible) in you application form, page 1, paragraph 11(b), you set out the details of this.  Are you reading what you set out there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I'm reading it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is what you set out there correct?  Were these orders issued by ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And who then issued the orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> It was Comrade Phila Dolo.  When he gave us these instructions we were sitting together with Comrade Lethlapha Mphahlele, but the person who was giving out the instructions, the Comrade I was under, he was Comrade Phila Pawa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What you say in your application is the orders were issued by Mr L Mphahlele.  That's what you say there, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is the truth.  Comrade Mphahlele was a High Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Can I, sorry, Mr Chairperson.  Can I take you to the incident where the lady teachers were stopped, and I am referring you to page no 13 of the second bundle, and I just want to get a clear picture as to how they were stopped.  Because according to Mrs Booysens you people pointed firearms at them, but according to the affidavit of Mosesiwe Dlepu, I will read it ...(inaudible)</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a>"when we're talking about that vehicle, there appeared four men hiking to our vehicle and they were hiking, coming towards our vehicle.  Mrs Booysen stopped the vehicle since the said men, they were blocking the road"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a>Where you all in the middle of the road, all four of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> We were not all in the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> But ...(inaudible) Mr Dolo raised his right hand.  What actions did you do, what did you do the other three of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I was standing next to him by then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> The other two, what did they do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> We were on one side of the road, all of us, although we were not standing in the same area.  It is me and Comrade Dolo who went to the car.  The other two were standing a bit away from the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  No, I'm sorry, one other point.  Mr Mthembu we have as you know, you've been given a copy some time ago, we've all been given copies, of the confession, it's called, that he made.  There's nothing in that that he wants to raise, is there?  I don't propose to put the whole of it to him, but if there's anything that you think ought be raised, this is your opportunity to raise it.  Various portions have been put to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Chairman, my instructions of that statement is that the statement was not made voluntarily as such, but it was initiated through torture and other means, but not the whole contents thereof.  Some aspects of it are indeed the truth, like for instance the personal ...(indistinct) of the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you have no objections to the reference to it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Just one last question, Chairperson.  The handwriting on this form, your application form, that's not your handwriting is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, it is not my handwriting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Whose handwriting is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> It is Oupa Khotle's handwriting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I thought you said you filled this form out on your own?  That was your evidence to us earlier.  No-one helped you fill it out you said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> What happened is that I was reading the story to him and he would write what I was saying.  The reason for this is that I can't write English correctly.  I can't understand English correctly, or well.  But what happened is that I was reading the story to him and he was writing what I was saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Are you sure that this is not Mr Mbandwa's handwriting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> No, what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, I don't know Mbandwa.  I know only Oupa who helped me to write my story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mbandwa is a lawyer that went around helping people fill out their application forms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> No, I don't know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You said Oupa assisted you to complete this form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You were telling him what to put in the form, what to say in the form and he was writing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> His work was only to write, it was me who was reading the story to him.  He would translate what I was saying in Sotho to English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> At the end of that exercise did the two of you go together through the statement to see if, through the application form, I'm sorry, to see if it reflected correctly what you have said to him he must write in the application form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, he read it to me, trying to explain to me what I have said to him and I agreed with him with everything and then the application was made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> I take it that even at that stage he was simply telling you what he had written in the application form, because you cannot really read English, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I believe that he was telling me all truth about what was written there, because he is my Comrade.  He wouldn't lie to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> He was your Comrade.  He was present with you at your base for some of this time, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> He even did an operation with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> Yes, I once went with him to an operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So he would have had personal knowledge of some of the facts in here?  Because he was present at your base, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOALA:</span> I think he only knew about one operation where he accompanied me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> No further questions, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Mr Chairman, that is Mr Makoala's testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, I notice it is 12h45.  I intend calling members of, or a member of Mr Tsemane's family.  I have made contact with Mr Schroeder's family.  I understand the brother-in-law will be coming to see me shortly.  Would this be an opportune time to take the lunch adjournment now, and then to reconvene possibly at 13h30.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you'll also have the necessary police and other evidence, the medical evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I'll be, I'll endeavour to have that, I ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And we have photographs of pointings out, but not were of what was pointed out, and really they are very little value without someone giving evidence as to what they in fact show, and the post mortem report, as you well know, are nearly illegible, and it may well be of some importance to have medical evidence as to the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, we will adjourn now till 13h30.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before we start, I would like to make a few remarks.  We have been given a copy of a statement. Apparently for the purposes of ensuring that it is delivered directly to Mr Dullah Omar, the Minister of Justice.  I would like to explain that we have no direct contact with the Minister and no method of ensuring direct delivery to him, and I would suggest that those people who wish to make contact with him, do so through the Department of Justice itself.  I hope they understand what I'm saying in this regard and we shall however endeavour to bring it to the attention of interested parties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, I wish to call Mr Oelofse regarding the photographs which appear from page 17 of bundle "B", 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and I hand up to the Committee a statement of Mr Oelofse, in which he just incorporates, encapsulates the pointings out in an affidavit and may that affidavit be marked "C".  Mr Oelofse wishes to give evidence in Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> That's fine.  Would you please rise Mr Oelofse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> (duly sworn in states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Oelofse is it correct that you are in service of the South African Police Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> I'm at the Crime Information Service at Aliwal North, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Is it correct that during October 1995 you were entrusted with the investigation into this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> On the 10th of October 1995 at 07h30 in the morning you and Mr Gomada from the former Transkei Police Force as well as Sergeant Adoons and Mrs Dlephu went to the Sterkspruit side of the Lady Grey Sterkspruit Road in order to point out certain points.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I'm now referring, did you organise that an air photo should be taken of the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Maybe we can go back to the air photo at a later stage.  If you turn to page 18, is that Mrs Dlephu who stands there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Which point is she showing there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> She's pointing out where the vehicle in which she was driving and the other vehicle, the Telkom vehicle, their position, as well as the position of the attackers when they shot at them.  That's the shooting took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And Mrs Dlephu, was the one of the teachers in the bakkie who was then heisted, or hijacked?  If you turn to page 19, that's photo 3, photograph 3 that's Sergeant Adoons and the other police officer, Mr Gomada?</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And what are they referring to there?  Which point are they showing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That's the point where Mr Schroeder's body on the tarmac was found.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Is it correct, in the backdrop you see a little bridge there, and in evidence the previous referred to that bridge, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And then page 20.  The place where the two gentlemen are standing, now that's off the bridge, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> Yes, that's in the donga underneath the bridge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And what are they pointing out there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That is where the bakkie and the bodies of Mr Tsemane and Mrs Brummer was found.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And that corresponds with the photographs of the bakkie which we can see on page 23 and page 24?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And that's in bundle "B".  Then page 21, is that where, the point where Sergeant Gomada and Adoons are standing, is that where Mr Schroeder was lying, but from the Lady Grey side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> No, that's the position where the first attack initially took place and where the vehicle came to a standstill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> In other words that was the bakkie Mr Schroeder was driving?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I'm now coming to the aerial photograph, and I'm going to ask Mr Oelofse to identify photographs 18, 19, 20, 21, that is the pointings out.  May I possibly, unfortunately we have the original before us which was marked a short while ago.  Points A, B and C, but those points do not appear on the Committee's bundles.  I don't know whether we should mark them now, or maybe show the original around, possibly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a>   Mr Oelofse I refer to the aerial photo which appears on page 17 of bundle "B" and that's photograph 1 in the original bundle.  In the foreground at the bottom of the page, that's where ...(indistinct) is situated, not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And if you go up with the road and you cross the bridge and that's toward Sterkspruit, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now on the original photograph the point where Mr Schroeder's bakkie came to a standstill and the points which appear on page 21.  Where is that point on the aerial photograph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> It would be point A. If you look at the photograph there are two vehicles and another vehicle a bit further on.  That's the relevant vehicle pointed out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There appears to be white line going across the photograph.  Yes.  So is that vehicle parked on the road where Schroeder's car was found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That was a schematic representation of the point that was shown to me and then a vehicle was placed there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now the second point, must now the two, Mr Adoons and Gomada pointed out to you, that point which we find on page 19.  Where's that point on the aerial photograph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That's just above the, halfway through the photograph.  The beginning of the two white lines which indicate the rails next to the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The top part of that double barrier, or the bottom part?  I'm just not clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> It's at the bottom, bottom point.  It's on the right hand side, next to the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And then the third point which Mrs Dlephu pointed out to you, that's now where, where the teachers engaged the attackers.  That's point C, not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And where does that, where can we find that point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> If you look, if you look at point, go from point B and you follow the road towards Sterkspruit then the road makes a turn, and then there's holes next to the road.  That would be the position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> ...(inaudible) the points marked for the Committee and my learned friends' attention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a>   Mr Oelofse ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is point B, that is where Schroeder's body was found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And it wasn't the photograph taken from the Sterkspruit side of the bridge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> Yes.  It's taken from the Sterkspruit side</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) standing on that side of the bridge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That is correct.  That's the Sterkspruit side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> B is at presently marked on the other side.  I don't know if I just ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, it was my mistake.  B is where the vehicle was found off the road, I do apologise.  The body was found beyond the white rails on the Sterkspruit side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Up towards where car C was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, so I do apologise to the Committee.  Maybe can we mark that point D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And which car was found at your original B?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> It was the bakkie of Mr Tsemane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it found down on the bottom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Down, down in the donga yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a>   Mr Chairman I don't want there to be any confusion.  On the aerial photograph the two solid white lines that are about an inch in length do not depict the bridge.  It's the barrier lines on the curve, on the ascent.  Crash barriers, yes.  So the body was just below that, according to, maybe Mr Oelofse can clarify that.  I don't want there to be confusion.  Because, sorry, the, in photograph 3, that's at page 19, one sees the bridge behind the two witnesses pointing out.  Those aren't crash barriers which one sees clearly on the aerial photograph.  I don't know if that's clear, but the body was found between the bridge and the crash barriers. </p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> If we understand you correctly, if the person who took this photograph number 3 were to turn around and face in the other direction, what you would see would be those crash barriers that are quite evident on this aerial photograph.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Maybe Mr Oelofse ...(inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> Can you just repeat that please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What I'm trying to find out is the crash barriers that are very evident on the aerial photograph has two very obvious white lines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Are they further above where these two gentlemen are standing, or actually in the, in the direct, or actually, they are facing in the direction of those crash barriers.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That's correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So not behind them.  It's in fact in front of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So what I had said was if the person who took the photograph had turned around and taken another photograph the other way, you would clearly see those crash barriers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I just want to go back to photograph 2.  I just want to be clear in my own mind.  There are 3 points marked on that photograph.  Mrs Tsemane is pointing to the middle, at least Mrs Dlephu is pointing to the middle one.  What exactly do those three beacons represent again?  Just help me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> Chairman if you look at that photo, I'm not quite, if you look at 2(a) on page 18, that's the schematic representation of the vehicles as they were, and at the middle point there's and, there's indicators to which Mrs Dlephu is pointing.  That's where the attackers were at that point and when they fired at the other vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Which, there's one vehicle across the road at right angles to the road, and there's one vehicle in the lane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now which ...(inaudible) represent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> The one at right angles represents the vehicle in which Mrs Dlephu was driven, driving.  The other one was a representation of the vehicle which stopped.  That of Mr Selly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> That's according to Mrs Dlephu's recollection of how far apart they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And the applicants and their Comrades were in the middle, roughly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That's correct, you honour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> It's much clearer, thank you very much.  Are you able to give us an estimate of what distance is covered by this aerial photograph, from point A to roughly point C?  Did you measure that out at all as far as you can recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> I cannot remember exactly what the distances were, but round about a kilometre from A to B and just less that a kilometre from B to C.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I just want to get clarity.  The body of Mr Schroeder, if we can mark it D on the aerial photo, was just underneath the left barrier as it, you pointed it out on photo 17.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Just to help us again.  If one would take the centre point on the bridge.  How far would that point be from that, approximately?  If we look at photograph 3 we can see that, but there may be some foreshortening.  I don't want to get it wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> I cannot remember exactly, but it wasn't very far.  I would say around 50 metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Oelofse if I can just focus your attention on bundle "A", photos 43, 44 and 45.  Where you involved in those pointing outs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> No, I wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> But as those scenes are depicted are they the same ones as the ones we have just referred to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you tell us in 43 what is he pointing out there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> It shows the same bridge where the vehicle of Mr Tsemane and Brummer ended up in the donga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) understanding is of no importance.  He's not ...(inaudible) on the spot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The same on 44.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> Chairperson 44 indicates the position and is pointing to where the vehicle was lying in the ditch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then why are the lampposts there, or telephone,</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) rock there.  Is that the same rock as we're been looking at in "B" 23?</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That is correct.  It's the same rock that's lying there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Oelofse you didn't see this vehicle represented in "B" 23 at all, did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, may I be of some assistance.  The photographs put up in bundle "A", those are photographs, I beg your pardon, photographs 43 and 44.  I have the original bundle and the index simply refers to points 1 to 18.  There were several pointings out and there is no detail as to what in fact there was pointing out.  My understanding is that it seems that Mr Makoala took to the Police to various points, but there is no specific reference to what occurred at that point as far as the index is concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a>   May I just refer the Committee to page 35 of the bundle "A".</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you say 35?</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Page 35.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you finished?</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any cross-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Mr Chairman I don't know what to, I've been trying my best to follow it, but I must consider I got lost somewhere about this whole thing.  It makes me, puts me in a very difficult position to ask any questions regarding this sketches, but except to just to ask one point I think if I am not mistaken Mr Lax has asked.  Can you, I'm not sure, the Committee will correct me if I'm wrong.  Can you estimate the distance between the bridge and point B.  If, what was the distance between the bridge and point B?</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> You Honour, it is difficult to say.  If I could make an estimate, it would be 20 metres from the side of the bridge up to where the vehicle was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> It would be the same distance, would it not, as it appears in the second, lower photo on "B" 23?  The distance there is fairly clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> Yes, that is a straight line from the bridge up to where the vehicle is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> ...(inaudible) from the bridge can you also just roughly tell us from point, from point D to the bridge, can you estimate the distance?  I know the distance you said is long, but I wanted just those.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> It is approximately from the middle of the</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a>bridge 50 metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> I know I said finally, Mr Chairman, but can you, am I correct to say that you were trying to reconstruct the incident that happened in 1992, three years thereafter with the lady who was involved in the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR OELOFSE:</span> That is correct.  Those were the points that they showed me and where we marked them and took the photographs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> No questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman I hoped to have called Mr Fransisco who was a colleague of Mr van Rooyen from the bakery in Sterkspruit.  Either he is not yet arrived.   I then wish to call Miss Alda Tsemane, this is another sister.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MS H TSEMANE:</span> I'm ...(indistinct) from Bloemfontein.  I'm the eldest daughter of Mr James Tsemane.</p>

<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Madam, is it correct, you are the daughter of the deceased in this matter, Mr James Tsemane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MS H TSEMANE:</span> Yes, I'm the eldest daughter of the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You are talking on behalf of your widowed mother, Mrs Tsemane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MS H TSEMANE:</span> No, I'm talking on behalf of all the Tsemane children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Where you at the time of your father's tragic death of the 19th of November 1992, where were you living?</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MS H TSEMANE:</span> I was in Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And we understand from what we've heard that your father lived in Sterkspruit.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MS H TSEMANE:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And he worked at a bakery in Sterkspruit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MS H TSEMANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Do you know, or do you remember the name of that bakery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MS H TSEMANE:</span> No, I don't remember the name of the bakery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, you've indicated that you'd like to talk on behalf of the children of the deceased.  Could you proceed then and ask questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MS H TSEMANE:</span> I would like to talk directly to the applicant.  I wonder whether Mr Martin and James know of the cost to the people of the family members of the deceased.  I'm not expecting answers from them, but I would like to hear how they feel about what they did.  My father wasn't into politics.  He was a very respected person in the community.  He had no discrimination against anyone.  He worked for his family and the community.  He was also an assistant to "Sebota".  My father never killed anyone to help the other person.  He took my mum's friend away from her and many children.  Some of these children had to leave school because they had financial problems.  Presently as I am speaking here some of the children who have finished school were helped by the white person that you hated.  Even your, even you own brothers and sisters are being helped by white guys whom your parents worked for, work for.  I would like to withdraw from killing white people.  We have learnt a lot of things from white people, whether they are bad or good.  My sister asked James whether he was asking for forgiveness from us only, although my father and Ms Brummer got killed, whose blood mixed in the car.  As I understand you mixed the blood of the two people to make a sacrifice for freedom.  Now how do you divide the blood of the two deceased when you ask for forgiveness from only us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> We must apologise for that sound you keep hearing on your machine.  It's caused by the electrical power, it's not very stable, unfortunately, so it's nothing we can do about it.  Just so that everyone understands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prior, I don't want to stop this witness from continuing to tell us this, but is this the right stage of the proceedings?  Is she going to give us any evidence dealing with the merits of the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Unfortunately I was going to call Miss Alda Tsemane, and this lady came in her stead.  I hadn't precognised her at all, but I think she, having commenced, I don't think she's got very far to go, and ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, we'll continue, but then I think we should take care of other witnesses at this stage, deal with the merits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, I'm alive to that.  Well she going to be, if we stop her now, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let her continue if you say she hasn't much longer to go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Please proceed ma'am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MS H TSEMANE:</span> As I said that you've mixed the blood of these two deceased and you want to divide it again.  My father died because of a white person.  I wonder how are you going to die, you.  What is the death that is accepted in heaven?  We are unable to forgive you because you ask for forgiveness about things we have already forgotten about.  You are only causing us heartbreak about the past.  You were only out to please your Comrades, that you call Africans, whose names you don't want to disclose.  All you want to do is to appear on TV.  I can't see any truth in what you've said.  Let justice take its course against you.  This is your own medicine.  Taste it.  We thank the Truth Commission because today we know how our dad died.  You the killers, I am merciful to your parents because no parents want to bore, or to bear a killer.  I thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I take it you have no questions yet.</p>

<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you Madam.  I call Miss Alda Tsemane.</p>

<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Miss Tsemane, I just need some information about your father.  We understand he was married to your mother.  You mother still is living, is that correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, she's still alive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> During 1992 at the time of his death, he was living with your mother in Sterkspruit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you also live in the Sterkspruit area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> How many children did your father and mother have?  Can you just tell the Committee, how many daughters, how many sons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> We are many.  I think we were eighteen.  There were five sons and thirteen daughters.  All in all we are eighteen and one has passed away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Were you a close family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now, Mr Chairman, may I just ask that the public, particular the second row, they seem to find the evidence of this witness particular amusing.  If the public would just be reminded that this is quite a difficult time for the family and that they respect that feeling of the family, please.  I'm indebted to the Committee.  I hope that's been translated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a>   Miss Tsemane, your father worked at the bakery, is that correct?   In Sterkspruit.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, it is true, he worked at the bakery, until his death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And how long had he worked there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> He started working there in 1970.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And we understand, we've heard that Mr van Rooyen was, was he the owner or the manager of the bakery?  He also worked there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> He was the manager of the bakery.  Initially the bakery belonged to Jimmy Nathan, and when he left he left it with Mr van Rooyen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Louis Fransisco, was he also employed at the bakery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And did you know those two men?   Apart from just knowing of them, did you know them on a personal basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> I only knew that as working at the bakery, because they stayed in Lady Grey, not Sterkspruit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And like Mrs Brummer, is it correct they commuted on a daily basis from Lady Grey to Sterkspruit to work at their respective employment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, it is so.  They used to go to their work places everyday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now, in questions that you've put to Mr Makoala this morning, you indicated that Mr van Rooyen, at least, had been involved in an attack, and it seems that that was an attack referred to by the applicants where they were trying out their petrol bombs.  Did you know of that incident from what the community was saying, or from any information that came to your attention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> As I said earlier, I said Mr van Rooyen was working with my dad.  That's how I came to know of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Do you know if Mr Fransisco was involved in any incident on that road while going to Sterkspruit to the bakery?  If you don't know about that then say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, I also heard about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, Mr Fransisco will be coming to the Committee to tell us about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a>Now Mrs Brummer, you told me yesterday that you knew Mrs Brummer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, I knew Mrs Brummer.  I used to work next-door to her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And did any member of your family work at the same shop as Mrs Brummer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, my sister and my auntie used to work together with Mrs Brummer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now, Mrs Brummer's widower, Mr Brummer, has indicated that he does not wish to attend these proceedings.  He indicated in a letter that he is still suffering.  Are you able to just tell us a little bit about Mrs Brummer?  How was she regarded by the community at Sterkspruit?  And I am referring to the black community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> We received Mrs Brummer as one of our, as one of us.  The only difference was her skin colour.  For example she could speak Xhosa, she would only speak English when speaking to her husband and those who worked for her.  Every time he went to the shop he would be accompanied by people, mostly people like us.  He was always with us because by then we had forgotten that he was a white person because of his behaviour amongst us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> ...(inaudible) Mrs Brummer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The Speaker's microphone is not on.  I can't interpret.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> If you want me to tell you about both of them, all I can say is that they were the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> In ...(inaudible) interpretation said "he" and not "she".  We thought you were, we weren't sure if you were talking about Mrs Brummer or Mr Brummer when you were saying "he was always with us" and that sort of thing, so I'm just not clear.  Can you clarify that?  Are you referring to Mrs Brummer or Mr Brummer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> I was talking about Mrs Brummer because I thought I was being asked about her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And Mr Schroeder, did you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, I knew him.  I knew him from Fourways when I was working next-door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The photographs, can you identify Mr Brummer on these photographs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The photograph I wish to tender as EXHIBIT, as D, sorry, yes, D and I mark it D(1).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a>   He's standing in a grey suite, is that correct?  At a wedding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.  It is him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> On D2 he's standing on the right hand side of the photograph next to the lady with the baby.  He's in a white T-shirt with, it looks like short pants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, it is him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did he also work with Mrs Brummer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> It is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And how did, what was his employment?  What was his, did he also work for Fairways, or Score, sorry, Score Furnishers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> He was working at Score.  He came after it came to the light that Mrs Brummer was about to be transferred when he arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Schroeder was a Coloured man, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> We heard evidence regarding the applicants and where they stayed in Jozanna's Hoek.  Did you know that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, I know the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Directions or description of how, or directions how to get, an explanation of how to get to the house was given by both applicants.  Are you able to identify that house from that, that evidence that you heard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Do you know the owner of that house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, I know the owner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You also in your questioning of the applicants, well particularly, no, not, I rephrase that, Mr Makoala.  It seems, you seem to suggest in those questions that the attacks carried out before the 19th of November where Mr Fransisco and Mr van Rooyen were involved and then, Mr Brummer, Mrs Brummer, Mr Schroeder and your father, Mr Tsemane, was part of a, if I can put it, a conspiracy of sorts to effectively get rid of the white people working in Sterkspruit.  In other words, only those people working in Sterkspruit were targeted.  That seems to, what I understand from your question.  Am I right in that understanding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, you are right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Is there any information that you have for this Committee regarding those questions that you actually put to the applicant this morning, or the reasons why you put that to the applicant?  Are you able to give us some indication why you put those questions?  Whether there's any information out there that is available to the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> As I've said earlier, I was born here and I grew up here and I attended school in Sterkspruit, and I'm also working there.  I know people of Sterkspruit very much.  I started to work in a store in 1977.  I know all the business people in Sterkspruit.  What made me to ask him the question I was asking, is because I used to hear about everything that happened in town because I was most of the times in town, as I worked there.  That is why I asked those questions.  And I also realised that there was something they were hiding away.  When I asked him where he was accommodated when he first arrived, before he was taken to Jozanna, because Jozanna is outside town, which is a veld that they could use for their training.  I think that they knew where they got accommodation when they first arrived.  I think I asked earlier when he could deny when I said I used to see him earlier on.  Especially when the schools were closed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Where did you see Mr Mokoala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> I saw him entering a shop.  He was one of the people who used to frequent the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you recognise the first applicant, Phila Martin Dolo, or Martin Phila Dolo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> No, I won't say I know him.  There were so many people entering that place, I couldn't know all of them, because there was nothing I was suspecting at that time.  But I knew that they belonged to the PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When you say "they" who are you referring to?  You knew that "they" were belonging to the PAC.  Who was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> I am talking about the boys who used to frequent that place.  We knew that they belonged to the PAC.  They used to wear PAC T-shirts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The Sterkspruit Hotel, I think it was also called the Moleko Hotel, did you know that that hotel has also been robbed or attacked?  The people in that hotel, the employees?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, I know the hotel had been attacked once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you know who the owners were of that hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> From 1987 until 1991 I was working for Tamaleko, who was the site-owner, but the hotel was built by white people, and the control was with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And after this attack, do you know what happened to the white people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> No, I don't know what happened to them.  I just couldn't see them anymore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> When you say that, did you not see them in Sterkspruit anymore after that attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> No, I didn't see them again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Sterkspruit Garage.  We understand from Mr Makoala that that was also attacked in 1992.  Did you know about that?  Did you get to learn about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> I just hear from this sitting that the Sterkspruit Garage was also attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Could you tell us who the owner was of that garage during 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> From 1977 up to 1987 in July I was working for Mr Charles Nathan, who was the owner of that garage.  He has his brother called Duncan Nathan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And after that, do you know who was the owner?  Did he sell it ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> No, they never left.  They were always there, and Mr Duncan Nathan was most of the time there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Is there anything else you wish to tell the Committee about this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> What matter are you referring to, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The death of your father and who may have been responsible, or anything around that.  Anything additional to what you've told us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> I don't think there is anything that I can say because I have already asked the applicants how he feel about my father's death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> ...(inaudible) at this time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> It seems like there is nothing I want to add.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think I would like to explore something before she's cross-examined.  I think it would be unfair to leave it last, because I understood that when she was asking questions she named certain persons and she also put it to the applicants that they were being used in some way.  Shouldn't that be investigated at this stage, Mr Prior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I'm indebted to the Committee.  You indicated who Mr Makoala, the name of the person who owned the house at which they were house.  I think it was Mr Pitso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You also indicated that, in your view, as you put it,</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> Repeat your question, Sir, I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> But also Mr Mbele-Mbele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MS A TSEMANE:</span> I know Mr Mbele-Mbele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> ...(inaudible) Committee can guide me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Developed now, and I think it's something that has to be investigated.  I think they should be notified that their names have been raised if they wish to come and make any further representations.  But I don't see how one can, if one is going to properly investigate what this witness appears to be raising, unless you suggest the whole matter be adjourned at this stage pending notice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, I'm just alive to the decisions that have been handed down and the developments in the past, where, where people's identities have been revealed in the Committees also unexpectedly and where evidence has been led, or information has been given which is prejudicial to those people.  I believe the, I believe they ought to be covered by Section 19 of the Act.  That's why I'm loathed to possibly at this stage without any notice to them, to go to, I don't know what this witness is going to say.  Maybe I should ask for a short adjournment that I may precognise her on this aspect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And Mr Mbele-Mbele was mentioned in the papers that were put before us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> But he hadn't been given notice as a ...(intervention) CHAIRPERSON:   No, but he has already been mentioned in the statements.  We'll take a short adjournment for you to precognise the witness properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prior, I have had an opportunity of considering the matter, also of talking to the other persons representing the applicants.  And it seems that if we proceed with this, other names may be mentioned of people who have had, not had notice, and I think it would be grossly unfair to them to proceed with it.  Particularly when there hasn't been a full investigation and we don't know whether the, if any allegations are made, whether they can be justified.  What I propose and the members of the Committee agree with me, is that we adjourn this matter temporarily to Tuesday for you to ascertain whether the matter is worth investigating fully, if so, how long it will take and matters of that nature, and we can decide on a final date next Tuesday.  Do you have anything to say in that regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, those were my fears at that stage, that's why I raised the matter.  I'm in agreement with the Committee and I think that should be followed, that route.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, in the light of the fact that evidence is now being led, it was foreshadowed by the cross-examinations that other parties might be involved, and I stress the word "might", there is at present time no evidence before us showing</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a>that any other party has committed any wrongful act, but it is a matter that clearly should be investigated and if necessary, proper notice given to the parties mentioned, which will necessitate as we all know, a further adjournment of the matter.  So rather than cause more difficulties at the present time, we will adjourn till next Tuesday for preliminary enquiries to be made and to ascertain how long it shall take to investigate the matter fully and when we can conclude the hearing.  Mr Mbandazayo, do you have anything to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> None, Mr Chairman, I, nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Nothing Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You, nothing further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, there is just one aspect that bothers me, or concerns me, is the fact that two names have been given up in evidence and I would ask the Committee to give a ruling whether the media, what weight they attack to that, because already I think the fact of the adjournment may alert the media to, to whatever ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think the names that have been mentioned, have only been the names of ...(inaudible).  We have not got to the stage of any evidence on other aspects, which is why we're adjourning.  We're not adjourning because they stayed at point A or point B.
