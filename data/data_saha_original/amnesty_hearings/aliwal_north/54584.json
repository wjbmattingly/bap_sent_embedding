Mr Chairman, may I just for the record place the following on record, the notices were sent out, the section 19 notices, to victims.  The deceased in this matter was a Mr Smit who died during this operation, during this attack.  His widow was informed, and she obtained the services of Mr Jan Wagenaar, attorney with Wagenaar, Muller and Du Plessis of Pretoria.  My I place on record, Mr Chairman, that Mr Wagenaar had certain difficulties.  This matter was set down for hearing for last week, but we accommodated him and set it down for today onwards.  I, he is not present and I phoned him at the luncheon adjournment and he indicated that he would not be appearing because of certain difficulties he had had in obtaining funding of his client through the Legal Aid.  Mr Chairman, I don't think this is the time to go into the merits of what Mr Wagenaar told me, I accept what he has said to me there.  I know that there was some difficulties that he had, or some objections that he had voiced to the TRC, and those were taken up with the relevant officers there.  Suffice to say that he is not appearing.  His client has been informed about the position and there is no appearance from the widow of Mr Smit.  I indicated to him nevertheless that this matter as in the case of the other matters would be postponed to hear evidence from the PAC or APLA High Command, and he indicated that at that stage he my well have been properly instructed and my appear at that stage, but that decision would be made at a later time.  The other victims that were involved was a Mr Deon Maartens who was in the vehicle driven by Mr Smit, unfortunately he has since passed away in a motor accident unrelated to this event.  A Mr A Franzsen who is present today and a Mr B Maliehe, he has been given notice, but we've had no feed back from him as to whether he wants to appear in the matter or not.  The implicated person is as in the other matter, Mr Mphahlele and he is present.  Thank you Mr Chairman.",

There are many things that took place, more especially the Africans at large, things that were ...(indistinct) by the Government of the day.  If people can remember there were even laws that were passed where the Africans would be placed in the reserved areas, the remote areas.  With the aim of surplus labour for the farmers and the other industries that were in there.  And another purpose was to make sure that they subsidise the wages of the migrant workers.  In order for them to control the influx of the Africans, as they made the Africans strangers in their own land, they were saying that the Africans cannot stay in this land because the land was too hot and they cannot go the Heaven, because Heaven is too far also.  The industrial areas called BIC or RIC were established, Border Industrial Corporations or Reserved Industrial Corporations.  There was a law that was passed that a white man will always be a manager and a black man will work under him, but when you look at this thing, this person was actually managing the oppression of the Africans, because the Africans, the aim was to keep the Africans away.  We were doing those operations, my political understanding is that we were doing those operations due to those reasons, those factors.  Concerning the families of the deceased, it would be painful if they are not here today.  I sympathise with them because of such actions, because when a person dies, it's quite a big thing, and we know that it's very easy to destroy a life of a person.

When I explain it further about your question whether a white, we were not killing this person because we hated him as a white person per se because the nature of our struggle was not a racial struggle, but the orientation of whites is that because they were the ones who were killed, they thought that it was a racial struggle, because we didn't define in any ...(indistinct) because her or his colour as it is written in our books that you do not hate the \"sjambok\", but you hate the man who is using it.

I'll go back, I think I have explained that when you take this back from the forced removals when the land was taken from the Africans by people like you at the time, we were taken as people who did not belong here.  We were Bantu's and we were taken to the Bantu areas or the so-called reserved areas.  This South Africa was for the whites.  Even if you stayed twenty or thirty years, or you were born in that area, you did not belong there.  If you were Xhosa speaker you would go to Transkei or Ciskei, if you were Sotho speaker, you were taken to Qwa-Qwa.  What happened is that the whites tried that they were - there was a competition at the time of black unskilled labourers, because they were also unskilled labourers.  But because the capitalists who were building the factories, they found out that the pressure that was exerted by whites because these people were supposed to be given high wages, because of their status - there is something that they call the colour-bar.  They say \"my kleur is my val\" - that my colour is my status.  The African whether he is qualified, he will remain a Kaffir.  They said that these people had to be taken to the reserved areas so that they cannot come to South Africa, so that they can build industries in the areas that these people are staying, or near to them, because there would be a surplus of a work force and they would get low wages.  That is an exploitation, because the capitalist was more interested in profit.  A white man was supposed to be in a managerial position.  Even when a black person is educated, but a white man would be a manger.  When I am saying that they were administering the unjust laws, they were administering the influx laws.  The question would come now, that at the time the apartheid law was crashed, the law was crashed in the books, but practically it was not removed.  As the Africans were not fighting against apartheid per se, but were fighting against our land for the whole nation.  I don't know whether you understand it.\n\tOn a military point view, the time I was killing these people, these people were trained personnel, even though before the operation I did not have their profile, because it was not part and parcel of the recognisance of the target.",
