May I inform the Committee that Mr Griesel was injured in that attack, not fatally, he has subsequently died, he committed suicide, Mr Chairman, if that evidence will be forthcoming - that's why on the schedule before you in brackets \"deceased\" appears there.\n\tThe two other victims who were with Mr Griesel at the time were Mr Tladi and Mr Ndeleni have been informed.  Mr Ndeleni is present and I understand Mr Tladi had worked night shift and was unable to attend this morning and in no doubt if necessary his presence will be secured.  The victim Mr Ndeleni will rely on the services of the evidence leader, that is myself, P.C.

I would not like to comment on the state of those preliminary investigations at this stage but in my view I think the matter needs to be fully canvassed and we'll require some time.  \n\tMay the matter then stand adjourned, sine die, with the date to be arranged with all the legal representatives and the interested parties as soon as those investigations have been completed?",
