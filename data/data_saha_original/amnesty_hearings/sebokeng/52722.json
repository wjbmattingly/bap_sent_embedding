If the applications and even if there is a connection between this document and the previous document, my submission is that the applications must stand or fall by what was submitted to the TRC prior to the cut off date and I understand my learned friends' heads of argument, at least we're agreed on that, that the validity or otherwise of the applications must be judged in the light of a document which was submitted timeously.  Now the Committee has a copy of one of those applications and we have been told that they are all identical.  Our submissions are that Section 20 of the Act sets up three jurisdictional requirements for Amnesty.\na)\t That it must comply with the requirements of the act, the application.\n\tb)\tThat is must be an act associated with a political objective\n\tc)\tThat there must be full disclosure.\nThe basis of the argument is that those are three separate jurisdictional facts, each of which has to be satisfied in order for the Committee to be in a position to grant amnesty.\n\tThe Act in Section 20 says that if the Committee is satisfied on those three jurisdictional facts then it shall grant amnesty.  The use of the word \"shall\" is instructive because it would seem that at that stage, once those three jurisdictional facts are satisfied, then the Committee has no option but to grant amnesty, hence the use of the word \"shall.\"\n\tHowever, it's the basis of the argument that if any one of those three jurisdictional facts is not satisfied, then in our submission, the Committee does not have the power to grant amnesty.",

            "MR BERGER",
            "Okay, I have no difficulty with both sections being at the core of this particular problem and the proper interpretation of both sections.  Section 19, the section that you refer me to, does use the word \"upon receipt of any application for amnesty\" and then talks about the Committee returning the application to the applicant and giving such directions in respect of the completion and submission of the application.  It doesn't talk about re-submission of the application, the application - when an application is submitted, in our submission it must be a valid application.  Now the use of the word \"any\", my learned friend for the applicants says in his heads of argument that any means any and therefore includes invalid applications as well.  Chairperson, there is a case referred to in my heads at page 5, paragraph 16 - \"Minister of Safety and Security versus Malutsi and another\".  Now whilst it's authority for the proposition that I make in that paragraph, it's also authority for the proposition that \"any\" doesn't necessarily mean \"any\" -the law reports, Chairperson, as you will know, are repleted cases which say that \"shall\" does not always mean \"shall\" , \"and\" doesn't always mean \"and\" and so on, one has to look at it in it's proper context.  Now in the Malutsi case, if I could very briefly state what happened.  Mrs Malutsi instituted action against the Minister of Safety and Security for damages arising out of the death of her husband.  Her husband was shot and killed by a policeman.  Initially it was alleged that that policeman shot and killed the deceased acting within the course and scope of his duties as a policeman.  It became apparent just before trial that perhaps that cause of action wasn't going to be successful and another - well it was argued that it was an extension of the cause of action but the court found it was a new cause of action - was found - which said that it was negligent for the Minister or for the police to have issued this particular policeman with a gun and therefore and that negligence - the policeman had a criminal record - and therefore that negligence led to the death of the deceased.  The reliance was placed - you will recall there was Section 32 of the Police Act that said if you didn't issue a letter in terms of Section 32 out one month before you issued summons, in which you set out the cause of action, you were forever time barred and your cause of action had to be started within six months - your summons had to be issued within six months.  A proclamation had been issued by the Minister of Safety and Security prior to that which repealed Section 32 and included a new provision, Section 17, which said \"any cause of action\" and again used the word any, \"which arose prior to the coming into operation of this proclamation will now be governed by the terms of this proclamation\" and the proclamation gave the courts the discretion to condone non-compliance with Section 32, it was now Section 17, you could institute action within a year but even if you didn't do that, as long as it was in the interests of justice, the court could dispense with the requirements of that section, whereas previously, under the old legislation, the court - once the time bar came down in terms of Section 32, that was the end of it and the courts had no power to condone and it was argued on behalf of Mr Malutsi, that any cause of action meant exactly what it said, \"any cause of action\".  It was found by the Appellate Division, Chief Justice Corbett at the time said the following at page 97 of this judgement, he said \"The proviso which makes Section 17 applicable speaks of all such causes of action\"  This refers back to the opening words of paragraph 1, quote \"any cause of action.\"\n   \"Any\" is an all embracing term and then there's a quote from N.S.J.A. \"In it's natural and ordinary sense, 'any', unless restricted by the context, is an indefinite term which includes all the things to which it relates.\"\n\tChief Justice Corbett continued:  \"The critical question in this case is whether any cause of action in the opening part of paragraph (i) should be given an all inclusive or a restrictive meaning.  Should the term be interpreted to comprehend cases where prior to the commencement of the proclamation the claimant in respect of a cause of action which arose against the police force had not complied with the requirements of Section 32 and as at the commencement of the proclamation time had run out or should it be read to restrict it's provisions to such cases where as at the commencement of the proclamation, time had not yet run out.  For convenience, I shall refer to these respectively as the extensive interpretation and the restricted interpretation\" and the court finally came to the conclusion that any cause of action did not mean \"any cause of action\" it meant any cause of action that was still valid.\n\tI'm sorry, I'm being told that I'm speaking too fast for the interpreters, I'll slow down.\n\tThe sum total of everything that I've said up to this point is that any cause of action in that statute was interpreted in it's context to mean \"any cause of action which was still valid\".",

            "It is correct, if I could address this problem of the Committee, it is correct that the use of the word \"any\" could mean, could be restricted to mean any valid application or it could mean any application however defective.  Because of the argument which I make later, the submission is that it means a valid application because of vested rights which are at play but even if I am wrong on that, even if \"any\" means literally anything, even a scrap piece of paper with a name saying \"I'm applying for Amnesty.\" - even if it includes that and I'm quite happy to argue it on that basis, our submission is that the requirements of Section 18 have not been satisfied.  If \"any\" means \"any\" in it's widest possible sense then an application comes into the Committee, as these applications did, then the Committee can return the application and say \"your application is defective, re-submit\" if the word and submission of the application means re-submission, I'm happy to argue it on that basis as well - re-submit you application.  The Committee did not do that.  The reason why I would venture why the Committee did not do that is because an undertaking was given in the covering letter attached to my learned friends' heads of argument which said that we will provide further details at a later stage and indeed the further details which were provided were in the form of fresh applications which came in February 1998.  So \"any\" application can mean a defective application but then the question remains is - has Section 18 been satisfied?\n\tNow Section 18, Members of the Committee, says \"Any person who wishes to apply for amnesty in respect of any act, omission or offence on the grounds that it is an act associated with a political objective, shall within a certain time period submit such an application to the Commission in the prescribed form.\"  My learned friend argues at page 12 of his heads of argument that the word \"shall\" in Section 18 refers to the time period and not to the prescribed form.  I submit that that is clearly wrong if one de-constructs the wording of Section 18 it is quite clear that the word \"shall\" governs both the time period and the submission of the application because if the word \"shall\" doesn't govern the submission of the application, the section would read \"any person who wishes to apply for amnesty - something - submit an application to the Committee in the prescribed form.\"  That \"shall\" as a matter of English grammar can only be read as governing both the time period as well as the submission of an application, it cannot be read in grammar any other way other than that.\n\tNow, the prescribed form was promulgated, some forms seem to have six pages and some forms seem to have four pages but I would suggest that just depends on the printer that was available at the time, but the contents is identical.  The regulation promulgated in terms of the section makes it clear again in Section 2.1 that it - well it says \"an application for amnesty in terms of Section 18 of the Act \"shall\" be made in the form of form 1 of the annexure.  \n\tOur submission is that the purpose of the form is to solicit information to determine whether prima facie an applicant is entitled for amnesty and there are certain requirements set out in the form.  One is that is must be sworn to or solemnly affirmed before a Commissioner of Oaths, that's at the top of the form and at the bottom of the form there's place for a deponent to sign and a Commissioner of Oaths.  It's suggested by my learned friend in his heads of argument that deponent doesn't mean deponent, anybody can sign on behalf of a deponent but, with respect, that cannot be right when the legislature requires a document to be submitted under oath such as an affidavit.  If there's an affidavit that has to be submitted in certain proceedings, the deponent to the affidavit must be the deponent who has the knowledge contained in that affidavit.  If I want to buy a house and I have to depose to an affidavit, I personally must depose to that affidavit to state that certain facts are true and correct.",

            "Thank you.  One of the people who it was said that \"we are not in a position to contact our clients personally\" was Mr Victor Mthembu.  He's recorded there as number as number 13.  His very application was signed on that very day, the 9th May 1997.  So, as a matter of fact, we know that that is not correct in relation to Mr Victor Mthembu.\n\tThe second point is that Mr Lukhozi, Thomas Lukhozi, had an application form submitted, he's number 14 on this list and we now have a statement from Mr Thomas Lukhozi saying that when he was approached to make an application for amnesty, he refused, he did not want to make an application for amnesty.\n\tFor all seventeen people, the first and fourth pages were identical and I set out in heads of argument exactly what was there, there was just a name and address, an age, a case number, a charge and a statement that no civil proceedings were pending.\n\tThe submission that we make is that it is clear that as at 30th September 1997 which was the cut off date, which was some four months after the applications were faxed through to the TRC offices, applicants 1 - 15 had failed to submit their applications in the prescribed form.\n\tIn the case referred to at paragraph 12 of the heads of argument, Williamson versus Schoon, Judge Nafsa was dealing with the question of whether or not the court had jurisdiction to stay some civil proceedings pending the outcome of Craig Williamson's amnesty application.  19.6 is a sub-section of 19 and 19.6 says \"If the act, omission or offence, which is the subject of an application under Section 18, constitutes the ground of any claim in civil proceedings instituted against the person who submitted that application.  The court\nhearing\" - and then I'll summarise the court hearing that claim - \" may in it's discretion stay the civil proceedings pending the consideration and disposal of the application.\"\n\tThe section specifically talks about someone having submitted an application in terms of Section 18 and Judge Nafsa found that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain a claim for stay of proceedings until such time as a proper application had been made in terms of Section 18 and at page 1071 b - c of the judgement, Judge Nafsa said \"It is important to note that in terms of Section 19.6 and application for amnesty, with the required particularity is required to be lodged before a court is called upon to exercise it's statutory discretion.  No provision is made for a stay of proceedings before an application for amnesty has been made.\"\n\tIf that is so, Chairperson and Members of the Committee, that the court has no jurisdiction to stay proceedings until an application for amnesty has been made or as Section 19.6 expressly says \"the person who submitted that application or above that an application under Section 18 has been made\".  In my submission, that judgement is authority for the proposition that an application is only properly made in terms of Section 18 when it is submitted within the prescribed time period in the prescribed form and contains the particularity required by the prescribed form.  \n\tNow obviously my learned friend pointed out in his heads of argument, the prescribed form says it must be in capital letters and therefore does it mean if it's not in capital letters that that's not proper compliance?\n\tThere's a whole string of cases.  Sometimes the Appellate Division goes one way, sometimes the Appellate Division goes another way but the thrust of the cases is that if compliance is prescribed, if it's preemptory, that means substantial compliance.  Sometimes the cases put it differently, they say well, let's not talk about substantial compliance or exact compliance, let's look at what is requested and how far from what is requested has been furnished.  That's another way in my submission of saying look for the substance, has the substance been complied with.",

You see one of the problems that the nation faced at the time of the promulgation of the statute was that there had been massive gross violation of human rights.  Victims had no idea how and when it occurred, they didn't know the truth.  The primary purpose of the Act is to uncover the truth and in doing so it encourages the perpetrators to come forward so that the victims can learn if the truth is spoken - what happened to their loved ones, the circumstances under which they died.  Should we not find an interpretation that would be consistent with this policy of the Act?

            "No, I'll deal with it now, Chairperson, it seems to of concern.  The granting of amnesty in terms of the Act was a constitutional requirement.  I don't think I need to go into the history of the compromise that was reached at Kempton Park, everybody knows about it.  In the interim constitution, it was recorded that there shall be amnesty and the constitution said \"Amnesty shall be granted\" - let me start at the beginning of the sentence:  \"In order to advance such reconciliation and such reconstruction, amnesty shall be granted in respect of acts, omissions and offences associated with political objectives and committed in the course of the conflicts of the past.  To this end, parliament under this constitution shall adopt a law determining a firm cut off date which shall be a date after 8 October 1990 and before 6 December 1993 and providing for mechanisms, criteria and procedures including tribunals, if any through which such amnesty shall be dealt with at any time after the law has been passed.\"  The constitution said that an act of parliament must provide for procedures and criteria through which amnesty can be granted because amnesty was not going to be granted to any one and everyone, it had to be granted in terms of certain criteria and in terms of certain procedures - that's what the constitution required so it was prior to the start of the work of the TRC, even prior to the Human Rights Violations that the constitution already contained an imperative that there shall be amnesty but subject to procedures and subject to criteria.\nThat there is a trade off between truth and justice was recognised and in fact has been recognised by the Constitutional Court in the AZAPO case, AZAPO versus President of the Republic of South Africa - it's referred to in my heads of argument.  The Deputy President, Justice Mohammed as he then was, said the effect of an amnesty undoubtedly impacts on very fundamental rights.  All persons are entitled to the protection of the law against unlawful invasions of their right to life, their right to respect for and protection of dignity and their right not to be subject to torture of any kind.  When those rights are invaded, those aggrieved by such invasion have the right to obtain redress in the ordinary courts of law and those guilty of perpetrating such violations are answerable before such courts both civilly and criminally and amnesty to the wrongdoer effectively obliterates such rights.  \n\tNow my learned friend says there will be no prejudice to anybody if these defective applications are allowed to stand.  That is not correct.  Meta Molete will not have the right to sue  - Meta Molete, Mrs Pauline Mbatha will not have the right to sue if the applicants are granted amnesty.",

There's an additional process in terms of which even when they are received we're still entitled to ask for further particulars and a whole range of other information gathering and investigative tools, if you like.  So what I'm asking you in essence is this, should we not be drawing a distinction between a number of different things here.  On the one hand the submission of the application, add to that Section 19 which provides a mechanism for giving directions on completion or submission and for further particulars.  After that point you then have an application.  That application is then in and then there's a further opportunity for further investigation and further particulars which is then inherent in the other sections after that.

            "No, no, it's important for me to say this.  The requirement of 20(a) that the application comply with the requirements of the Act, is a completely different requirement from the requirement of full disclosure.  The requirement of full disclosure goes to further particulars and evidence before the Committee - that's what full disclosure is directed at but 20(a) is something different to full disclosure.  It's something different to the particularity that the Committee can request at a later stage.  If I can just go back to the vested rights and then I'll finish off with this.\n\tThe AZAPO case argued or the applicants argued in AZAPO \"you can't deprive us of our rights in the civil courts and the criminal courts by granting amnesty because that would be contrary to Section 22 of the Constitution\" and Justice Mohammed recognised this competition in the passage I've just read and also at page 683 where he said \"Every decent human being must feel grave discomfort in living with a consequence which might allow the perpetrators of evil acts to walk the streets of this land with impunity, protected in their freedom by an amnesty immune from constitutional attack, but the circumstances in support of this course require carefully to be appreciated.\"  \n\tWhat I'm submitting to the Committee is that, yes it's correct that if the applications are allowed in, it doesn't necessarily mean the applicants will get amnesty, that is clear, but if the applications are allowed to proceed then they can only proceed on the basis that they comply with the requirements of the Act and then what is left for the Committee to be satisfied on is (b) and (c), whether the Act associated with a political objective and whether there has been full disclosure and that will relate to the further particulars and to the evidence before the Committee but once the applications are allowed to proceed for example Mr Mthembu's application.  Mr Mthembu's application complies with our requirements of the Act so he has satisfied the one jurisdictional fact already.  Once the other applications come in, they have satisfied the one jurisdictional fact.  Mr Mthembu now has to satisfy full disclosure, those are all his affidavits and what he said before the Committee and the requirement of a political objective.  So there is a real and substantial prejudice which accrues to the victims if the applications are allowed to proceed because then jurisdictional fact (a) has been satisfied and the applicants are one third of the way closer to amnesty.  \n\tIf one accepts that there are vested rights at play here then Sections 18, 19 and 20 must be construed restrictively.  I'm at paragraph 16 of my heads of argument.  The Appellate Division in the Malutsi case said we can interpret 'any' to mean any cause of action which arose but then we must recognise that once the six month bar has fallen in actions against the police under Section 32 of the Act, the police have a vested right not to be sued and you can't take away that vested right unless that is the only possible meaning that you can give to the legislation.  The Appellate Division said, no, we can construe the legislation restrictively so that it doesn't take away vested rights and so we will construe the word 'any' to mean any application that has not yet become time barred.",

        ],
        [
            "MR BERGER",
            "Because, Chairperson, they had the right in terms of Section 18 of the Act to apply for amnesty in the prescribed form.  They had from - well from 1996 they had the right to apply for amnesty but even if one leaves that out of the picture and we know that they were intending to apply for amnesty because the judge says so in his judgement, he says \"I'm told you're intending to apply for amnesty.\"  We don't know which of them were intending to apply, all of them or some of them but at least that was mentioned, so in 1994 the question of amnesty was considered.  The form was promulgated in 1996, people were in jail, people were in contact with their lawyers.  In 1997 in May applications were put in, the lawyers knew that there was a problem and the applicants dilly dallied from May until January and it was only after a letter from the TRC in November of that year saying we still don't have any information from you that the fresh applications were re-submitted.  So, yes, the applicants had the right to apply for amnesty but it's their own delay which has put them in the position which they are in today.  Mr Mthembu applied timeously, he exercised his right and by doing so he infringed upon the rights of the victims.  Well, he had that right and he did it and the law allows it but the law also says if are vested rights and just like the police acquired a vested right when the Section 32 letter was not served timeously, so the victims acquire a vested right - I now have the right to sue civilly because you, Mr Applicant, have not complied with the provisions of the Act, you are late and you are now not entitled to be immune from civil and criminal litigation.\n\tAt page 98 of the Malutsi judgement, Chief Justice Corbett said at (h) \"Having given the matter anxious consideration\" in other words weighing up the respective rights, competing rights, \"I have come to the conclusion that there is insufficient indication of a legislative intent to warrant interference with a vested right of the Defendant, Police Force, in his favour the expiry term provided by Section 32 has run it's course.  I therefore opt for the restricted interpretation of Section 12.2 (i) of the proclamation.\" \n\tIt follows that the appeal must succeed.  Our submission is that there is insufficient indication in the statute to  warrant an extensive interpretation and the reason that we say that is because we must go back to Section 18 which says that you shall submit an application in the prescribed form and it's coupled to a time period, that shall governs both and they are linked.  If one takes out - if one reads it - shall within twelve months, if one reads that as the prescribe period, submit such an application to the Commission in the prescribed form.  If one looks at the way that sentence has been constructed, the two commas are inserted to provide for an extended period and extended prescribed period but if that extended prescribed period was not there - let's say that the Act had from the beginning set the 30th September as the cut off point, the legislation would read that any person shall on or before 30 September 1997 submit such an application to the Commission in the prescribed form - it's an imperative and then there's Section 21 (a) as well as Section 3 (i) (b) which says that the requirements of the Act are a requirement for amnesty.  The question which is raised is then why, why is that there.  One then has to look at Section 19 and the purpose of having an application under oath in the prescribed form is to enable the Committee to then conduct it's investigations with evidence now before the Committee.  The Committee could even grant amnesty on the basis of certain applications without hearing oral evidence because there's written evidence and certain investigations can be undertaken.\n\tThere's a case that, that I wish to refer to, which is not in my heads of argument.  It's the case of S. Bothma, B-o-t-h-m-a and Son Transport (Pty) Ltd. versus the President of the Industrial Court and others, 1988/3SA/319 Transvaal.  The judgement of Judge Myburgh, the Judge Myburgh who is the present President of the Labour Appeal Court.  It was a labour case, it dealt with an application for interim relief in terms of Section 43.4 of the old Labour Relations Act.  Section 43 (ii) of that Act said that any party to dispute who applies under Section 35 for the establishment of a conciliation board in respect of a dispute may, the use of the word there was \"may\", at the same time or within seven days apply, here it was to the Minister but it came to the Industrial Court for an order in terms of 43.4.  The regulations there for Conciliation Boards that there was a prescribed form and it had to be submitted and the dates had to be clear and that form had to be signed.  Reference was made in that case or by counsel for the applicant to the Maharaj decision, the precise passage that my learned friend relies upon in his heads of argument, but the facts of the case were very simply that the application for the Conciliation Board was made on the 3rd September - I beg your pardon - was made on the 4th September and the application for relief in terms of Section 43 was made on the 3rd September, in other words, one day before instead of at the same time or within seven days.  Counsel for the applicant argued that well within seven days could mean within seven days either way and the court said no, it can't, even though there's just one day difference, the legislator has said you do the one and then if you want to do the other, it comes afterwards.  That was how the \"may\" was interpreted and the application was struck out because it did not comply with the provisions of Section 43 and the reason for that was you have to apply for a Conciliation Board first, you have to get the conciliatory machinery in progress and once you do that you can then apply to the Industrial Court for relief and even though, in that particular case, there was only one days difference, the court said no, you've done it incorrectly and the legislature then implied the - the sanction of the legislature is if you don't do it properly, you forfeit your relief in terms of Section 43 (iv) of the Act.",

            "Mr Lax and the Committee, 19.3 (a) 2 is not properly construed the Committee's request for further particulars.  The Committee's request for further particulars is indeed in terms of Section 19 (i) and I'll explain why.  My learned friend, Mr Brink, with respect is not correct because 19.2 says once you've got the application then the Committee can make certain enquiries then 3 says \"After such an investigation, the Committee may inform the applicant that the application judged on the particulars or further particulars contained in the applications, or provided by the applicant or revealed as a result of enquiries made by the Committee, if any, does not relate to an Act associated with a political objective.  So the Committee then writes back to the applicant and says \"Your application, together with the further particulars which you have supplied to us, does not reveal an act associated with a political objective.\"  Then the applicant is afforded a further opportunity to make a further submission as to why the act should be regarded as an act associated with a political objective and then, and 3 - then the Committee decides whether the application, judged on the particulars referred to in sub-paragraph 1, that's the application plus the further particulars, and in such further submission relates to an act associated with a political objective and if it is satisfied that the application does not relate to such an act in the absence of the applicant and without holding a hearing refused the application and informed the applicant accordingly.  So it's, with respect not, not the further particulars, it's the Committee forming a view which was not done in this case as far as I know, that the applications as submitted do not disclose acts associated with a political objective and then say \"you've now got one further opportunity to convince us that it is an act associated with a political objective\" and that's why it's so important that the original application be under oath and be substantially complete to the extent that the applicant must say \"these are the acts for which I seek amnesty - this is what I did\" and the applicants don't do that and they definitely don't do it under oath, all they do is give a case number.  If one managed to relate that back to the Boipatong criminal trial because no court was given at that state, but even if one says alright they were referring to the Boipatong trial, they are asked in that document \"which charges were you convicted of?\" - \"details to follow\" and if one reads the 3000 pages of the Boipatong record, there's a complete denial.  So, at this stage, one doesn't know what act the applicants are applying for amnesty for.  Beyond that, one doesn't know what the political objective is because if one reads the Boipatong criminal trial there is no mention at all because of the denial, there is no mention of a political objective.  So the very basic fundamentals of an Amnesty Application are missing and that's why we submit that there hasn't been any compliance, not even substantial compliance and we set out in paragraphs 13.1 through to 13.6 what we submit are the fundamental particulars which ought to be in an amnesty application.  It's correct that, that then shuts the door on the applicants but this is a situation entirely of the applicants own making.  If you will just bear with me for a moment.\n\tChairperson and Members of the Committee, I have tried to deal with as many points as possible which might come up in the argument of my learned friend but at this point I'll rest and save the rest for reply.",

After listening to my learned friend's argument, there's no real dispute as far as these facts are concerned so I'm not going to repeat them.  I would like to start my argument on page 8 of my heads of argument, but before I deal with that, my learned friend made the submission that the applications that were filed during February 1998 were fresh applications.  Now I cannot agree with submission.  The fact of the matter, applications were made before the original cut off date being the 10th May 1997 and Amnesty numbers were given to these applications so he is not correct.  The fact that they were not complete does not mean they weren't applications.  They were applications and therefore what followed thereafter was actually further particulars, more detailed applications and although the standard form or the Form 1 was used when further details were given, that does not mean that what was provided was a fresh application.  The point I'm making is that there were applications before the TRC at that stage already.\n\tMr Chairman, in my heads of argument, I firstly argue on the basis of Section 18 standing on it's own and what I'm saying is that if one looks at Section 18, there is a reference to \"shall\".  Now immediately there's a reference in an Act to the word \"shall\" the initial idea is that that is a preemptory reference.  My submission is that, not in all cases, where the word \"shall' is being used can it be argued that it's preemptory, my submission is that in fact in this instance, that word \"shall\" refers more to the time period and the cut off date and I would submit that the cut off date and the time period is definitely preemptory to the extent that even substantial compliance would not be sufficient.  So an application should be launched before the cut off date but on interpretation I would submit that the second portion, although the word \"shall\" may have reference to submit such an application to the Commission in the prescribed form, that that is merely a directory and not preemptory and ....[intervention]",

Only thereafter, if it's unclear, then one will have to look at the intention of the legislature.

With respect, that is not correct, if one has a look at the definition of prescribed in the Act it says prescribed means prescribed by regulation under Section 40 and if one then turns to Section 40, it's the President, the President may make regulations prescribing anything required to be prescribed for the proper application of this Act.  The power is given to the President to prescribe the form and whatever form the President prescribes is given the power of statute and that is the form that has to be completed, that Section 18 says \"you shall submit an application in the prescribed form and whatever conditions are contained in that prescribed form, you shall comply with.\"  That's what the regulations are there for, gives the President the power to legislate.  Delegated legislation I might add.\n\tMy learned friend said that if there was - if there's no substantial compliance for the cut off date then the applications are not good enough and I agree with my learned friend on that, that is quite correct.  If there is no substantial compliance before the cut off date then the applications are defective and therefore invalid, that is quite correct.",

            "MR BERGER",
            "And we know that the TRC did not call upon the applicants to remedy the defects until after they had submitted fresh applications - in fact we know that the TRC never called upon the applicants to remedy the defect.  So as at 30 September 1997, the defects had not been remedied, that much is common cause, so therefore it must follow, on my learned friends argument, that as at 30 September 1997 those applications were invalid.\n\tMy learned friend says that a letter from prison is an application within the meaning of the Act.  That, with respect, cannot possibly be correct because if that is so then one must ignore the provisions of Section 18 with regard to the prescribed form.\n\tMy learned friend said that Section 19 (i) saves the day for the applicant.  I am prepared to accept for the purposes of this argument that any application includes the applications that were defective.  Section 19 (i) says that the Committee may return the application to the applicant and give such directions in respect of the completion and submission of the application.  Clearly, the clear meaning of those words is - you haven't completed your application properly, we are returning your application to you so that you can complete it properly and then submit it in terms of Section 19 (i) and submission of the application.  That submission and the submission in Section 18 must be in the prescribed form or request the applicant to provide such further particulars.  So Section 19 (i) also makes provision for further particulars but that is something after a valid application has been submitted.  If a valid application is not submitted, it gets returned to the applicant so that he can resubmit it.  It was pointed out to the applicants that their applications were defective - in fact it didn't even have to be pointed out to the applicants that their applications were defective, they knew it and that's why they said details to follow at a later stage and when they submitted the further details, it was done in the form of a fresh application.  Section 19 (i) in fact is totally against the applicants, on a proper reading of Section 19 (i) it doesn't save the day at all, in fact I would submit that the returning of the application to the applicant can mean only one thing, that the application is defective and it doesn't become a proper application until it is resubmitted in accordance with the requirements of Section 18 and to say that Section 19 (i) - the requirements of Section 19 (i) have been complied with and therefore Section 21 (a) has been satisfied, is with respect, losing sight of Section 18.  Section 18 is also a requirement of the Act - it too must be complied with.  Nothing was done in respect of the defective applications until after the cut off date, therefore at that date there were no proper applications before the Committee.  Whether or not the Committee accepted the applications, there would be argument about waiver.  With respect, whether or not the application is valid is a decision which must be taken by the Committee not by Advocate Mpshe, it's the Committee now who takes the decision whether or not the applications are valid.\n\tThe fact that Section 19 doesn't expressly refer to Section 18 doesn't really take the matter any further.  Section 18 says you must submit an application in the prescribed form, Section 19 then talks about applications which have been submitted.  \n\tIf the ordinary grammatical meaning is given to the word \"any\" then the ordinary grammatical meaning can likewise be given to the word \"shall\".\n\tSection 19 was designed to remedy defective applications, I'll accept that but then they must be remedied before 30 September 1997.  If they are not remedied they remain defective and as at the cut off date invalid.",

The question is whether vested rights are being taken away.  The applicants had their rights and they had the power to preserve their rights.  Their own actions meant that they forfeit those rights.  The victims have not had the power to preserve their rights, they rely on the provisions of the Act.  Mr Khubeka's application can be supplemented now and he will then have a valid application before the Committee.  With respect, that highlights the absurdity of the argument of saying that the applications can be - the defectiveness can be cured at any stage.  The defectiveness cannot be cured at any stage - there must be valid applications as at per cut off date otherwise Mr Khubeka could come in ten years time and say I want to now give you my story and the Committee would be bound to hear him.  That can't possibly be correct.\n\tAnd finally, as far as the purpose and spirit of the Act is concerned, yes, the purpose of the Act is to get at the truth but the purpose of the Act is also to set limits so that there can be justice between the parties.  The applicants had their rights, they forfeited them, the victims have their rights and they stand on those rights.  We would ask that the applications be dismissed for want of compliance of Section 21 (a).  Thank you.",

            "On the 10th May 1997, the attorneys who were acting for the remaining fifteen applicants submitted applications on behalf of the remaining applicants.  These applications were neither signed by the applicants nor attested to by the Commissioner of Oaths.  Each application was accompanied by a covering letter in which it was stated inter alia that the applications are incomplete, that the applications relate to the charges in connection with the Boipatong Massacre and that the outstanding information would be furnished in due course.  The reason for the incomplete nature of the application and the fact that they were not signed by the applicants was given as being that the attorneys had been unable to get hold of the applicants prior to the deadline for the submission of the applications for amnesty which at that stage stood at the 10th May 1997.  The covering letter also referred to a conversation which the writer of that letter had with Advocate Mpshe in regard to what was to become of the applications.  Although initially the first and the last pages of the applications were submitted by telefax transmission, the entire applications were subsequently sent by registered post.  These applications were received by the TRC prior to the 30th September 1997.  These applications were duly registered by the Amnesty Committee and were allocated numbers in accordance with the internal procedures of the Amnesty Committee.  On about the 14th July 1997 a possible setting down of these cases was discussed and this was followed up by a letter of the 15th July 1997 by the Attorneys who were then acting for these applicants.  In a letter of the 10th November 1997, the Executive Secretary of the Amnesty Committee reminded the applicants of their earlier undertaking to furnish the outstanding information.  At the same time he advised the applicants that their applications had been identified as matters that were to be dealt with at a hearing and also pointed out that failure by the applicants to furnish the outstanding information was presenting difficulties to the Amnesty Committee in terms of processing these applications.  Eventually the present attorneys for the applicants submitted the outstanding information on or about the 13th February 1998.  This took the form of properly completed Form 1 duly attested before Commissioners of Oaths.  No such further applications though were submitted on behalf of Khubeka and Mbatha.  It is common cause that these further applications by the applicants were received well after the extended deadline of the 30th September 1997.\n\t The question before this Committee is whether the applications by the fifteen applicants comply with the requirements of the Act.  The matter is governed by Section 18 (i) read with Section 19 (i) of the promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act No. 34 of 1995 as amended.  Now Section 18 (i) provides \"any person who wishes to apply for amnesty in respect of any act or omission or offence on grounds that it is an act associated with a political objective shall within twelve months from the date of the proclamation referred to in Section 7 (iii) or such extended period as may be prescribed, submit such an application to the Commission in the prescribed form.\"  The prescribed form referred to in Section 18, sub-section 1 was published in Government Gazette No. 16985 dated 9 February 1996 and it is referred to as Form 1.  Form 1 requires inter alia that it must be completed in block letters, sworn to solemnly, affirmed before a Commissioner of Oaths and thereafter returned to the Amnesty Committee.  It is common cause that at least by the 30th September 1997 applications on Form 1 had been submitted on behalf of the applicants.  These applications were incomplete and had not been signed by the applicants themselves and had not been attested to before the Commissioner of Oaths.  \n\tThe issue of substance is whether the applications which are now before this Committee complies with the requirements of the Act and this in turn depends upon the proper construction of Section 19, sub-section 1 of the Act.  Now Section 19 (i) of the Act provides \"upon receipt of any application for amnesty, the Committee may return the application to the applicant and give such directions in respect of the completion and submission of the application as may be necessary or request that the applicant to provide such further particulars as it may deem necessary.\n\tSection 19 (i) appears to contemplate that the Amnesty Committee would receive not only incomplete applications for amnesty or improperly completed applications but applications which are not made on the prescribed form 1 or for that matter applications which may not have been signed by the applicants themselves.\n\tThe use of the word \"any\" and the provisions suggest that it refers to any application whatsoever.  What the Act did was to empower and authorise the Amnesty Committee to call upon the applicant who has furnished a defective application to rectify that defect.  We believe that the interpretation we are placing on Section 19 (i) is consistent with the policy of the Act.  It must be remembered that one of the objectives of the Act is to uncover the gross human rights violations of the past.  It seeks to help the survivors and the dependants of the tortured and the wounded, the maimed and the dead to discover what did in truth happen to their loved ones where and under what circumstances it happened and who was responsible.  That truth which the victims so desperately seek is more likely to be forthcoming if the perpetrators of these gross human rights violations are encouraged to come forward and tell and disclose the whole truth upon the promise that if they do so, they will not be prosecuted.  In dealing with these applications, that is what we have to bear in mind.  In our view the Amnesty Committee was entitled upon receiving the applications by the applicants to call upon the applicants to remedy the defects in their initial applications by submitting the outstanding information which the applicants subsequently did by filing further applications which were properly completed and duly attested.  The initial applications must be read together with the subsequent applications which the applicants submitted as supplemented by the further particulars and the further affidavits which the applicants submitted.\n\tIn the result, the Committee is satisfied that the application by Qambelani Buthelezi, Bhekinkosi Mkhize, Tebogo Magubane, Vincent Khanyile, Timothy Stals Mazibuko, Jack Mbele, Sonny Michael Mkwanazi, Moses Mthembu, Mplupeki Tshabangu, Sipho Buthelezi, Petrus Mdiniso, Mxoliseni Sibongeleni Mkhize and Richard Dlamini comply with the requirements of the Act.\n\tIn so far as the application by Mbatha is concerned, the applicant Mbatha is not before this Committee and therefore his application cannot be dealt with at these proceedings therefore his application is removed from the roll.\n\tIn regard to the application which was not before us but which we are told was made by Mr Khubeka, that application - there appears to be further investigations which are to be conducted in regard to that application and therefore it cannot be dealt with presently.\n\tMr Strydom, the application by Mr Khubeka was never enrolled was it?",
