<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just remain Mr Mahlangu, don't sit down, just stand.  Give your full names for the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Johannes Mabulani Mahlangu.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  You can sit down.  Mr Richard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Mahlangu, during the period December 1990, January 1991, were you a member of or a supporter of any political party or political movement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes, I was a member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You say a member, did you carry a membership card of any party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> I had a card.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Issued by who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> The ANC Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When did you join the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> I think it was in 1987 or 1988.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I believe that would be 1987, is that correct, 1987?  Now did you ever occupy any particular portfolio or position within the Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So you were just an ordinary member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, where did you grow up and where were you schooled?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Pieterskraal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  In Pieterskraal, did you get to know the Mtsweni family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What political affiliation did they have, if any?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> I am not quite certain about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, how did you demonstrate your membership or support of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> I used to participate in boycotts and also I used to volunteer as a member to help if there were meetings, I used to participate as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  Now, at what stage did you become aware of the discussions regarding Emma Mtsweni and her connection with witchcraft?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> I heard about this in the last meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> In the last meeting?  When you say the last meeting, on what time of the day, on which day, was this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> It was at about six in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Where was this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Egukhanyeni School.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When you arrived at that meeting, what had your learnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> When I arrived, the meeting was just about to be finished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you know what the meeting was about and what did you learn about what had happened in the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Lately yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I didn't understand, sorry?  You arrived at the meeting, the meeting was about to disperse, did you ask anyone what was happening at the meeting and why the meeting had been held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What were you told?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> I was told that Emma Mtsweni was supposed to accompany others to go to a sangoma and the meeting area was going to be the school, and therefore it was decided that she was going to be fetched in order to be questioned why she didn't show up in the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you know why she was supposed to show up at the meeting and what was supposed to be investigated after this discussion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And you confirm what the previous witnesses have said today, about why she had to be fetched?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, what did you do, did you go with them to go and fetch her or did you stay at Pieterskraal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> I went with them to fetch her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Where did you go to fetch her from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> We went to fetch her from Vaalbank, where she had fled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> At Vaalbank, how did you go to Vaalbank, did you walk, did you ride?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, or did you listen to the full account that was given of this trip and how the deceased was picked up in Vaalbank, and everything that happened on the way and how she was eventually taken back to the school where that meeting was being held.  Do you confirm that testimony or do you differ from it?  If you differ from it, just tell us in</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>which respects you differ.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> I do confirm everything they had said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Good.  You are now back at the school, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> For how long were you back at the school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> We only spent about four to five minutes there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And then where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> We went to the mountain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You have heard the previous evidence of going to the mountain, do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes, I do confirm what they have said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, where were you in relation to the deceased when you arrived at the mountain and did you see anything being done to her or happening to her?  Did people question her, do anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> I was responsible for taking her out of the car and then after that, I left her in the hands of comrades and I didn't do anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry, how did you take her out of the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> I opened the door and she was taken out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What did the comrades do with her once they took her out of the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> They surrounded her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What did they say or do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> It was, they were toyi-toying and singing and after they surrounded her, they started singing louder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you hear what they were singing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What were they singing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> They were singing (indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And you agree with the interpretation the previous witnesses have given us of that song and what it means?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes, I do agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Could you hear them say anything else to her because if they were singing and - did they say anything else to her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> No, I didn't hear because they were singing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, did you see any ANC leaders around her or near you or any were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes, they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Who did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Victor Ntuli, he was together with us, we left with him and came back with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Scwadi was also present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Anyone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> The only two that I am certain of, the two that I have seen with my eyes, are these two that I have mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was it light or dark in the mountain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> It was dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was it dark so that you could see nothing or dark so that you could see a little bit, full moon light?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> It was dark, but one could see someone close to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> If you knew that person, was it sufficiently light to be able to recognise the people you knew?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> If you knew someone and if he or she was next to you, you will tell who it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, what happened next?  You are at the mountain, people had surrounded her and singing and toyi-toying, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> After they had taken her and surrounded her, I couldn't see properly what was happening to her, but what I saw was Police vans and at that time, she was on fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> When the Police were approaching the mountain, everyone started running away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What happened to Emma Mtsweni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> I wouldn't be able to say what happened to Emma Mtsweni because all I know is that she was on fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  Now, at page 18 of the bundle, which is your application for amnesty, at paragraph 10(a) you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>"... the murder was committed under the leadership of the Youth",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>	why do you say the murder was committed under the leadership of the Youth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Would you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> At paragraph 10(a) of your application for amnesty, there is a section which says "State the political objective that was intended to be achieved", your answer starts by saying and I quote</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>"... the murder was committed under the leadership of the Youth",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>	and then it goes on.  My question is what and how was the murder committed under the leadership of the Youth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> When it was first reported that Emma Mtsweni  was a witch, it came to be known to the comrades.  That is why I am saying it happened under the instructions of the Youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When somebody was reported to the Youth League of the ANC in your area to be a witch, what did the ANC Youth League believe should be done with that person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> We as a Youth were responsible to resolve those problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> In what way did a witch pose a problem to the ANC, how did she threaten the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> We Youth or the ANC Youth, realising that bewitching and killing our parents was going to lead to us being orphans and therefore we couldn't continue development and some of us were going to be orphans and street kids and the organisation was not going to prosper and it was going to be divided.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And then at the same paragraph of your application, after the phrase that I have read you say under the leadership of the Youth, and then I continue</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>"... to help the community by they were not under by any organisation, but the government was the main source of that murder."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>	Would you like to read what I have just read out?  Read it carefully because my question is what do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Read it with 10(b), let him read 10(b) too, the last few lines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> The Chairperson requests that you read 10(a) and 10(b).</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you read it?  Did you write it out yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All right, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Do you confirm what you said there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes, I do agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> The other thing that I was going to ask you is you have heard what other witnesses have said about what the ANC Youth should do with moloi's, do you associate yourself with that comment or do you differ in any way from those comments?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes, I do confirm that and I do agree with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So you agree with the statement that moloi's were seen as opponents of the liberation struggle and people that should be killed for the same reasons as an impimpi should be dealt with in that way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now again a general question.  You have heard the evidence of previous witnesses, both today and yesterday about what a moloi and a ngaka is and the differences between them.  Do you agree with what was said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes, I do agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Do you believe in witchcraft?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you agree with the killing of Emma Mtsweni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And how did you think her killing would further the interests of the struggle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> I knew that the Youth was getting most of their support from their parents and since we were involved in a struggle, it couldn't have been easier for us to do so without parents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  Now, I turn to page 19 of the bundle, paragraph 11(2) and I ask you to read through 11(2)(a).  Thank you.  There you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>"... no order was given, but just because the community was helpless, we the Youth decided to eradicate anything in the way of our community."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>	Did you hear anyone give an order or didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> I didn't hear anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> How did the Youth come to a decision to eradicate witches or particularly Mrs Emma Mtsweni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Here you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>"... we the Youth decided to eradicate anything in the way of our community."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>	I am asking the following questions - what decision was made, where it was made, who made it and how it was communicated to the rest of the world?  Let's start with what was the decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> The decision which was taken was that we should remove anyone who becomes an obstacle in the struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was that decision made on the 2nd of January 1991 or at some time before or after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> It was our policy, or let me say we believed long before that that witches and informers were supposed to be removed.  This was our policy, we comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, to whom was that decision communicated?  Who did you tell about your decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> I think everyone at that time, more especially every Youth knew that a moloi or a witch was someone to be burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now my last question, it was for that reason that once you have heard that Emma Mtsweni was a witch, you decided that she should be killed or the Youth around you decided that she should be killed?  Am I not correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You say you joined the ANC Youth League in 1987 or 1988, did I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Was there a branch of the Youth League at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> No, we didn't have a branch, but we had a branch nearby.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But political organisations were unbanned only during 1990, how would there have been some structures of the ANC in your area in 1987 or 1988?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Would you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Political organisations were unbanned during February 1990, how could it have been, how is it possible that there was a structure of the ANC in your area by the year you said you joined the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> What I know is that I have been a supporter of the ANC since the time of the Mbokodo.  Even though the ANC was banned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Are you not perhaps referring to the United Democratic Front, the UDF which was active during that time when the ANC was banned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes, I am talking about the UDF.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> No further questions Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you, just one.  Did you believe that people who were witches, identified themselves or sympathised with any political formation such as the Nationalist Party government that was in power at the time, or any political grouping?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Can you explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAHLANGU:</span> The reason I am saying that you can refer to them as informers, because in fact they were in a way similar to informers, therefore you can say they were supporting the NP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you know the political affiliation of Emma Mtsweni, if she had any?</p>
