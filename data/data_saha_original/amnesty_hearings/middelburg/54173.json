            "Good afternoon.  We want to start the proceedings.  For the record, it's Wednesday the 10th of May 2000, it is the continuation of the sitting of the Amnesty Committee at Middelburg.  The Panel is constituted as would be apparent from the record.  We just wish to indicate that the proceedings are starting late today, due to a number of logistical and other difficulties that have largely been occasioned by the fact that all of the applicants in all of the applications that are on our roll for today, are in custody in different centres and they had to be transported from these centres to Middelburg, where we are sitting, which is the most central point for the matters that are on the roll for this particular session in Middelburg.\n\tThe situation has been exacerbated by the fact that at some of the centres, Correctional Services has not had its normal staff component, resulting in pressure on the diminished resources that were available, and that affected us and delayed the proceedings here because some of the applicants had to be transported over considerable distances to the venue.  We apologise for the delay in being able to start.  We do intend to, if it's at all possible, finalise the matters that are on the roll for today and if needs be, for that purpose we will consider continuing the session till beyond the normal sitting hours, in order to be able to do so.\n\tThe matters that are to be heard now are the applications of D L Phasha, amnesty reference AM1319/96, L L Phasha, reference AM1318/96 and M M Phasha, reference AM1221/96.  \n\tI'm going to allow the legal representatives to put themselves on record.
