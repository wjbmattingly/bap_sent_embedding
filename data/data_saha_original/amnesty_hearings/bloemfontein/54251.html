<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Can you tell the Committee how far have you gone at school?</p>

<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now can you tell the Committee when did you join PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> I joined PAC in 1989, the 19th of April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Right here in Bloemfontein at Pelindaba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Who recruited you into PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> My brother recruited me into PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Who is your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Titus Lebea, the first applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now were you at any stage a member of APLA - Task Force of APLA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> I later joined the Task Force of APLA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> It was on the 27th of August 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Who recruited you in the Task Force of APLA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> My brother did so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now did you undergo any training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir, but it was a short training that lasted only a day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Where was that and when was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> It was at Pelindaba in Bloemfontein on the 15th of January 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now you have heard the testimony of your brother that it was a week after the 15th that you undergo training, which the Member of the Committee, the Chairperson of the Committee estimated to be around 22nd somewhere of January.  Now you are telling the Committee that on the 15th of January you undergo training.  Can you explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, I think my brother may have forgotten some days, it seems he has been twisting the days there so instead of talking about what happened before, he brought it later in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now, who trained you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Who trained me is the person whom I later knew as Temba Ncapai.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now what name did you know him about before you knew him as Temba Ncapai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> I used to say his name is Sabata.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now let's come to the incident itself.  Can you tell the Committee about the role you played in this whole incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Actually the role I played in this incident, I was a gunman and I was tasked to shoot if ever it's necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Yes, continue.  What did you actually do yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Actually on the event of the incident I was standing outside and after hearing noise inside which I didn't know what was the cause of the noise.  I entered the room through a broken window and what I saw inside there, I saw the victim, Mr van Tonder, was being attacked by the Task Force members and the wife of Mr van Tonder was standing aside trying to stop what was happening there, but unfortunately she couldn't put her hands in there and then because of the noise that was going on, the noise from Mr van Tonder and his wife who was trying to save her husband's life.  I shouted for this guy to stop because the noise was going too far and I decided to shout at them, so that they can stop what they were doing because it was not in the right manner, because it was causing noise, it might invite some uninvited guests.  So they stopped after realising what I was trying to do to them and then because Mr van Tonder was having a shotgun which I didn't know the name thereof, by the time I ordered them to stop, they turned around, Mr van Tonder was having a gun in his hand and he fired a shot which I didn't know whom he hit and these guy they all go out running from the sound of that gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a> 	Then what happened there, Mr van Tonder pointed the firearm at me and he shot me in my right thigh and thereafter, because I was having a gun myself, I started chasing him in the house and Mrs van Tonder tried to close the sliding door and she was in front and Mr van Tonder was behind and I decided to shoot her because she was on my way, I was short, so I had to do what I wanted to do by that time, which was returning the fire to someone who shot me.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>	After that incident, I went out to look what was happening to these other three guys.  I came to find my brother lying on the ground.  Clearly he was shot and I testified he was shot at the back, so I took him to the room behind me, the back room which was said to be a rondavel and then I put him there and he lied there.  I never knew what to do after that because I never experienced such a thing like that where somebody has been shot, especially in the back where the bullet was in the stomach. I never knew what to do.  I ended up taking these other three guys and we went back, breaking the kitchen door, forcefully breaking it, opening it, entering the kitchen and I wanted something to help my brother.  I never thought what could it be, but I wanted something.  I opened the fridge.  I didn't know what to do.  I thought maybe ice can help, but I never thought it would.  At last I end up entering the house in the passage and I said to myself, anybody trying to stop me I'm going to shoot him or her, whoever it can be.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>	Unfortunately I never saw anyone until I entered the room. In that room it was a bedroom of Mr van Tonder and Mrs van Tonder.  What I did in there, the other guys were, by the time I entered, other guys entered the room too, so they were searching for what they were searching for, which was to be done there, but what I did, I opened the wardrobe, clothes wardrobe, because I was looking for one thing, a key to the car, so that I can rescue the life of the person who was shot.  I opened the wardrobe.  Luckily, I don't know maybe the spiritual God was there to guide me for what I was doing there, I raised my hand and reached right on top of the wardrobe.  My hand fell right on top of the car keys and I took the car keys and I got out and the other guy by the name of Mokweti, Samuel, he showed me the safe which was in the corner.  He said the safe is there and the gun is there and I said to him:  "Leave those behind, because someone is injured, or you can take them yourself" and I go out of the door, went to the garage.  	Instead of opening the car first, I broke the car window with my fist and opened the car, entered and started the car and going to fetch my brother at the back of the rondavel, putting him back in the car and Abram Smith decided he will drive because I didn't know how to drive a car and we drove off from the scene there.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>	We went straight to ...(indistinct) hospital.  Unfortunately Thaba N'chu was too far and we never knew how far could he make until the hospital so instead we decided to put him in ...(indistinct) hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>	When we arrived there we took him to the reception where they wanted R20.  Luckily for him, those goods which were taken by those other guys, there was money.  I went back to the car and I took R20 to pay for him at the hospital and they admitted him.  I was shot too, but I was still walking right, I was only full of blood.  I went back to the car and then we went back home.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>	When we arrived home, I felt I was too weak and I was feeling like some kind of dizziness, so I decided that I have to go and see a doctor, so I told these other two guys that I have to go and see a doctor and then I don't know where everything can be stored, so I took there, I don't know whether it was a jewel box, because it was mixed, there was money and all those stuff inside, I took it and I put it in a safe place and I told them to look for the safe place for the car until such time that ...(indistinct) and I went to the private doctor who told me that I was too weak, I need to be put on the water, something like that and the right place for that is hospital, so I went to hospital.  I was admitted at the hospital that same day and put on those drips, water drips, I don't know what kind of water is that.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>	The following day I felt better and insisted on the doctor that I'm feeling better so I have to go because I knew I have to go and do something about what has happened.  So the doctor told me to wait until later.  Later to find out I was taken out on the stretcher, taken to the other wards where it was under - guarded by the police.  I was put in that ward and on my arrival I was chained on my legs and when I asked what was the cause, they said that I'm a suspect, so I slept there for about two days.  After two days the cops came there to fetch me to go and answer me some questions and after that I was referred to the custody.  That is how I went so far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now, Mr Lebea, you heard your brother testifying that he told the Committee yesterday that he gave you instructions before he was taken to hospital what you should do with the goods that were taken and now you are telling the Committee something different to what your brother told the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, I heard what my brother said.  What has happened is that maybe my brother, okay he did said something that he said but because of the something like the collapse that had happened there, I never listened anymore to what he was saying because I was concerned about one thing, the life that was to be lost by that day, so unfortunately because I was shot too, I would never have managed to do whatever it can be done, I did up to so far by holding some other items and then instructing the other guys to go and hide other things somewhere where they can because I was concentrated on my pain on my leg and the dizziness I was suffering.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Let me take you step by step.  He told the Committee that on your arrival there, you put an AK47 in the vehicle which was there, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, he told the Committee that he put the AK47 in the vehicle, but the AK47 was not in the vehicle by that time, it was near the vehicle because the vehicle was locked, so he might be mistaken there.  Maybe he doesn't remember well and as far as I'm concerned, according to my knowledge, he's no more good in memories, he sometimes loses memories and sometimes when you ask him questions, it turns that he never heard it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now are you telling the Committee that what your brother told the Committee, that is the first applicant, is not actually the way things happened on the day in question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Somewhere he's still right, somewhere he's still missing some aspects there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> So are you sure that what you are telling the Committee is exactly what happened that after he was shot and you were also shot your took him to the rondavel and you came back to the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> When you saw him hacking, attacking Mr van Tonder, you shouted for them to stop and at that time Mr van Tonder was still in possession of the gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> It was after they have moved away from him that Mr van Tonder shot at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> He fired a shot, by the time they were turning, looking at me he fired a shot.  I don't know whether that is the shot that caught my brother and they ran out for cover and then Mr van Tonder pointed the gun to me and I was standing looking at him.  I never even had any fear whether he will shoot me or what, I was looking at him and he fired a shot that caught me on the left - my right thigh, if I'm not mistaken, so it's the time then I decided that I should shoot him too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> Just tell us were there any electrical lights on in the house ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> Were there any lights on in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> So you could clearly see what's happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> There was no darkness in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> There was no darkness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> Was Mr van Tonder bleeding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, he was bleeding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> From where?  From which part of his body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> From the head he was bleeding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now can you - now there was also - he was asked about the rondavel and he said - was this rondavel in the farm or somewhere outside the farm, or was still within the premises of Mr van Tonder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> In the premises of Mr van Tonder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Was your brother, according to your observations, still conscious at that time when you took him there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> No he was unconscious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now there was a mention that you were five in this operation, this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> What I knew is that we were four, I never knew the fifth man.  The fifth man I started to know was at the law court which was by the name of Mr Paulus Masitsa, I never knew him before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> Perhaps then we could deal with that immediately because you've made an affidavit, you remember, before going to court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> In your affidavit you stated</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>"The five of us went to a farm close to Mazelspoort with the purpose to break in."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>It's page 41 and then you say:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>"Paulus was outside of the house, he was not inside"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>and this fifth person that was referred to was Paulus, so in your affidavit you mention his name and you say that you were five but that he was outside of the house.  Can you explain to me how this happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes.  Actually after I knew him on the time of our appearance at the law court, I decided because there was a lot of confusion during our appearance and I decided that ...(indistinct) the same statement as the other guys, we were five, but I never knew that guy, maybe other guys knew him before, or maybe my brother knew him, I never knew him before that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No but the impression gained reading this is that you were five at the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, I said that but that was wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then where did this agreement come from that you should mention this Paulus, all of you mention Paulus? When was such an agreement made that in your confessions you make mention of Paulus Masitsa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> It was during the discussion about the incident and they told me the police caught someone who was nearer to the farm by the name of Paulus Masitsa, so the guys, they said he should be involved in all this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I want you to have regard to page 40, that's where the confession starts.  Do you see that there is a date mentioned there, the 11th of February, 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And if I understood your testimony thus far, is that on the 11th you wanted to be discharged but instead of going out you were placed in this other cell where you were subsequently taken by police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And according to this, it was made the next day.  Where was this made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> I don't know Sir, I never made such a statement because what I remember on the 11th of February, it was the day I was supposed to be discharged at the hospital, it was Monday that day, if I remember well, it was Monday, so it is the day they took me to the other words where it was under guard, so this whole thing is new to me.  If you can go back to the calendar, the 11th was Monday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, let me correct myself, actually it's not a confession, it's a statement made by you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> I never made any statement that day, I just told the police that I knew nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> However, to say in your favour, that there is confusion, that is dated the 13th and if you look at the last page as well, 42, it's also dated the 13th of February, that's the confusion that arises now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Yes, Chairperson, I think the 11th is the date he was arrested in hospital, if you look at that.  Date of arrest - Arrested on the 11th, so I'm sure it's the date of the arrest, that's 11th, the following day on Monday at hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> For how long did you stay in hospital after you had been taken to this ward where there were guards?  How long did you stay there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Well, plus or minus because I went there on Sunday the 10th and on the 11th was the day I was taken to the other ward, plus or minus 3 to 4 days.  I don't recall exactly the days, but I think maybe on the 12th or on the 13th I was discharged from hospital forcefully by the police, not by doctor's instruction and I went right out of hospital with the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now if we have regard to page 42, look at point 42, it's written the signature there, King T. Lebea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, I can see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that your signature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now my brother asked you about these 5 people.  You recall what we asked your brother in respect of what we saw on page 5 or 6?  Let me just find it for you.  That on page 5, which is a response to questions asked by the Amnesty Committee of the TRC, that is your response starting on page 5 and if you have regard to page 6, down there it's written from Titus Lebea and King Lebea, do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And to be honest to you is that if you have regard to page 5, there are 2 emblems of the Pan Africanist Congress on both sides, that is left and right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And somewhere there is an address, Titus Lebea, on the right-hand side, 19050 Bophelong, Rocklands, Bloemfontein.  Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And if you look at on the left-hand side, I'm not sure about what is on top, but it would appear to me, it's not very clear but I see there 262 Vermeulen Street, Carl Klein Building, 6th Floor, Room (it's not very clear), 602 - 697 Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know were you author or co-author of this document which was a response to the questions asked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> I was a co-author.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And it says on page 5, 2.1 in the middle there</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>"After a thorough reconnaissance, I came to the conclusion that it will be attacked by a unit of 5, armed with 1 AK47 rifle and knife, with the sole intention of carrying the liberation struggle forwards through, as a means as applied in this case."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>The 5 crops up again, unit of 5.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir, I can see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why wasn't it easy to say to the Amnesty Committee:  "We were 4 after reconnaissance.  We said 5, but we went as a unit of 4"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> According to my brother who was the unit commander, he told me that he intended that we were about to be 5 when we attack, so unfortunately he didn't get the fifth guy, so what was he telling here, it was the intention and the whole plan, but during the commitment of the operation, we were only 4.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you told by your brother that after reconnaissance, he had realised that this operation could be carried out by 5 people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And if I listen to your evidence and his evidence at least marry each other in this respect that you were trained on the last day, let's forget what he said, but you were trained on the last day when the weaponry was delivered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were trained before the weaponry was delivered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And were you aware that reconnaissance had been done already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> No by that time I never knew the reconnaissance had been done because I never heard of any plan for the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you went to the farm, what was told to you why you should attack that farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> When I went to the farm, what was told was that we go and repossess.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you told about the location of the farm and how many people lived on that farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Actually I didn't told how many people were living there, the person who was having that information was my brother, how many were living there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What were you to repossess on that farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Whatever material that  can be used to help further the struggle of the Pan Africanist Congress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you went purely on that basis, that you would take whatever is of value and would assist this struggle of the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may continue, Mr Mbandazayo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Chairperson, I think the Committee has covered what I wanted to cover during the time of the interjection.  That's the evidence of the second applicant, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MBANDAZAYO</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think later we should talk about your fee because it would appear we've got a hand in it.  Mr Kachelhoffer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> As we're sitting here today, both you and your brother have already been released from prison, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Okay.  That particular day during the early morning hours, how many shots have you fired with that 9mm pistol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Plus or minus, I remember I fired up to 3 or 4, if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> To whom did you aim at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> At the first stage to Mr van Tonder and then later it was when I was outside, before we broke the kitchen door, because I thought Mr van Tonder was inside so as the lights were on, on the curtain I saw something like as if it was somebody and I shot through the windows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Did you at that stage realise that you hit Mrs van Tonder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> No, I realised on the first occasion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> That she has been shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> That I was shooting him, I didn't realise but I shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> No, no, I'm referring to Mrs van Tonder, did you realise that you have shot her as well in the process?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Well, it seems there is a little bit confusion here because what I wanted to stress out was that on the first occasion I shot Mrs van Tonder and then on the other occasions I shot through the window, so I never knew whom I was shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> So I'm asking, you didn't ..(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> Perhaps clear that up.  On the first occasion, how many shots did you fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> One.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> And did you hit anyone at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> On the first occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Yes, the first occasion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Mrs van Tonder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Mrs van Tonder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> So you will agree to the fact that she was hit in the chest by a 9mm bullet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Can you just repeat from your side what the actual order of your superiors was, regarding this particular attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> The order was to go and repossess.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Only that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Only as it is, to go and repossess.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Not to attack and injure any white farmers as well, in other words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> That was not specifically named like that, the order was to go and repossess.  When you go as a soldier, anyone who stands in front of you, you start with him or her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> So you have regarded it as a natural consequence, the fact that people might be injured in the process of repossession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> If there is a need to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Didn't you, during the reconnaissance process, consider the possibility to go to that particular farm whilst the people ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, no, no, Sir, he says he did not do that, he only went after the order was given that they must go and repossess, about the reconnaissance he knows nothing.  I covered that personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> As the Committee pleases.    So I take it that you will concede that Mr and Mrs van Tonder were both very seriously injured during this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> And from your testimony you clearly didn't bother about their well-being, but only about your brother's well-being at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> If one looks at the kind of weaponry used in this attack and the order as well and the measure of violence executed during this day on them, would you agree with me that they can regard themselves as lucky to be still alive today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I don't have any further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KACHELHOFFER</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Ms Mtanga, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Thank you Chair, just one question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS MTANGA:</span> Mr Lebea, what happened to the money and the jewellery that you said you put in a safe place at your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> The police retrieved the whole of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Then in your response to the request for further particulars when you said some items were discovered by the police, or recovered by the police, what did you understand to be the items not recovered by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Well, what I understood was that the information of the police played the role on that answer, because the estimation of what was taken, the estimation amount money and the estimation of the amount money of what was recovered, was differing, so there could have been the suspect that maybe one of us may have took something because it sometimes happens, so it's the way that word "some of items" came, so ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> I have no further questions Chairperson, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS MTANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Lebea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just to make a difference, could we say King Lebea, so that we don't refer to your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Okay Sir, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I hope you don't mind that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say some might have been taken according to what the police said.  Some might have been taken.  Were you all arrested, I mean all the operatives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir, but not on the same day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did - you said you stood at the door with your 9mm pistol, you recall saying so?  You didn't enter the house immediately, you entered the house after there was a lot of shouting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The others who entered the premises, that is the house, because we know that you entered through the window, how did they enter the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> The same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Through the window?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And according to you, the only time a door was broken, it was by you and that was the kitchen door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The front door, was it locked and it stood as it was?  It was, in other words never interfered with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> We never interfered with it, so I don't know whether was it locked or not locked, but it was closed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now this window where everybody gained entrance into the house, was it open when you arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> No, it wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you open it easily?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How then did you - how then did they enter the house if it was not opened easily?  Tell us what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> I broke it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> And then I opened it and then they started to enter and I was waiting outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand that, from your testimony, you evidence, that you did not do any reconnaissance but you were told that you go to this farm to repossess.  Now there's 4 of you, according to your evidence, what was each other's duty?  At least we know for you at least, you were standing outside.  What did you agree, who should do what?  We know about you.  What had Donosi to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> They were to enter and then attack and take whatever was to be taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Not mention made of who should do, for instance stand guard inside the house and the other one to collect the valuable items?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> No actually it wasn't like that.  It happened automatically when we arrived there that we decided that I wait outside and then they enter and do whatever they should do inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now what we know, we want you to help us out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that you have a 9mm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the AK47 was placed next to the car outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And your brother, Titus, testified that he had a panga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did Donosi and Samuel Mokweti have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> What I remember while entering by the time Mr van Tonder was making that noise, I saw my brother with a panga, Samuel Mokweti with a knife and Donosi with a spade, shovel or something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> Where did he get the spade from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> It belongs to Mr van Tonder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now tell us when you left, now that is the time going to the Mazelspoort farm, did Donosi have the knife with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So if I understand you correctly, it's just you and your brother who were armed, you with a 9mm pistol and your brother with a knife, with a panga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> With a panga and Samuel Mokweti with a knife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't know if I got everything as you say.  Let me repeat what I have here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You had a 9mm pistol, Titus Lebea, your brother, had a panga.</p>

<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> On your way to this farmhouse, did you visit people staying on the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> Who were you visiting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Actually we didn't come there as visitors, the place where we arrived, it seemed to me it was a place like a tavern where liquor, cool drink was sold there, so we had to enter there to wait until the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> While you were waiting there did you have any drinks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> No, Sir, we just waited there, posing like we were drinking, but we were not drinking as such, we were just waiting for the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> Now how do you pose to be drinking?  have you got a glass before you filled with something and then you pose to drink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> No, Sir, we bought only one quart of beer and then it was opened, but it just stayed there like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> You never consumed any liquor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Never.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> When you agreed all to make a similar statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> One of you, I just want to make sure who, Abram Smith made a statement</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>"On a certain farm we visited one Paulus and we started drinking.  Upon a suggestion from Sam we then went for a walk.  Sam wanted to show us the area.  We then approached the farmhouse"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>and then it's not quite clear but:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>"Then Sam said that he had a firearm and that we had to go and break in at the house."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>Is this correct, or wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> No, it's not correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> But you sat at this tavern for almost three hours, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> You sat at the tavern waiting for almost three hours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> It might be Sir, but I never counted how long we sat there, but it's possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> You knew nobody at that place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> No, I never knew anyone, it was for the first time I go there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> And you were visiting this place, pretending to be drinking, but you didn't drink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR K LEBEA:</span> Never as such, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> And you didn't know the owner of the tavern and you didn't know anybody at the place there?</p>

<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">ANDRIES DAVID JACOBUS VAN TONDER:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr van Tonder, you may be seated.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> May I proceed, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Certainly Mr Kachelhoffer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Mr van Tonder, could you explain to us, we have heard the background of what took place that evening, just with regard to the injuries that you incurred, could you explain to the Committee to what extent you were injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN TONDER:</span> Yes.  In the first case when I entered the door, they overwhelmed me with a panga and I tried to prevent this with my hand and in the process my fingers were chopped at this point.  They were chopped, my ear was chopped off, I was chopped in the skull, I also have chop marks on my shoulder.  There was previous evidence of the spade, the one said that they didn't have a spade, but they did indeed use a spade because when they took the shotgun off me, they attacked me with the spade because they dropped the panga, I don't know why, and my wife tossed it underneath the fridge, very fortunately so, because we could have been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>	They then hit me with the spade.  You can see that they assaulted me to such an extent that this knuckle of mine has been hit away completely due to the assault with the spade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>	My wife was shot through the chest with a 9mm pistol, she has the bullet to show to you.  It was a very traumatic experience for us because we are not accustomed to such things, we are not accustomed to being attacked at 2 o'clock in the morning.  One is sleeping peacefully and one doesn't expect something like this and all of a sudden you are woken from your sleep and assaulted, stabbed.  I wasn't healthy at that point, I was quite ill.  My wife supported me extensively and assisted me.  For us it was traumatic.  From our house she had to walk because they cut the telephone lines and we didn't have any telephonic contact with the outside world.  They left there in one of my vehicles.  I had the bakkie, but my wife walked in search of assistance.  For her it was traumatic, because she had to walk through the veld in order to get to a place where she could get help and after they left, I went back to the house and found the place in complete chaos as they had scratched around and tossed things about, everything was topsy-turvy.  I then found the keys to the bakkie and I struggled forth to Mazelspoort where I was looking for assistance from Mr Breedt, who then took me to the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>	When I arrived at the hospital, or at least when I arrived at Mr Breedt's place, I asked him whether or not my wife had arrived there and he said no, then I became very concerned but at least they found her, or at least I thought that they might have found her at the side of the road and further injured her, you can only imagine my distress.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>	I was taken into the hospital and they were giving me treatment because my ear had been chopped off, they were trying to fix my fingers, to reattach my fingers in the correct position, they were applying plaster of Paris.  Later they assured me that they had found my wife and that she was also in the hospital and that the bullet with which they had shot her was against her arm, it had not been fatal and the bullet was removed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>	I was in hospital for 14 days.  She spent less time in the hospital.  It was a complete disruption of our lives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> May I just ask you, after the incident, did this incident still haunt you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN TONDER:</span> Yes, of course, it is not something that one would forget about very easily.  If you are facing the barrel of a gun or a panga which is so sharp that it could kill you, because if I had not defended myself with my hand, I would probably not be here today to tell my story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Do you still have proper use of your left arm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN TONDER:</span> No, I do not, I cannot clench my fist properly, I can also not handle cutlery properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> How old were you and your wife at the stage of the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN TONDER:</span> I was 66.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> And your wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN TONDER:</span> She was the same age as I.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Just with regard to the applicants, I would like to know what happened between you and the applicants after we adjourned yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN TONDER:</span> I went out.  They apologised to my wife and I.  We are very grateful for that.  We are glad that they have come to that point of realisation where they could tell us that they are sorry.  We accepted their apology and outside they shook hands with my wife and I and they told me that they were very sorry about what had happened and I was very pleased that it came to that point and I thank them for this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Is there anything that you would like to add regarding your injuries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN TONDER:</span> No, I think that that is sufficient.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KACHELHOFFER</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Mbandazayo, surely there are no questions to ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> None, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR MBANDAZAYO</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Mtanga, surely?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> No questions, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MS MTANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr and Mrs van Tonder, this Committee is indebted to you to have come forward as victims.  This process is definitely made for that process that we reconcile with the horrendous past we all lived in and at an</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>advanced age like you are, to come and relive what obtained about 8 years ago, 8 to 9 years ago, it takes real courage because the events you have related to and the injuries sustained to you at such an advanced age, nobody would want to hear them again.  The Committee is indebted to you that you were able to come forward and reconcile with these people.  I think that's what we have, a better South Africa tomorrow and more especially for you and your wife, to know why this happened, why these people were attacking you, I think we are actually as a Committee overwhelmed by the courage you have shown.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>	Mr Mbandazayo, any submissions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO IN ARGUMENT:</span> Chairperson, I would just like to highlight some few aspects about this case.  Chairperson I will start first by saying that there is no dispute that the applicants were indeed members of the PAC.  Secondly Chairperson, there is no dispute that indeed Temba Ncapai was the Commander of APLA and also a member of the High Command.  Thirdly Chairperson, there is no dispute that the farm was attacked and as the victims have narrated that they suffered serious injuries and especially that they were of that advanced age at the time and they were unsuspecting during the</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a>ungodly hours of the day.  Now Chairperson, also there's no dispute that Temba Ncapai gave an order.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>	The aspect that I think I need to address is whether the applicants have made full disclosure before the Committee regarding the incident.  I say so, Chairperson and Honourable Members of the Committee because of the testimony of the first applicant and the second applicant, but I would like to start by saying, Chairperson, the two applicants have nothing to hide, or there's nothing they fear.  They were sentenced and they served their sentence.  They were out of jail, so there was nothing which prevented them, which in any way would make them to mislead the Committee about the events of the day, of that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>	Chairperson, why I'm saying so is because I would like the Committee to take the time elapsed after the incident up to now that this matter has been heard and to take into account that the applicants of course were in jail and of course when one is in jail, it's not a very healthy situation, you know, a conducive situation for somebody to live in.  Of course it's a place where people are punished, they have to serve their punishment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>	Chairperson the applicants, in a way they tell the Committee almost the same thing that happened about the events of the day, except on crucial issues like the first applicant, what was told by the first applicant on this, that what happened, the events that took place on the day in question are totally different to what the second applicant told the Committee.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>	Chairperson, it's my submission that in as much as they are different, Chairperson, looking and assessing, in my view their evidence is that in giving testimony, there was no intention on their part, deliberate intention on their part, to mislead the Committee about the events of the day.  I'm saying, I'm using the word intention, Chairperson, because there are instances where you can detect that people are doing it deliberately because they are hiding something or they are preventing some things to be known about what actually took place, but Chairperson, my assessment of their evidence is that there was no deliberate intention except that the first applicant, my assessment Chairperson is that he wanted to tell the Committee even about the events he did not experience, or see taking place, of what he thought what took place.  Like for instance, I may mention that he gave instructions that the goods should be disposed - should be hidden somewhere but in different places, but he comes and tells the Committee that everything was recovered and at the same time he does not even know what goods were repossessed at that farm.  He can't even tell the Committee what type of goods.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a>	The testimony now of the second applicant shows that at the time everything that took place at the farm, at that time he was unconscious because he has been shot.  Like for instance Chairperson he is denying that he was ever put in a rondavel, and which is clear that he was taken after he was shot, was put in a rondavel as the second applicant is testifying that he went back to the house to look whatever can help him to assist his brother.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>	So Chairperson, for him to hide that, Chairperson, I don't think, Chairperson, in any event one would say is deliberate because he wanted to hide something, there was nothing to hide, Chairperson, when somebody has been shot and he was put somewhere and they were trying to assist him, so definitely Chairperson, it is my submission that whatever the differences in their testimony are, it's not deliberate, that it was the intention to hide something or not to tell the Committee exactly what took place.  You  can detect from the second applicant the honest answers he gives that, you know, "You didn't even care about the victims."   "Yes, we didn't care about the victims, I was concerned with my brother."  Everything.  The first applicant did not even tell the Committee that his brother was also admitted in hospital, maybe he did not know about that, that he was subsequently admitted or that also his brother was shot, which indicates that he was not in a position to be able to know what actually took place in the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>	Now the other aspect Chairperson which I think is of concern is the question of - in their statements to the police which kept on there is this fifth person, Chairperson, who keeps on cropping up and also in their response to the further particulars to the Committee that, Chairperson, initially of course they mention that initially it was intended that it will be five, but it ended up being four people and also when they were talking to the police, when they gave statement to the police they said five.  Chairperson, I wouldn't like to pretend as if I know the solution to this, but Chairperson it's my experience that most of the time you always find that the information given to the police is not always correct.  It's not always correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mbandazayo, what weight should be attach to it, that we find that they say in the statements given to the police that there is this Paul Masitsa and in the response to questions asked by the Amnesty Committee, they say yes, when we reconnoitred, we realised that we had to be five to execute this mission, what weight should we attach to that in our deliberations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Chairperson, I'm just going there, I just want to tie in this sense, Chairperson.  My submission rightly or wrongly Chairperson is that there should not be much weight Chairperson, taking into account that at the end of the day, even though in their statement they say they were five, Chairperson, at the end of the day the people who were charged and convicted were the four people, of this offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Can I just ask, if we find the explanation given in regard to this fifth person, if we find that unsatisfactory, is that necessarily fatal for the application?  In other words, would that constitute a failure to give a full disclosure on the relevant facts of the matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Thank you Chairperson, Honourable Members of the Committee.  Chairperson, it depends, Chairperson, whether, if the Committee finds that there was a fifth person or there was a deliberate intention Chairperson, the question that would be asked if there was a fifth person, why this fifth person has not been mentioned.  Now, definitely Chairperson, it depends on what perspective one sees, one would say why is this person being always sheltered, no one is wanting to come up with this fifth person, why are they hiding this person?  What information maybe can come up to light if this person is known?  Maybe ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But is it not for you, Mr Mbandazayo, to tell us, look there is this fifth person who didn't come to light here and why we should disregard him, not that we should take a perspective, but you assist us in your submissions why we shouldn't - why we should look at it in a different - or persuade us and say:  "You look at it this way."</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Chairperson ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> Ja, perhaps we could still get clarity on that.  Mr Kachelhoffer, were only four accused charged?  Can you establish this from your clients?  Were there four or were there five?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Chairperson, my instructions are that he is aware of four.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> The fifth person who has been referred to apparently resided on the farm.  Do they know this person who has been referred to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN TONDER:</span> I do not know Petrus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> Do you not know of a shebeen or a tavern which was there on the farm, because  or at least on a neighbouring farm where such a Petrus could have resided?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN TONDER:</span> There was a Sam who lived there.  I heard that these persons were on the neighbouring farm before they attacked us, that is what I heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> And on the neighbouring farm, where would they have been, with whom, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN TONDER:</span> No, I don't know with whom they were because there are various huts there and I don't know who they were visiting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Let me be blunt, Chairperson.  My contention and my submission is that the Committee should not attach weight on this fifth person, Chairperson, because this fifth person, Chairperson, in as much as he's mentioned, Chairperson, there is no role which comes up even in court Chairperson, definitely if Chairperson, this person was part of the attack on the victims' farm, definitely he would have been charged, he would have been the fifth person, so it's clear Chairperson that this fifth person was never part of this attack.  So Chairperson, it's my submission that this fifth person should not be taken into account with regard to this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>	Chairperson, without wasting time, Chairperson, it's my submission that therefore Chairperson, in terms of Section 20 (1) and also (ii) the applicants have met the requirements of the said sections and that the Committee should grant them amnesty as applied and as such, Chairperson, unless the Committee would like me to address it on any other specific point, that's  my submissions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Mbandazayo.  Mr Kachelhoffer, any submissions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER IN ARGUMENT:</span> Chairperson, just in short, as the Committee realises, the victims in this application don't make any objection to the granting of amnesty to these applicants.  Concerning the point of the four or five members who took part in the attack on the farm, I can just mention that my submission in this regard is, if it was four, five, or ten who had attacked this farm, it wouldn't have made a difference.   The incident has been described I think from my side objectively and also was done in a very open manner, I think especially applicant number 2, if you have to look at his evidence objectively, it was very open.  	So in short, we do not have any problem with the granting of amnesty and I think concerning the victims, I think it would be apt to refer it to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, just when you are there, I see we've got a postal address for Mr and Mrs van Tonder.  Do they have a physical address?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Mr Chairman, can you just repeat, sorry, about the postal address?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I have a box postal address, do they have a physical address so that if we referred them to the Committee on Reparation and Rehabilitation, they would be easier to be found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> Mr Chairman, they're staying on a farm outside Glen known as Safier, the farm Safier, that is the only physical address which is known to me.  I don't know whether the Committee can work through our office address maybe, my firm's address, I don't know whether that is appropriate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will do that if it's easier to do that.  ...(indistinct - mike not on), but your colleague there, McIntyre and van der Post, 12 Baum Street, Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR KACHELHOFFER:</span> That is indeed my physical work address.  My postal address is P O Box 540 Bloemfontein, 9300.  I don't know whether you need my work telephone number as well, that is (051) 5050200, if that would be of any help.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Anything would be of help that we could conduct some communication, thank you Mr Kachelhoffer.  ms Mtanga, any brief submissions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> No Chairperson, I would like to leave this matter in your hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>NO SUBMISSIONS BY MS MTANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mbandazayo, you don't have a reply?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> None, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>NO REPLY BY MR MBANDAZAYO</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  This brings us to the conclusion of the applications of Mr Titus Lebea and Mr King Lebea.  We are going to reserve our decision.  It will be delivered within the next three weeks in writing and all parties involved would be advised, but before we adjourn for lunch, I wish to thank the legal representatives in this matter, that you have been of great assistance to us and what you have been doing will definitely be taken into consideration to come to a just decision.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>	Ms Mtanga, I don't think the other matters are ready, are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> No, Chairperson, the next matter that we are to move on is the Thejane application and as discussed in chambers, the representative of Mr Thejane will only be here after lunch, so I would like to request the Committee to allow Mr Mbandazayo to consult with Mr Pudumo, who is also supposed to come next on - today, on today's role.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's take the important business of adjourning and excusing those who would not be involved in the coming matters.  Thank you very much Mr Kachelhoffer.  Thank you very much Mr and Mrs van Tonder.  Go well.  We shall adjourn for lunch.  We shall resume at 1.30.</p>
