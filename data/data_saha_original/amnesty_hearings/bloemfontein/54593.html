<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> At this point I would hand over to Mr Mthembu to lead evidence.</p>

<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> Page 8.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Could I suggest in future where we are going to have lists prepared and indexes as in this case that it would be convenient to have the applications in the same order as the names appear on the list on the index.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> Point taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR MTHEMBU:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Leeuw is it correct that you have applied for amnesty in respect of certain offences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes it is so, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Could you tell this Committee which offences are those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> It is for murder and robbery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Can I proceed Mr Chair?  Mr Leeuw at the time of the commission of these offences were you a member or affiliated to any political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I was a member of PAC of Azania.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, before going over to the - robbery of what, where, when, who did he rob, who did he murder and what was the dates so that we could then get all the particulars that we need.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Point taken Sir.  Mr Leeuw would you explain to this Committee for which murder and robbery were you convicted for and for which you are now applying for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> It is for the murder committed to Mr R J J Fourie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Is it correct that you are charged with the murder of Mr R J J Fourie  who was a farmer at Verkeerdevlei and his farm was called the Stormberg Farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes, I was charged for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> And is it further correct that you, and your co-accused in this matter, you murdered and thereafter robbed the late Mr Fourie as well as a female person who was in the company of the late Mr Fourie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes, our intention was not to rob.  Mr Fourie was against the liberation of Africans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir I will come to the motive.  My question now is, is it correct that you murdered the said Mr (late) Fourie and a female person who was in his company and that</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>you robbed them both of certain articles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes we murdered Mr Fourie.  We did this under the PAC operation which was heeded by Sabelo Palma(?) ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Leeuw sorry to interrupt you.  Please answer my questions.  I will ask you for the details when the need be, please Sir.  Now can you tell this Committee what happened during the murder of Mr Fourie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> We murdered Mr Fourie and we searched his house and took whatever was necessary.  We took his car so that we should be able to assist the organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Is it correct that you and your co-accused planned this incident and that you were actually in Verkeerdevlei two days before this incident to conduct reconnaissance at that farm which is called Stormberg Farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes we did go there, Stormberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Is it further correct that you and your co-accused in fact waylaid Mr Fourie at the gate leading to his farm and that you closed the gate so that he could climb out of his vehicle to close the said gate, then at that moment you would attack him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes we did that exactly.  We closed the gate so that we should be able to catch him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Is it further correct that indeed Mr Fourie alighted from his vehicle and whilst he was busy opening the gate and when he turned around to approach his vehicle that you shot him once in the chest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Is it further correct that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Just a minute I don't think that's how we should lead evidence.  I think ask him to tell us what</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Would you then proceed to tell this Committee what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> We arrived on that farm on the 12th of February.  When that car passed, going towards the direction of the town we closed the gate so that when they came back we should be able to catch them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Yes, and then what happened?  Go on to tell us what happened, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> When he came back we were still waiting by the gate, it was still closed.  We closed it on purpose so they should be able to attack him when he tries to open the gate.  And when he alighted the vehicle I attacked him.  When he fell down I grabbed this woman who tried to get out of the car and Daniel Magoda and Mishek May removed Mr Fourie and put him in the bush. We took this White woman and put her in the car and we went into the house.  We took the same keys that were in the car and opened the house.  When we got inside we put this White woman on a chair. Mishek May and Daniel Magoda and Petrus Nkgwedi, we clapped this White woman and she was being watched by Mishek May.  My main intention was to get the keys to the safe because we were looking for the firearms that were kept in the safe.  We needed those firearms in order to operate for the PAC struggle.  We found the old coins in the safe and we took that with us.  ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Sorry, did you find any firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> How many?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> It's a 3.8 firearm and a small one called Baby Brown.  When I came back to check Daniel Magoda and Mishek May I found that this woman was no longer on the chair and I realised that she was in the bedroom.  And she had a loudspeaker and I told the gentlemen that the policemen must not find us there.  Then I dismantled the loudspeaker.  We went into the car and we drove off to Botshabelo.  We threw out the loudspeaker and the telephone.  We took these things and kept them in separate places so that the police shouldn't find them in one place.  Mishek May left with the car and we managed to hide away these things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I am talking about the coins that we found in the house, and the clothing, and there were also some groceries in the car because it seems that they had just come from doing groceries in town.  Those are the things that we took.  And we took all these things to Botshabelo.  Mishek May left with the car and he went with it to the D Section and we were arrested after two days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> You said when Mr Fourie came out of the car you attacked him, what do you mean thereby?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> How many times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> With one bullet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> With whose gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> It's a .38 special gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Whose gun was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> It was Mr Showa's (?) gun, after the instruction that he gave us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> By the way who was this Mr Showa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> He was an APLA Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> We've heard mention of a woman who was accompanying Mr Fourie, I am not asking the applicant, I am asking the evidence leader, do we know who this person is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> No, we don't have a record of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Wasn't she mentioned at the trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was the name Mrs May?  Is that correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Has she been given notice of this hearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> No she hasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Why not?  She was clearly a victim wasn't she?  Someone who could give very relevant information as to precisely what was stolen from the house.  It's extremely important when one is trying to ascertain what the purpose of an act is, whether there was personal gain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> What I did is I asked the matter to be investigated by the Investigative Unit and I've got a report back from them and it doesn't mention Mrs May.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Sorry could I ask - when I mentioned the name Mrs May you said yes, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes that is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did you know her before the event?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> No I did not know her before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Any one of your co-accused, did they know her before the event?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I don't think they knew her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did any one of you know Mr Fourie before the event?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes I knew him well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did you work for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes I worked for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did Mrs May give evidence at your trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes she was present in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did she give evidence?  Did she go into the witness box?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes she did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Now Mr Leeuw, besides having worked for Mr Fourie how else did you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Mr Fourie was one of the people who was in charge of training, he was one of the commanders in the army.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Now at the time when you were working for him, where were you staying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I was staying on the very same farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> For how long did you stay at this farm, and when did you leave it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I stayed there for 15 years, I actually grew up there.  I left there in 1975.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Now Mr Leeuw would you tell this Committee what is the political objective that you sought to achieve?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Our political objective as a branch of the Operation Grand Storm and as he was the leader of the Free State branch he gave us the instruction to attack these farms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I see here Sir on your application form for amnesty, paragraph 7(b), you state that the organisation, the movement concerned or your membership that you were actually a member of the task force, could you explain to this Committee what was the objectives of the task force and it's link with APLA and/or PAC operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Task force is closely linked with APLA, it had</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>to assist APLA in it's attacks on these farms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> So were members of the task force also members of APLA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Task force and APLA were separate entities but they assisted each other in attacking the farms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> What was the relationship, if any, between the task force and the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> The relationship between the task force and the PAC is that they all formed part of APLA.  They were the military wing of APLA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> You surely must be incorrect here.  PAC was not a military wing.  We know that the military wing of the PAC was APLA, not the other way round, isn't that so?  APLA was the military wing of the PAC,  not the other way round.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> APLA is the military wing of the PAC, and we as the task force assisted APLA in attacking the farmers according to the order by Sabelo Pama in 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Leeuw you mentioned Operation Great Storm, would you tell this Committee what you know about Operation Great Storm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Operation Great Storm was a joint venture of APLA and the task force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> During the launch of Operation Great Storm in 1991 there were certain objectives of Great Storm that were enunciated, would you tell this Committee about some of those objectives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes I can.  Operation Great Storm was formed in order to assist APLA to attack the farm owners because they were assisting apartheid regime by training women and children and they were also in the police force in the special branches.  They were assisting in the oppression of</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>the Africans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir were you a member of the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes it is so Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> When did you join it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I joined in September 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Have you received any military training of whatsoever kind, and if so what was the type thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> The training that I received was through John Showa who came with Oupa Kohla who were within in prison.  He introduced John Showa to us and that was in June and he trained us and thereafter he did this in a house no. 337 in Botshabelo.  He used AK47 firearms and a 3.8 and a Scorpion and a handgrenade and an R1.  After June he left and he said he would come back in November.  That was in 1991, in June, when he promised to come back in November.  He did as he promised and he trained us again.  And he brought one gun, 3.8 Special and left it with us and he said the rest of the armoury we will find it wherever we go and do our jobs.  And he left the word that we must start working and go forward with the African struggle.  And that's when I started getting together Daniel Magoda, Mishek May and Petrus Nkgwedi.  We got all the training in June and in November again he trained us all again and left us only with this 3.8 gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir do you have any justification that your acts were committed with a political objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes this offence was with a political objective because it was in accordance with an order given by our commander that we must attack those farmers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Your commander is the gentleman set out in your application form, Comrade Jan Showa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Do you know where he is now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> He is late.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, after having killed Mr Fourie why did you spare Mrs May?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> We did not see any reason for killing Mrs May.  We were just beating her.  It was just to let her pay the price and to show those who assisted in apartheid regime as to what will happen to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did you know her or anything about her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> No I did not know her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So you don't know if she did in fact assist in the apartheid regime in any way?  She may have been a fierce opponent, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I could not take any decisions about her because it was the first time I saw her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> You say amongst the articles that you took, they included items of clothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Why did you take the clothing away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> By taking these clothes, it was the command that was given that we should take everything that we can assist those who were disadvantaged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Did you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes I did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> To whom did you give that clothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> These clothes were confiscated by the police.  They were taken before we could do whatever with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> After how many days were you arrested by the way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> After two days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> And the coins that you found in the safe, why did you also remove that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> We also had to take that and hand that over to the organisation so that they should assist the APLA soldiers that were still in the bush, so that the struggle should go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> And the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> We took this car and the Organisation was to decide what's going to be done with this car.  It was to assist the APLA soldiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> But now how would that vehicle have assisted your soldiers, using your words, knowing that that vehicle was stolen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Our taking this car, the intention was to get transport to Botshabelo and this car could generate income to assist the Africans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> I don't understand you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> We were going to hand this car over to John Showa.  He was going to make a decision about it, because he's the one who gave the order that if we can find a car we shouldn't leave it behind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> You talk about generating income to the Africans through this vehicle, that's the part I do not understand, how can a car generate income?  It is an expense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> A car helps in an organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> How can it generate income, or did you make a mistake by saying so?  It needs repairs and petrol must be put into it, the tyres must be replaced, it's just an expense, how can it generate income?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> The car helps in the Organisation because we can help the soldiers with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Sorry, but the soldiers haven't got money because you are stealing money to give to the soldiers, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> By taking these things doesn't mean we were stealing.  We are doing this under the order of the Organisation.  We repossess what the Whites didn't bring in this country in order to assist those disadvantaged in the Organisation, people who need clothing and everything that can help them survive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I can understand the Boere or the farmers didn't bring their - or the Whites didn't bring the car into the country but neither did the Blacks, because there were no cars in this country. But to follow up on the question my learned brother asked you, you said you wanted this car to generate income, now that - the people must then pay for the car or pay taxi fees, isn't that so, if you want to get income from the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> The commander would know about that because he's the one who told us about the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> What did he tell you about the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> We hadn't met him yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Ja, but before you went, what did he say about the car?  Because it was interpreted, that he said you should leave the car behind....</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> No, "not" leave the car behind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Not leave the car behind, oh, I missed the word "not".  Right, did you steal any, or did you take any</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>other cars without killing people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> By taking this car we were actually getting what the Africans need.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But you could get cars, they are parked round in the streets here, why didn't you get a car here, or in Verkeerdevlei on the street corner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> We took the car where we did the job so that it should transport us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So that was for your personal use the car, to transport you, to get away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes we took it until we can get to the Commander, according to the instruction given by him because Organisation was independent, we didn't have any financial support.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> How did you get to the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> We used public transport that goes to Brandfort and we used some footpaths to go to the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You knew the vicinity very well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You left there in 1975?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So for 15 years you weren't on the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> How old was Mr Fourie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I do not know how old he was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Wasn't he an old man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> No he was not an old man, he was just an adult.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Because in the verdict here the Court says, the Judge, that they were two elderly people, aged people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I don't believe that, it was not two elderly people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Leeuw you have applied for amnesty and you have to play open cards with this Committee and just speak the truth.  That vehicle, you knew it was stolen and you knew it could not be used on any public road because the police would easily have traced it, isn't that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Now explain to this Committee how that vehicle could have been used in operations and how it could have assisted the Organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> This car would be of great help in the Organisation.  We could possibly sell its parts so as to assist the APLA soldiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> But you are speculating now, are you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Well I thought you said that it was for the Commander to decide what would happen with the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> According to the question I would explain that it might generate some income.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir is there any particular reason why Stormberg Farm was singled out amongst all the other farms in the Verkeerdevlei area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I chose that route.  There were other farms that were targeted as well.  I chose Stormberg Farm as the first one because all the things that I knew were on that farm were needed in the Organisation and the owner was the commander in the army.  He played a role in apartheid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Tell me this, the lady who was with Mr Fourie, was she a so-called White person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I am not sure to which race did she belong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> What do you think to what race she could have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> She was English speaking, she couldn't speak Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> But many English-speaking people are White, that's why I asked you whether she was White.  I didn't ask you whether she was Afrikaans or whatever, I just asked you whether she was White.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes, she was a White person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir you mentioned that the late Mr Fourie was the commander of an army but he was clearly a farmer, what do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> You referred in your testimony to this Committee that Mr Fourie (Speaker's microphone is not on) ...because he was a commander in the army, if I heard you correctly, but you lived on his farm, you knew he was not in the army, what do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> During the weekends the farmers used to go to the police station and they used to assist the policemen and he was in command in this particular army of theirs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir the next of kin of the late Mr Fourie, as well as that of Mrs May are not here today, but what would you like to say to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I would like to say I am very remorseful about the death of the deceased and therefore I am asking for forgiveness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did your father work for Mr Fourie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> My grandfather did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And how long did he stay there for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> My grandfather passed away in 1994.  He died on that farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So he was on the farm when you came and murdered Mr Fourie there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> He was dead when I killed Mr Fourie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I thought you said 1994.  You said he died in 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> '74, 1974, I said 1974.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir do you have anything that you wish to add?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I'd like to add on by saying that it is due to John Showa instructions and I also ask for forgiveness from the deceased's family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Do you know any of the children of Mr Fourie or didn't he have children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes I would be able to recognise them if I see them.  He had two children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Were they grown-ups when you left or were they still young?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> They were married already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did they have children already at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I think it's like that as far as I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And do you know where they lived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> No Sir, I didn't know where they stayed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did you have any grudge against Mr Fourie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did he treat you well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> No he did not treat me well.  He even took my father's cattle and my aunt as well, he hated Black people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And so you - but that did nothing to you, you didn't have a grudge against him because he hated Black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes he did something to me because even my own</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>cows are still with him and my aunt's and even his promises he never fulfilled them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Are your cattle still, at the time when you murdered him, your cattle were still on the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I believe he had sold them by then because the cows that he had were quite a number then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And did you ever go back to him and ask for your cows?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I would be asking for trouble if I did that, because he didn't want people to visit his farm.  And moreover the people he dispossessed things, and therefore when we went there we wanted to repossess what was originally ours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So you went there to repossess what was yours, and that was inter alia your cattle or the cattle he sold, you wanted your money back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But why did - apart from anything you knew the farm, he in fact stole your cattle, and you were not interested in getting it back or taking revenge on him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> No I was not taking revenge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But for 20 years you didn't bother to go and enquire to find out what had happened to this cow of yours, is that so?  Did you never make any enquiries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I never made any enquiries, it's because should I go there he would fight me, against me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> How many cattle did you have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> It was three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Three cows?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Where did you get them from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> From my grandfather.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> What did you mean by saying that you went there to go and repossess what was yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> To explain this, as we are attacking the farmers we were repossessing what was originally the Africans', it did not belong to the farmers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Is that your testimony Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MTHEMBU</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could you just give us an indication of the goods you in fact took from the house, the clothing, what clothing?  Did you take all the clothing in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> No we didn't take all the clothing in the house.  We found those coins and the two firearms and a camera and those clothes.  And the groceries were already in the car because they had come with the groceries already in the car from wherever they came from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> At what time did they leave the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> It was at about one o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> What day of the week was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I don't remember clearly, but it was on the 12th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> 12th of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> February.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> 12th of February 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But it was during the week, it wasn't a Saturday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes it was during the week.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And at what time did they return?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> If I remember clearly it was at about six o'clock, because when we attacked them it was just almost sunset.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So from one o'clock until six o'clock they were away from the farm and you could have gone to the house and you could have taken everything you wanted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes, but the purpose was to attack the White people who were oppressing through the apartheid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So you didn't go there to get stock for the PAC you in fact went to attack the White people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> We were going to attack a White person but the order that we got from the commander was to attack the farm and this was the first farm and thereafter there were several other farms that were targeted as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Ja, but I want to have the - if you could help me in this respect, you could have taken the clothing, you could have taken the guns without killing the people but it was part of your objective to kill the people and take the goods as well, or was it only your objective to take goods in order to assist the APLA soldiers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> We got this order from the commander, we didn't do this voluntarily.   We got an instruction from the commander to attack the farmers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You attacked the farmers and to get their possessions, did you also get the instruction from the commander to kill the farmer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> He did not specifically point out this farmer, I chose it specifically.  I chose it as the first farm to attack and then we can proceed to the rest.  And then we will take whatever we've got to the commander the next time</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>we meet him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Ja, no that's exactly what I say.  He instructed you to go and fetch groceries and clothing and whatever you could get and bring it back to him.  Did he also instruct you to shoot the people and bring the corpse to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Maybe we can divide it into instalments, did he instruct you to kill people, to kill the farmers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes, John Showa gave us the instruction to kill the farmers so that the country should be back to the Africans because this land was never in the hands of the people, so it had to return to the hands of the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> It wouldn't have mattered if he was a commander in the army you had to kill the farmers because they were in possession of the land?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> In order to get the land back we got the order from the military that we had to repossess the land and hand it back to the Africans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Ja, and you would have taken as a target any farmer who had land?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> That is why we targeted that farm and we will proceed to the next farm after we have finished with that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Until you have repossessed all the farms around there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> So that these farms must belong to the Africans because the land was dispossessed by the White people. The APLA wanted the land to belong back to the Black people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So it wouldn't matter whether the farmer belonged to the army or whether he assisted the police, the fact that he had land that was the reason why you attacked</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>farmers, or anticipated to attack farmers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> The objective of APLA and the task force was to attack the farms in order to take back the land of the Africans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY ADV THABETHE:</span> Mr Leeuw can you briefly explain to the Committee exactly what instructions were you given by Mr Showa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> The instructions given by Mr Showa was to do our work and to continue with our war against the farmers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> Did he specifically tell you which farms to attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> No he did not specify which farms, he just said farmers in general.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> So you chose the farm owned by Mr Fourie, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> What were the reasons for you to choose that farm?  Would I be correct, or would I be wrong if I say it was for your own personal experiences with him, the fact that he took your cattle, he didn't treat you well, would I correct if I say that, the reasons for you to choose Mr Fourie's farm, specifically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> The reason why we chose Mr Fourie's farm was to get the arms that we needed in order to use.  At that time John Showa explained to us that we cannot get arms in the country, we can only get them if we attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> What I am trying to find out from you is your choosing Mr Fourie had nothing to do with your personal experiences with him, is that what you are telling the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes it was not for personal enrichment but just</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>to find the arms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But he had very few arms compared to most farmers, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> One .38 and a Baby Browning, which was useless for your purposes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So why choose him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> The reason was to get arms on that farm in order to continue with the African struggle, not targeting specifically Mr Fourie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> Can I continue, can I proceed?   Can anybody from - since Mr Showa is late, can anybody from the APLA authorities verify what you have just told the Committee members about the instructions that were given to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes there is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> Can you tell the Committee the name of that person please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> The person who was with John Showa and accompanied him during all this training was Oupa Khotle and we were with him in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Is he in prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Grootvlei Maximum Prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So he's available there now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes he's still inside in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Leeuw you stole a motor vehicle in 1987, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I was needing that car when I stole it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Sorry, your answer, I couldn't hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I did not steal a car in 1988 as I was in the Organisation, my joining the Organisation was with the intention of assisting the APLA army.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> In 1987?  That was not this car, before this car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes in 1987 I've got a car theft case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Ja, and you were convicted of car theft, of stealing a car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And in 1974 you were also convicted of stealing, theft?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And in 1984 you were also convicted of fraud, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> No that I don't understand clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Didn't you try to change a document in 1984 in order to get money or falsification of a document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> No Sir I don't remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Were you convicted of any offence in 1984?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I only remember the car issue and the theft.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Only two convictions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes I can only remember the two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> When you say you remember only the two, what do you mean, are you implying that it is possible there might have been a third conviction but you might have forgotten about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> That I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Is it possible then that you could have been convicted of some offence in 1984, quite apart from the motor car theft in 1987 and theft in 1974?  Is it possible that you could have been convicted in 1984?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> No Sir I don't recall them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> But - thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Have you got the previous convictions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Mr Leeuw I would expect you to remember ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> Yes we do.  Can I refer the Committee to the relevant page.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Can I complete my question please if you don't mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> Oh sorry, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> I would expect you to remember whether or not you were convicted, can you really forget that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> If there is a case, maybe if you can tell me where and when maybe I will remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> According to the judgment you were convicted in 1974 for theft.  In 1984 forgery, page 7 of the judgment, and issuing a falsified document.   There was nothing like say a driver's licence or anything falsified, or your ID document or some sort of document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I don't remember because I got my licence in 1982 in Randfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> What happened to this vehicle that you have stolen in 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> It is still at my uncle's yard.  I went to prison for that.  When I came back I took it to my yard.  It was in Botshabelo at that time.  And the person who was charging me for the case he never said it was his car, but it was similar to his car.  The engine is still in the car and the gearbox, in the boot of the car in Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> Mr Chairman the previous convictions</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>mentioned in page 7 of the judgment which is Section P </p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> (Speaker's mike is not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> Ja, it's not in the SAP69, we've got the SAP69 but they only refer to Annexure A which I don't have.  So we don't have a SAP69 previous convictions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Have you got an SAP69 form for this applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> No we don't.  Mr Leeuw you say in your evidence your intention was not to rob Mr Fourie, exactly what was your intention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> My intention to take Mr Fourie's property was to find what was needed by the Organisation so that we would be able to continue with the APLA struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> Mr Chair at some stage you enquired whether the victims were old or they were young, I just want to - I have no further questions for Mr Leeuw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Thank you.   Neither of us put our microphones on for that, I think it should be recorded that there was no re-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MTHEMBU</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You wanted to say something about the age of the victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> Yes I did Member of the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> In Section C, page 3, right down at the end there are particulars of the victims where it mentions that the man was 70 years and the woman was 74 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Sorry where is that, I am sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">ADV THABETHE:</span> Section C page 3.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Well perhaps then I would like to recall the applicant because he told us it was only adult people, they weren't elderly people.  Could the applicant please come....</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">H LEEUW:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Would you consider a person of 70 years and a woman of 74 years of age as elderly people or only as adults?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I don't understand, because in a fight you don't - we don't regard age, how old are you.  In a state of war we don't case whether you are young or old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So you didn't worry whether they were young or old?  You knew all the way round they were old Mr Leeuw, wasn't that the fact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> In our struggle PAC didn't make any division or any distinction as whether they are old or young.  We go on with the African struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Leeuw that's not what I've been asking you, what the people considered in the struggle.  You knew these people were old, they were 70 years and over 70 years and you tried to give the impression that they were only adult people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I would ask the Committee as to whether in during the fight, in a state of war do you make any distinction between those people who were young or old?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You picked this old man as a target, you have told us you chose him, I suggest you did it because you thought he was an old man who couldn't defend himself, and it has nothing to do with war.  It was your choice of him as a target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> To choose that farm we didn't pay any attention to the age, we only concentrated as to whether how can we</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>enhance our struggle so that we'll get some assistance in that farm so as to continue our struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Well how did that farm get to the top of your list?  A farm that had one measly firearm in it, why was it the first choice amongst all the farms you had been told to attack, can you give any reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> For us to prioritise this farm is because it has arms in it because Mr Fourie was one of those people who were senior within - or let me say during the weekend when they were collaborating with the police together with other White people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> That was 15 years ago or more, 15, 16 years ago, you hadn't been back since then you told us.  He was now an old man, that you must have known.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> That's not true Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What's not true, had you been back there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> After that I didn't go back to that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> After you left there in 1975 had you been back after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> Yes I didn't go back again after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So you had no idea what he had been doing after 1975, except that he was now 15 years older?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> What was important to us was not the age, what was important was to go on with the APLA struggle against the farmers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You have not given one valid reason why you should have made him your first choice, can you do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I did explain that for us to prioritise this farm was that Mr Fourie had many arms, for us to get these two arms was not important for us to get other arms or to search for other arms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But we know it's not true, he didn't have many arms.  You found one weapon there of any use to you, so don't come and tell us stories about knowing he had lots of arms.  Hasn't your attorney told you that you must be honest and frank with us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I am telling the truth, there is no lie I am telling, I am telling the whole truth.  Mr Fourie was one of those people who had many arms in the farms.  We only took those who we thought they are important to us and were able to take.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Are you now suggesting you left other arms behind?  Please....</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> I have to believe that we did.  We searched for keys to open other safes, we didn't get those keys, therefore we were not able to get other arms there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Was there more than one safe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> There was another small safe, it was this kind of small, which we didn't get the keys for, for that safe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> You were not able to open that safe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> (No interpreted reply)</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Will you indicate the size again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEEUW:</span> It was at that distance, the length was that size and the width was that size.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> 18 inches high and a foot wide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> So you were not able to open that safe?</p>
