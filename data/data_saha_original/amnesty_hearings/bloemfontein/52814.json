Your Honour, the date on which this took place was 1992, April 7th and it took place at Sentra Hypersave, that's a business complex in Vaalpark, Sasolburg in the Free state.  Your Honour, what happened there, like I've said before, I was a commander of the Detective Branch at Sasolburg.  Round about December 1991 and January 1992 an informant came to talk to me with regards to certain illegal diamond transactions.  Because of the fact that we did not deal with these kind of matters I contacted the Gold and Diamond Branch in Randburg in order to be of assistance to us.  She was helped by them and I accepted that she was happy with the course of events which happened afterwards.\n\tIt was round about two months later that she contacted me again and then told me that she was not happy with the way the specific unit handle things because she did not receive any reparation.  She also gave me information with regards to illegal firearm transactions.  I contacted the Gold and Diamond Branch in Welcome to help her.",

Your honour, she informed me that certain gang members as mentioned were involved in the illegal distribution and buying of firearms, amongst others, AK guns, hand grenades, explosives and I told her that I'd try to use the firearm units to help her.  As far as I know she was also informed by the Gold and Diamond Branch to deal with the firearms unit in Eikenhof.\n\tRound about the last week of March 1992 Mrs de Lange came to me again and asked me if I could not help her to infiltrate the so called gang.  She also explained to me it was very dangerous for her as a woman to go and do this questioning because all of this happened in the Black areas.\tDetective Sergeant Chris Fouche, I introduced him to her and Fouche was a member of the Detective Branch in Sasolburg.",

            "I'll get to the point.  At that stage she did not tell me exactly who they were, she only mentioned the gang.  Sergeant Fouche then started working together with her.  The reason why I used Sergeant Fouche was because in September the previous year he only started working at the Detective Branch in Sasolburg and then he was unknown with the Black areas in the Vaal Triangle and nobody would have known that he was a police member.  The rest of my unit was well known in the Vaal Triangle, specifically the Black areas that is.\n\tAll the information which I found afterwards was coming from Fouche and also from De Lange and on certain occasions a Black man with the name of Joseph who worked with Fouche.  De Lange now acted as Fouche's informant and like I've already told you all the information afterwards was reported to me by the two of them.  I trusted Fouche, he informed me that he was taken to the gang and he was introduced as her brother with the name of Brown.  Sergeant Fouche reported back to me but most of these people were trained M.K. members and this issue was also confirmed by Elsa and once again I'd like to assure you that I trusted the information they gave me.\n\tOn a certain day Fouche brought me a 635 Baby Brown Pistol as well as a 12 cartridge shotgun and these were weapons which he bought from these members of the gang.    Your honour these weapons, I tried to find the owners by asking questions at the National Weapon Register.  The 635 mm was not stolen, it was licensed under the name of Mr Elderley and was the same with the shotgun, it was not registered but I would like to tell you that the series number on the shotgun was removed and another number was engraved on this - M992.  It was known to me that it was similar to which the Municipal  Component of the Police in Sebokeng marked their weapons.\n\tFouche assured me that the weapons were bought with his own money.  They also told me that AK47 weapons were available and we had to try and refund him from state funds.  Fouche a day or two later arrived at the office with a red coloured Toyota Corolla vehicle.  This vehicle, allegedly he also got this from the so called gang members.  He went and placed the vehicle on the computer.  It was indicated that this vehicle was robbed on the 23rd March in Heidelberg, Transvaal.\n\tFouche also informed me that the gang did not only accept him as a member of the gang but he also believed that he was De Lange's brother but he did not take his appointment or weapon with him.  I was very concerned about Fouche's safety.  De Lange also then came out with a lot of other information regarding the smuggling of AK47 weapons.  My district detective officer, Swanepoel, I kept him informed about all this information which was available to me.  I also told him of the weapons which we already received by then and I was not going to go and look for the owners of the weapons because they were not reported as stolen and I thought that these people might be involved with the smuggling of the weapons.\nI also told him about the red Corolla and I told him that the gang worked with this car everyday and that was there reason why we did not take possession of this car.\n\tOne morning Elsa de Lange contacted me when I was at office and asked me to come and speak to her at her home.  Fouche accompanied me to her house.  It was in Danie Theron Street in Sasolburg.  There De Lange showed me a 765 Walter pistol and handed it over to me which she got for her own protection from one of the gang members.  I determined that this weapon was taken in an armed robbery where the weapon was stolen in kwaGuqa.  Fouche a day or two later came to me and asked me if he could take back the 765 pistol because the gang members were asking after it.  I gave him the pistol.  De Lange also gave me several other pieces of information with regards to this gang, mostly concerning weapon smuggling and armed robberies.  They also informed me that they take these weapons to Lesotho where they exchange it for diamonds and then they buy more weapons with these diamonds thus it was quite clear to me, you honour, that there was no financial gain with regards to this but it was only concerned with the distribution of firearms.  At a certain incident Fouche also told me that in the Black area of Zonkezizwe in Heidelberg they cannot just go in there but would have to give certain indications by using the lights of the vehicle or certain signs to show that there was a great amount of weapons, mainly AK47's, available within that specific Black area and that these weapons are used in order to cause political violence within the townships and also in order to arm the self defending units.\n\tHe and Elsa, at several occasions, they had to fire with these AK47's in the Black townships in order to stay in the favour of these people.  The impression I got was that they basically just fired these weapons, they didn't fire at anybody, they just fired them.  \n\tOn the 3rd April Fouche informed me that the people wanted to commit an armed robbery in Sebokeng.  Members of my unit and also of murder and robbery in Vanderbijlpark and also of the security branch in Vereenging, all of these people I brought together at the old Golden Highway close to Everton where we wanted to stop these people and arrest them.  This action continued right through the day and it was unsuccessful.  Fouche came back and said that they might want to go and rob a certain place but this also did not happen.  Nothing came of it.  Fouche asked me, that he was looking for the 635 pistol because the gang wants this weapon back.  He went to my office at Sasolburg where I agreed with him that if he arrived there he must contact me.  I spoke to him and I was worried because if he's going to hand this weapon over because there was a planned robbery according to the information he gave me.  He assured me that he would damage this weapon in order ...[intervention]",

He also said that they will rob the place at 5 o'clock the morning of the 7th.  I conveyed this information to my District Commander, Swanepoel.  Fouche also told me that he will use a vehicle, that they would steal that evening.  It would be a Honda Ballade.  However, later that evening he would come back to me to tell me if a vehicle was found.  At approximately nine o'clock I brought all the detectives together in my office who were on duty as well as Warrant Officer in charge of the dog unit, as well as members of the Internal Units who worked in Sasolburg at that stage and then I informed them regarding the information that we received.

According to the information that Fouche conveyed to me, the last of these policemen were shot the Friday evening the 3rd April.

They were contacted and came to my office to help us.  In the office it was myself, Sergeant Fouche and Lieutenant Botha of the Security Branch in Vereeniging.  Sergeant Fouche told me that during one evening in Heidelberg where they looked at weapons once again, a police official came and sold weapons to these people or wanted to buy from them and the impression that he got is that the Police and these members smuggle weapons together.\n\tWhen the Eikenhof people stopped and got out of their vehicles, Fouche identified one of the people as one of them who on the previous evening was there at Heidelberg concerning these weapon transactions and he was very worried that he would now be identified.  I realised that the situation now that Fouche's life is now in danger.  I told him to get into a cupboard in my office in order for him to hide there and then I told Warrant Officer Swanepoel of Eikenhof that we cannot continue with these actions because the informant has not yet arrived.  It was merely done because I was now aware that some of these members could possibly be involved in the smuggling of weapons.  At that stage I also had knowledge that various shotguns were gone or were stolen from the Sebokeng Municipal Police which had similar markings or was engraved in a similar fashion as the one that I knew of.  Botha confirmed that the suspect worked with them at that stage and was regularly seen with the people from Eikenhof.",

The reason why I'm saying this is that the political motive around which I saw these people, the 3 Millions were ANC Youth League people who acted alone with the ANC people in the townships.  There was also talk or information in front of this Commission about Police involvement concerning these acts and you also already found that it was politically motivated and that there was Police involvement and you have already granted amnesty to various members of these 3 Million gang.\n\tI also did an investigation after that at Tumahole neighbourhood in Parys where the so called Noxi gang was involved, that was already put to you at various other opportunities and various of those applicants were granted amnesty and it was also politically motivated and allegations were made that the Police was also involved in the provision of firearms to these people.  What I would like to mention to you now is that the modus operandi of this specific gang was similar to that of the 3 Million and the Noxi gangs.  There was also Police involvement, there was also talk of weapons that was given to Inkatha members or supplied to Inkatha members.  That's exactly what happened at the 3 Million affair and it was never argued and I accept it that the leader of the 3 Million gang was a cardholder and he came to my office or they came to my office in order to get bail for some of the members.  You will see that according to the modus operandi of these specific people it was similar to the 3 Million and Noxi gangs and I believed that these people were politically active through their acts and the arming of the groups to disrupt the government.\tTo come back to the happenings of that evening ...[intervention]",

The purpose was to arrest these people because they were dangerous and because they could have been armed with dangerous weapons.  Because of that I told the people that if they fired at us we would fire back but that none of them was to fire unless I gave the shot first or gave them the instructions to fire.  I also would like to mention that when Fouche left us this listening device was functioning, it was tested about two, three hundred metres away from us we tested it and it was still functioning fine.  Then we went to the shopping centre and the backup groups went to their different positions, posts.  Me and another ten members took up positions on the roof of the shopping centre and I believe you have photos in front of you, your honour, you'd see that it's a roof.  It's on page 51 in the second bundle page 51, 52, 53, 54. \n\tWarrant Officer Harley contacted me and told me that the vehicle stopped right across from the garage and that Fouche gave the identifiable sign and that the vehicle is moving in the direction of the shop.\n\tOnce again I asked him to give the registration number of the vehicle to people in the radio room to confirm that this vehicle was indeed a stolen vehicle and the vehicle then was confirmed by the police as being stolen the previous night.",

Sergeant Raademan said to me that they shot at a person who came around the side of the building with Fouche and after the explosion of the grenade, shot at us and they killed this person.  I asked two of the members on the roof to get down and to approach the vehicle to see if everything was safe but they did not want to climb down because of the danger.  I then asked Raademan to move towards the vehicle and to see if everything was safe.  We remained lying on the roof.  Fouche and Van der Merwe came around the corner.  I saw that Fouche was moving towards the right back side of the vehicle and he was moving in a crouched position.  I saw that he looked into the back right window of the vehicle.  I heard another shot being fired.  I saw that it was Fouche who was shooting and I gave him the instruction to stop.  We got down from the roof.  We secured the scene and I found that the two people in the vehicle were dead.  I also found that the person at the side of the shop was dead as well.  There was a fire weapon at the body of the person on the side of the shop, was a pistol, approximately two metres from the body and the person who sat at the back of the vehicle, also a weapon sticking out of the belt of his pants.  I contacted the service officer as well as Swanepoel who was the District Commander as well as the photographers, as well as the video unit.  During that period while we waited for them Constable Hammond and Raademan and Fouche asked me if they cannot go and get De Lange, to go and arrest her.  She was still waiting along the road at Taaibospruit.  They left.  Colonel Swanepoel, Captain Symington and the photographers arrived at the scene as well as the video unit.

You said that in order to succeed in your application for amnesty you must admit that you committed an offence and that this specific offence was committed with a specific political motive.  In your evidence you did not have an objective firstly, in order the killing is in an attempt to arrest them, things went wrong.  So the political objective, if you had one, would then be around the arrest.  But the arrest would not have been an offence because it is a legal arrest and that is the problem that we've got.  \t\n\tConcerning the facts that you present to us, I understand it and I see it as well, and I think that is why the advocates said that they would clear this up in their argument.  I would just like to say that from the Amnesty Committee's side that wherever they can, if they have to they will stretch towards the side of the applicant but there must be a basis for which we can do this, but I'm struggling to find it.
