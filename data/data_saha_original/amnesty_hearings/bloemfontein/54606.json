We took him to Fountain Police Station.  We took him to one of the rooms.  It was myself, Adjutant Killian, Sgt Mamone and Const Motala.  Warrant Officer questioned JJ or Pappi, why didn't he contact him again to bring information.  Pappi responded by saying he doesn't want to be an informer any more, because that put his life at risk.\n\tAfter that Warrant Officer Killian, he said Pappi should refund his money which he used to pay him as an informer.  When Pappi denied, he said we should assault him.  We assaulted him with picks and kicked him, and hit him against the wall.  Whilst we were continuing with that assault, we took a tube, we suffocated him with that. We used to take it out and put it again and continue assaulting. Every minute we put in the tube, it happened that at that time he fainted.  After he fainted, we tried to resuscitate him.  He didn't regain conscious.  They said we should bring him back with water.  We poured him with water.  When we poured him with that water, we thought he would regain conscious.  He was not able to regain conscious.  We asked Warrant Officer Killian what to do.  He said we should take him out and put him in a car.  \n\tWe took him with to Batto location.  When we arrived at Batto township, we took him between Batto location and Botshabelo location.  There is an open veld.  He said Warrant Officer Mamone and Warrant Officer Motala, should take him to the veld.  They took him to that veld.  They just dropped him there. I heard a gun shot.  Then they returned.    They informed Warrant Officer Killian that that person in the cupboard, so they finished him off.  Then we went.\n\tIn the morning when we reported at work, the policeman from Batt location phoned us.  They phoned Warrant Officer Tzwamitze.  He said myself and Motalo should accompany them to the location.  When we arrived there, a certain sergeant or warrant-officer, I don't remember his rank, is Tobihi - his name is Modisa, I don't know if Modise is the surname or a name, whether his surname Tobihi or Modise, I don't remember well.   He said there is a person who was wearing a UDF T-shirt who was found in the veld, we should try to explain to him who is that person. Warrant Officer Tzwamitze said he doesn't know that person.  Myself and Mamone were able to recognise that that was the person we assaulted yesterday.  Then we left Batto township.  We returned to our office.  \n\tThe explanation we want to give:  during the period of torture Motsamai was in the office, but he didn't take part in the assault, because he was busy with other detainees in the office.",

We have met the counsel and lawyers and we have discovered in the second application, there are more offences that have been raised therein, which implicate more people, which there are more victims as well included in that second statement.  I think we would need some time to make further investigations and also time to inform the victims and the implicated persons who have been implicated in that second statement, and we have agreed that it would be better to postpone the matter and that set it for a week, because ...",

            "We will have a hearing for a week, yes.  Does everyone agree with that?  I think it should be made clear that it has emerged that the document referred to by Mr Ngo's counsel, was completed by him and notification of its existence was sent to the Amnesty Committee in Cape Town and from the letter available, it was for the Prisons Department then to forward it, that any delay was not as a result of delay by the applicant.  He had completed this second document which has now been handed in to us, and which we have numbered.  There two annexures to it, A1 to 13 and the second one was already numbered B1 to 22 or 27, I think.  Those are now available and they were made available by the applicant timeously.  So we think it only right that he should be given every opportunity to investigate the matter that is set out there.  But we agree entirely with what has been said by Ms Thabetha, the matter should now in our view, that the new documents should be referred to the investigative unit, for them to make contact or verify the facts, to make contact with the victims and with interested parties, parties named, and it is our view that that should be done immediately.  It should not be waited till a day a hearing has been fixed and go along and tell them it is going to happen in three weeks time.  Contact should be made now so a complete investigation can be made.  The applicant in certain of these applications have even given a telephone number of possible victims.  I feel quite sure that the applicant will co-operate with the investigative unit, if he is able to assist in giving further details of where these people can be found.  That is so, is it not?",

            "And that should be done immediately, and then once that has been done, it seems to me, subject to what counsel may have to say, that it might be desirable in the circumstances of this case, to have something in the nature of a pre-trial conference presided over by one of the members of the Committee, where agreement could be reached as to the admissibility and otherwise of documents, as to the necessity for calling certain evidence, as to whether admissions can be made.  So that when the hearing commences again, it can continue uninterruptedly.  I do not want to make it sound as if I am blaming counsel for what has happened this time, there was obviously an unfortunate misunderstanding.  The document that was referred to at the last hearing, went amiss and copies were not made available as they should have.  As a result of which notice has not been given as required.  So we agree with the proposition that the matter should be adjourned to a date to be arranged and recommend that on that occasion it should be set down for the beginning of a week and no other matters should be set down for that week.  But before the date is arranged, I would request that contact be made with all the interested parties to ascertain the date is convenient to all of them.  And it should be done well in advance, because by that time the Committee may have increased in size, we may be spread all over the place, it may be more difficult to reconvene the same three members. So we need a little time to organise that.  So subject to that, I agree that the matter now be adjourned to a date to be arranged.",
