We have managed to locate the docket in the matter in which Mr White Mohapi laid a charge of assault and attempted murder and robbery with the South African Police.\n\tWe are busy arranging for photocopies to be made of the docket to be handed to both the members of the Committee and also to my learned friends.  I've gone through this docket last night and I submit Mr Chairman, that there are material aspects which arise from the reading of the docket, and in fairness we believe that Mr Mohapi should have the opportunity to deal with any such differences as there may exist between his evidence and that which emerges from the docket. \n\tWe've mentioned to Mr Stander that we are busy making the photocopies and we'll hand it to him so that he can have a loot at it beforehand but we've asked him that in case you think it is fit so so, that he should attempt to arrange for Mr Mohape to attend either tomorrow or whenever so that his cross-examination may be re-opened and these questions may be put to him.",

Are we going to come across certain statements which would have been allegedly been made by Mr Mohpi which he would then say: \"I didn't say that, the people who took those statements might have been collaborting with the security branch, I never said that\".\n\tAnd are we then thereafter going to have to call those people who would supposedly have taken statements from him, to come and say: \"Well, this is what he said\" and so on and so forth.  I'm getting worried that this matter is - we'll have to consider it very carefully Mr Visser.  We appreciate that you raise that point, you came across the docket.  \t\n\tBut I think for a start, you should discuss the matter - and this is my personal opinion, discuss the matter with Mr Stander with regard in particular to some of the issues that I have raised.  If we are going to end up opening a totally new front altogether, I would have serious misgivings about that.  It seems to us that we must restrict ourselves, certainly within the perimeter of what we are here for.  \n\tAnd I think that, speaking for myself, you will need to discuss with Mr Stander, to make sure that we are not going to open a totally new front and in the end finding ourselves embarking on virtually a trial within a trial.",
