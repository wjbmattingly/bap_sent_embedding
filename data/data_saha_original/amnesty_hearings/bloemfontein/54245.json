It was known in that area that he was selling tobacco and I arrived there pretending to be someone going to buy tobacco, but I had a knife with me.  I knew that the knife would not disturb me in any way and I would use it.  It was quite a silent way of doing things.  People would not even hear that something was going on at Odendaal's.  Now this man was in the kraal and he saw us and he came out, he came to approach us.  I was together with Jabulani Shabalala.  When he arrived, I made as if I was taking out money and I noticed that I had to finish with the job immediately and I stabbed him three times.  He tried to fight, but he ended up dying and I asked Jabulani as to where the key of the safe was.  He showed me and he said:  \"Search him on the back pockets\".  That's where I found a knife, I'm sorry, not a knife but a key.  I found - there were two keys, it looked like two keys were those of a safe and the rest, I did not take a good look at them.  I went with Jabulani inside.  He was going to show me the place as he explained.  It's true I was behind him and he showed me where the safe was.  He said - he knew two safes in other words.  Now this one that we opened, we found firearms inside, these pump guns, many of them, really, but by the look of things, when I left this house, I noticed that they would be visible, we would not be able to hide them because I was walking, I did not have any mode of transport.\n\tI wanted then to go and look in the other safe and I also noticed that we had spent too much time inside already because the purpose was to wait outside and sort-of keep guard.  So he went out when I asked him to go out and when he went out he saw Anna Magwa getting into another farmhouse.  In other words she was running and this made him suspicious that she might have saw something.  He came to me, he said:  \"The girl who is working here\", that was Anna Magwa, \"is getting into that farmhouse there, she might have seen something.\"  And I said to him:  \"We have to leave, that is the best thing, before his sons come and get us.\"  He asked me:  \"Don't we take anything?  Don't we take one or two firearms?\" and I made him aware:  \"People are watching at us and we are going to be seen right on that we are the people who committed this act.\"  I took one pump gun and I jumped the fence and I felt no, I would not have a chance to run carrying this because I was running in the field and I left this firearm close to the fence and we ran away towards the tarred road leading to Qwaqwa, that's where the police arrested us.
