<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   You assisted in extending the tables for Counsel and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>providing further microphones for their use, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>	We are now proceeding to hear the application of Mpezele Nelson Ngo, </p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>applicant No 2422/96.  The Committee consists of the same three persons </p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>Wilson, Ngoepe, De Jager.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>MS THABETHA:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Chair I don't know, I think we </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>should clarify, Mr Motsomai is sitting over there with the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Is he also, I thought you're not ready to hear that. Are you </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>ready to hear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>MS THABETHA:   That's what I wanted to clarify, that maybe he should, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>needn't sit here necessarily because ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   I understood that its  going to be arranged that we're going </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>to hear Ngo only and that he would join tomorrow and he's ...(indistinct) his </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>application. Is that ...(indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>MS THABETHA:   Yes very well, I'm indebted to the Committee members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Mr Chairperson I think I also need to be clarified.  What </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>does it mean when the Committee says that it's going to hear matters </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>simultaneously in practical terms? </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   It means as provided in the Act that it is going to hear </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>evidence which relates to different applications together.  We are not going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>duplicate these things, we are going to hear the applications.  They remain </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>separate applications brought by each individual, there is no such thing as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>joint application.  They are separate applications which are heard together. That </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>is the evidence led is evidence in both or all of the applications, in so far as it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>relevant to that application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>ADV MEMANI:  Doesn't it mean then that the applicants must then be there </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>together at all times, that when we're finished does it mean that when Mr Ngo </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>finishes to testify he's going to testify or does it mean that when Mr Ngo </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>finishes testifying then the police witnesses are going to testify?  I'm at a </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>complete loss now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   We would have the police witnesses that relate only to </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>Ngo.  Those that relate to both of them would give evidence after they have </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>both given evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>ADV MEMANI:  In that even then we are not hearing Mr Motsamai then, </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>we're hearing Ngo alone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Today yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>ADV MEMANI:  Then may Mr Motsomai be excused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   That's what I suggested that he remove himself from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>table and go and sit elsewhere, down in the body of the hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>ADV MEMANI:  As the Chair pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Where he can hear the evidence of Mr Ngo because it </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>may well be, and certainly is, that part of that will relate to him.  It may be more </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>if he remained sitting here where he can hear it easily. If you wish we could </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>start both applications now, it was you as I understood who said that there were </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>various reasons why we couldn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Yes but then I understood that pressure was put upon me to </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>proceed with these applications no matter what, but the only reason why we </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>could proceed was that the only relevance is that the only evidence that would </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>be led this afternoon is that of Mr Ngo.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   No I can't hear you, speak up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>ADV MEMANI:   My understanding was that they are going to be heard </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>simultaneously, that is together whilst they are sitting there but we will be </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>hearing the evidence of Ngo only today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Yes but that evidence may well relate to your other client. </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a> Ngo isn't to be asked to give evidence again.  The whole purpose of hearing </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>applications together is to avoid the repetition of evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>ADV MEMANI:  I think Mr Chair should say that you are more comfortable </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>with them sitting there together and they will just proceed as they are sitting </p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>there together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Very well we'll hear both the applications, we will hear </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>then the application I have already given you details of and the application of </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>Mohanaetsi Stephen Motsamai applicant No 4031/96.  These applications are </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>being heard together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>MS THABETHA:   Mr Chair I would like to hand over to Mr Willem Brits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>MR BRITS:   Thank you Mr Chairman, my involvement only relates in so far </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>as the application of Ngo.  The implicated persons there who I represent is </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>Colonel Flip Loots and Sergeant Hendrik Bukawa.  Now I've drafted affidavits </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>in which they state their version of the facts where they were implicated, I've </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>handed copies of these affidavits to my learned friends here and specifically to </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>the legal representatives of the applicant, they've gone and worked through it, </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>they said that we can hand it in by agreement, we can hand it in but they are not </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>waiving the right to cross examination but at this stage it doesn't necessary that </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>there are so many material facts pertained in these affidavits that they want my </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>clients to be present at the moment.  I am available and I beg leave to hand </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>original copies of these affidavits to the Committee, and these implicated </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>persons do not oppose the application of Mr Ngo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Very well, they will be, Loots will be A and Mukaba B.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>Is it necessary for us to read these?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>MR BRITS:   Not at this stage Mr Chairman.  If needed later ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   One would certainly read them later, I ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>MR BRITS:   Ja but for cross examination, maybe for record purposes, then we </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>can...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   ...(indistinct) difference will be made to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>pattern...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>MR BRITS:   And as such I may at this stage be excused from proceedings.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>I've made arrangements with them where they can contact me if necessary but </p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>practically it doesn't look like they're going to need my clients within this </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>...(indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Okay we will excuse them till further notice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>MR BRITS:   Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>ADV MEMANI:  Mr Chairperson may I put it on record that Mr Mthembu and </p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>I do not accept responsibly for notifying him of any postponements or calling </p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>him and this is a matter which is within the ...(indistinct) of the functions of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>MS THABETHA:   Members of the Committee, before we proceed with Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>Ngo's evidence, I would like Advocate Memani to certify how he is going to go </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>about addressing his evidence because as far as I know Mr Ngo has applied for </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>eight acts which he is committed.  So I would like to have some clarification on </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>Advocate Memani. </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>ADV MEMANI:  Mr Chairperson, when we concluded these </p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>proceedings...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Sorry this is, you say he's applied for eight.  And where is </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>this list to be found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   That's the first that you have advised us that you prepared </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>something that could assist the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>MR WAGENAAR:   Mr Chairman indeed I have, the only hesitation I have at </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>the moment is that I would have to hand in more than one of the pieces of work </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>that I've prepared for it to make sense.  I must just inform the Committee with </p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>respect at this stage, that because we're not involved in the Pretoria incidents </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>they have not been included in what we have prepared but subject to that </p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>qualification we gladly hand it to you Mr Chairman.  If you will give me a </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>moment's time, Mr Chairman may we first hand in Exhibit P30, you don't have </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>to concern yourself about marking the exhibits, we are keeping the exhibit list </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>numbers up to date and we will hand that to you as well. So we might hand to </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>you Exhibit P30 and I'll give you a short word of explanation on that so that </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>you can understand, with respect, how the document is intended to work Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>	Mr Chairman looking at Exhibit 30 you will see that it consists of five </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>pages, actually six but the last one is just in case a member of the Committee </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>wishes to fill in any other information which I couldn't think about.  Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>Chairman the list approaches the matters of both Mr Motsamai and Mr Ngo on </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>all the documentation that was placed before the Committee and it approaches </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>the matter from the point of view of incidents.  Now I'm going to hand to you a </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>further exhibit, P31 in a moment which approaches the matter from the point of </p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>view of persons indicated so that you have the best of both worlds we hope Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>Chairman to assist you in the summary of what we attempted to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>	What we have attempted to do Mr Chairman is because Mr Motsamai </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>has produced three documents, perhaps you know about them, if you don't, </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>may I quickly inform you what they are.  The first is his application form, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>then at the last hearing on the 14th of March a document was produced which </p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>was a hand-written document, the status of which we are not certain of Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>Chairman.  That was handed in as Exhibit P28.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Is my learned friend referring to Mr Motsamai or Mr Ngo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>MR WAGENAAR:   I'm referring to Mr Motsamai.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>ADV MEMANI:   I'm sorry but we haven't heard Mr Motsamai yet, nor have </p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>any documents been submitted on behalf of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Motsamai, let me just see what I have got, I've got his </p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>MR WAGENAAR:   The document produced by the official of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>Committee Mr Chairman on the 24th of March when we were here last time.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>It's a hand written document, we've included it here Mr Chairman, we don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>know what the statement of that document is but reference to certain incidents </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>were made in that document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   What does it look like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>MR WAGENAAR:   It's this one Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>MS THABETHA:   It's the handwritten statement, you've got it annexed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Mr Chairman, why don't we proceed with the evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>and go and deal with these matters at the most appropriate stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>MR WAGENAAR:   Mr Chairman it is the one that looks like this, it's the </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>handwritten statement that looks like this.  It's under a covering...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   It's headed Brief Description of the Violation of Human </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>Rights.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>MR WAGENAAR:   Well mine says, Details of the Person Making Statement </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>and then it goes on to say, exactly, Brief Description.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Mine Starts off saying, Declaration.  I Mahonaetsi </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>Motsomatsi solemnly declare the information I'm about to give is correct.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>next page is, Details of Person Making  Statement and the next is, Brief </p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>Description of the Violation of Human Rights, and then are then two additional </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>pages.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>MR WAGENAAR:   You will forgive us Mr Chairperson, we don't have the </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>first page which you referred to but that is the documentation which was </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>handed in as Exhibit P28 at the last hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   P28?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>MR WAGENAAR:   P28.  We are not addressing at all the merits of what we </p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>are referring to, we're simply taking you through the document, exhibit P30 to </p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>explain to you how it's supposed to work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>	Mr Chairman and then last week another document was produced by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>Committee which was forwarded to us and there's a document marked </p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>Annexure B.  You will certainly see it at some stage or another if you haven't </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>got it already.  The reason why I mention that Mr Chairman is merely for this </p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>purpose, to show you that Miss Motsamai has placed three documents before </p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>you apparently, we also don't know what the status of Annexure B is, we will </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>have certain submissions later, but what we've done Mr Chairman is from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>point of view of incidents, we have over the five pages before you dealt with </p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>every incident which was mentioned in the application form in the first column, </p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>in Exhibit P28 in the second column and in Annexure B in the third column, </p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>and then simultaneously Mr Chairman, in the last column we dealt with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>evidence on the application form and the annexure thereto of Mr Ngo. So that </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>the purpose is this, Mr Chairman, you could at a glance, see what incidents </p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>have been referred to by both these applicants, where they were referred to and </p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>in a sense, to a certain extent, how they either agree with each other or how </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>they conflict with each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>	That's the only purpose of Exhibit P30 is to give you a working </p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>document if it's of any assistance to you.  We don't hand it in for purposes of </p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>proof of the contents thereof, it's simply a working document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>	Mr Chairman may I then refer you to another...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Everybody else has seen this have they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>MR WAGENAAR:   Yes they have.  Mr Chairman I have also drawn, if you </p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>regard the contents of that, 31, I'm sorry 31, the contents of that as of doubtful </p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>assistance to you, well then of course you are free to ignore it but the purpose </p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>of this document was to approach the evidence of both Mr Ngo and Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>Motsomai from a point of view of the perpetrators Mr Chairman, so that when </p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>you deliberate on the issues at the end of the day, we felt Mr Chairman that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>would have a summary from both points of view and we hope that that will be </p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>of assistance, not only to you but also to our learned friend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>	While I have the floor so to speak Mr Chairman and perhaps to continue </p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>with a few other household matters, at the last occasion when we adjourned we </p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>gave an undertaking that we would attempt to find the personal file on Mr Ngo. </p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a> We are told Mr Chairman that there are more than one file but we've been able </p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>to locate one of them.  That file has been gone through by myself and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>documents which may be of interest to the Committee from the point of view of </p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>its enquiries, I have photocopied Mr Chairman and I place them before you.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>You are welcome to go through the file of course yourself, it's a fairly bulky </p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>file, and my learned friend is also of course very welcome to do so.  I couldn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>find any documents other than the ones which we've got before you now, which </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>we'll hand to you now, which are vaguely relevant to your enquiry Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>Chairman, and perhaps we could hand that up for your assistance as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>	What we've done Mr Chairman, because it deals with the same issue as </p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>did Exhibit P27 at the last hearing, we have numbered them P27.1/2/11 so that </p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>they're all in the same area in your exhibit file Mr Chairman perhaps lastly as I </p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>promised, we have drafted just for you to know where we are more or less, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>have drafted an update on the exhibit list numbers which we also hand to you </p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>Mr Chairman.  And then very lastly Mr Chairman, there was some, perhaps </p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>criticism is a strong word, but there were some doubts expressed by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>honourable Committee members at the last hearing about a computer print out </p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>reflecting as is purported to do the leave of Mr Erasmus. What we've been able </p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>to do is to find an additional document which we beg leave to hand in under </p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>cover of an affidavit which actually sets out an extract from his leave file Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>Chairman...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   That was P26 wasn't it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>MR WAGENAAR:   Correct Mr Chairman, and we suggest that we mark this </p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>one P26 too to have it all together.  And with that Mr Chairman I have nothing </p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>further to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Well wait, wait, I'm coming with more queries. Other </p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>members of the Committee may have similar ones. I do not seem to have all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>Exhibits listed on your list.  Now I don't know whether copies were made </p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>available of all these documents or whether they were merely one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>MR WAGENAAR:  Mr Chairman there are two answers to your question.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>The first is you must bear in mind perhaps wisely or unwisely at the hearings in </p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>Pretoria we suggested and the then Chairman His Lordship Mr Justice Mall </p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>accepted that it might be an idea to hand in all the exhibits emanating from </p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>clients of Wagner, Miller and du Plessis as a P exhibit, P to 1 500, so what you </p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>have before you is a list of exhibits which don't only cover Ngo's case and </p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>Motsamai's case obviously but it contains the full list.  Now it may have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>wise or unwise but that's part of the answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>	The rest of the answer to your query Mr Chairman is that whenever we </p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>handed up documents it was always done with copies at all times.  Now if you </p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>would give an indication of which exhibits you miss, we will make certain that </p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>you have copies presented to you to replace the ones that are missing from your </p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>file.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Well perhaps rather than wasting time now </p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>MR WAGENAAR:   We'll do it during the night and will have it tomorrow </p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Thank you, we will consult with one another as to </p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>whether any of us have or who has or has not and let you know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>MR WAGENAAR:   Perhaps after the adjournment we could wait and receive </p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>your instructions as to what ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Yes if we adjourn and you could come and speak for a </p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>few minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>MR WAGENAAR:   Certainly Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Have you got all these exhibits?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>MS THABETHA:   Yes Mr Chair I do. Only exhibits is so far as the matter </p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>Ngo and Motsamai are concerned. I know that I've got more copies for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>affidavits ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   No the affidavits we haven't had yet are the P32 to 41.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>MR WAGENAAR:  Perhaps we could hand them in straight away and </p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   No but I shouldn't have them yet, that's all, they're not </p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>missing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>MR WAGENAAR:   Mr Motsomai's application hasn't...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   The list goes up to 31.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>MR WAGENAAR:   Yes. We'll try to sort it out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>MS THABETHA:   Mr Chair before we proceed, may I just highlight it to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>Committee members that between the application of Mr Motsamai and Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>Ngo, there are two matters which seem to be related to the same offences, </p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>namely the burning of Winnie Mandela's clinic and the bombing of Jannue </p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>Mohape's Ford Cortina and Elia Mohape's minibus.  It's just those two which </p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>are related to each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Let's look at these. the burning of the clinic, the burning of </p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>the Ford Cortina, I'm not sure what compare be means, petrol bombing of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>house of Max Mokuba and the murder of Oupa Makhubalo. So how many, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>say there are two, those two, the burning of the house and the car, and then </p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>there's the further mention of the attack of the attack on Oupa Makhubalo or </p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>attacks, matter No 13 under Motsamai, and next to it appears the letters </p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>compare B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a>MR WAGENAAR:   If I may explain, I don't want to confuse you but the </p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>reason why that is inserted there is merely because that is the only place where </p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>Mr Ngo refers to Makhubalo, but he doesn't refer to an attempted murder on </p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>...(indistinct), only the attack on his home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   The same person though.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>MR WAGENAAR:   Yes it's the same person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Well perhaps we'll get to hearing the evidence that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>have come for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>MS THABETHA:   I will now hand over to Advocate Memani to lead Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>Ngo.  Thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Thank you Mr Chair, now Mr ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Are you going to call him now to give evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>MPEZELE NELSON NGO:      (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now Mr Ngo at the previous hearing you testified about the </p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>incident relating to the death of Mr Venter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>MR NGO:   That's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now Mr Chair at this stage I would like to make a request </p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a>to refer to some aspects on his evidence at that stage.  Mr Chair do I have your </p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>leave to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now on the last occasion you told us that your brothers </p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>John and Arrie Ngo assisted you in what amounted to reburial of Mr Venter? Is </p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>MR NGO:   That's true.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now you also told us that you had told them that Mr Venter </p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>had been found in an accident and had been buried there.  Do you remember </p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>MR NGO:   Yes that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now do you wish to add anything about the involvement of </p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>your brothers in the incident relating to Mr Venter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>MR NGO:  They helped me to bury him there, that is the only thing that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>did because we requested their help.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>ADV MEMANI:   The question which arose is why did you prefer to use your </p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>brothers when you had informers who were available to you, why did you </p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>prefer them who were on your evidence some kind of a risk to the Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>MR NGO:   The explanation I gave is that they firstly knew the area well </p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>which was a municipal area where we buried Venter.  We used to use them </p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>because I trusted him, those were the people whom we used for information, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>used to tell me things that I trusted that even if I told him that he should do that </p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>kind of a thing, he'll be on my side.  I recruited him in other words in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>Security Branch about to be an information source.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now it is the first time that you're telling the Committee that </p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>your brothers had been your information sources and that you used them </p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>precisely because they were your sources and you trusted them.  Why didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a>you tell the Committee on the previous occasion that they were your sources </p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>and you trusted them because of that reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>MR NGO:   The reason was that I was answering because in terms of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>questions asked and I am answering now because of the question asked and </p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a>those are the things which I was prepared to say because it was in line with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a> ADV MEMANI:   Now Mr Ngo the question about the wire that was found </p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>on the neck Mr Venter do you have you anything to say regarding how it came </p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>about that there was a wire around his neck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>MR NGO:   It happened that I arrived there then I shot Mr Venter. After that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>tied his hands with wire, then I went back after to the car after I had tied his </p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>hands and his feet. After that when I arrived at the car, Adjutant Ramasweu </p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>made a decision that we should go and fetch the body.  When we arrived in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>house we found Mr Venter while he was sleeping on the mattresses, he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>bleeding, we were supposed to pick him up and take him out of the house. We </p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a>saw that just to take him there there will be some blood stains on the ground.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>That is why I put a pillow case on his head, then I tied that pillow case on his </p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>neck so that he should not bleed and we should not have blood stains on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>ground.  That is how the wire was there on his neck. We were awaiting blood </p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>stains on the floor and on the ground whilst we were taking him to the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now in the Judgement, I beg Mr Chair's pardon, I haven't </p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>made a note of where it appears on the record, but there is some reference to </p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>the fact that there was no blood found at the house of Mr Venter and that </p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>makes it improbable that Mr Venter would have been shot in that house </p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>because the doctor said that if Mr Venter had been shot in his house, then he or </p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a>she would have expected to find blood to be found by the police on the scene, </p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>because he would have bled profusely. Do you have any comment as to why </p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>there was no blood found there if you shot him inside the house?  That if Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>Venter had been shot in the house as described by Mr Ngo, he or she would </p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>have expected blood to be found on the scene because a person shot in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a>manner described by Mr Ngo would have bled profusely.  The Police testified </p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>that there was no blood found on the scene.  The learned judge then in his </p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>judgement made a finding that it is improbable that Mr Venter was shot in his </p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a>house in the light of the evidence given by the doctor and the police.  I am now </p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a>asking Mr Ngo to tell us why no blood was found in the house of Mr Venter.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a>have been told that it's page 32 line 20 of the judgement My Lord.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>	Now we are waiting for the answer from Mr Ngo I suppose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>MR NGO:   I didn't quite understand your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>ADV MEMANI:   At the trial the Doctor testified, let me start with the police, </p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>the police testified that when they arrived at Mr Venter's house there was no </p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a>blood on the floor and the Doctor testified that if Mr Venter had been shot in </p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>his house in the manner in which it's described and had suffered the wounds </p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>that he suffered, he would have bled profusely and he would have expected the </p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>police to find blood on the scene.  The presiding judge then in his judgement </p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a>remarked that if you were telling the truth then you would have expected in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>light of what he's been told by his doctor and the police that blood should be </p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>found on the scene.  Now I'm asking you to tell the Committee why no blood </p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>was found on the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a>MR NGO:   Where I shot him it was in the sitting room. There were sofas </p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>there, there were carpets just next to every sofa.  They were round and they </p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>were put in front of the sofa, so after I shot him he fell on one of the carpets </p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>which were there. When we returned I found him lying on one of the carpets, </p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a>he was bleeding.  I did not take a long time before I came back.  I ran fast from </p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>the car to the house, where he fell he fell on one of the carpets, he was not on </p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>the mats on the mats which were fixed on the floor.  We took him together with </p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>the carpets and took him outside.  The blood which was there was on the carpet </p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>which we took together with the body, where he fell, so we took him together </p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>with that carpet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Cupboard or carpet? Carpet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now another aspect Mr Ngo is the question of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a>testimony at the court...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Sorry before you go on, can I ask him something about </p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>this.  Is the only blood stained you removed the carpet that his head was lying </p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a>on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>MR NGO:   He fell on the floor mat so we rolled that mat on his body, so we </p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a>took him together with that floor mat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Is that the only trace of blood you removed from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>room, you didn't clean up the room in any other way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a>MR NGO:   He fell on that floor mat, his head fell on that floor mat which was </p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a>on top of the carpet, so I took the pillow and covered his head and took him </p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>together with that floor mat but I did not see any other blood stains on the floor </p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a>or somewhere else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   He was standing was he when you shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>MR NGO:   He was reading a paper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Because you see the doctor also said there would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a>been spots of blood caused by the impact of the bullet and no such spots were </p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>found.  Can you explain that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>ADV MEMANI:   At which page are we My Lord.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Page 32 line 20. </p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>	Volgens Professor Olivier sal daar sekerlik ..there would definitely </p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>have been spots with the shot being fired. If the body of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a>deceased had stayed in one place and after that he would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>expected that there would have been quite some blood under the </p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>Can you explain why there weren't spots of blood elsewhere caused by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>impact of the bullet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>MR NGO:   I'm not able to explain that as to why there were no blood stains </p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>somewhere else because I was not looking.  What I did is that I shot him.  After </p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>shooting him he fell, he wanted to lean forward but at the time when I shot him </p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a>I pressed him down and then I tied him on the hands and feet.  Whether there </p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>was no blood elsewhere I'm not able to testify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Is it correct Mr Ngo that the furniture that was in the house </p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>was also removed in the room where Mr Venter was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>MR NGO:   That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Did you inspect that furniture to see if it had blood stains on </p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>it or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>MR NGO:   I didn't have an opportunity to inspect the furniture on my own.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>don't know of people who remained with the furniture in But...(indistinct), that's </p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a>why they did inspect, that's where there were blood stains.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>ADV MEMANI:   A question which seemed to arise again was why, when you </p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>had already seen that the police were not helping you after you had killed Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a>Venter, did you then not choose to tell the truth and say that 'I was sent by </p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>Coetzee and Erasmus to do this thing' and chose to implicate your brothers </p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>instead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>MR NGO:   They didn't say to me they are helping me and they did help me.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>They used to bring money to me in prison and at the same time they helped me </p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>to escape from prison. </p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>ADV MEMANI:   And in court, why did you chose to implicate your brothers </p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>and say that they were responsible for the killing of Mr Venter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a>MR NGO:   As I explained, in court I gave evidence in fact hoping that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a>will do all means that I should not be imprisoned.  As they did promise me that </p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a>they will make it possible for me to escape from prison, so I trusted them </p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a>because there were many things which they were able to do for you as </p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a>members of the Security Branch that they would negotiate with the prison </p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a>officials for my escape so that they would arrange with other prison officials </p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a>that I should escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Mr Ngo, your counsel is taking you back to  questions </p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>which you were asked and which you answered, which area he did not traverse </p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a>or did traverse during the opportunity he was given to reexamine, which </p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a>reexamination he did carry out.  Now do you remember the answers you gave </p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a>to this same question which was asked you last time, do you remember what </p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a>answer you gave as to why you incriminated your brothers during the trial, for </p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a>example?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a>MR NGO:   Do you mean in which way did they help me to bury the body or </p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a>to give evidence, I don't understand the question correctly Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:  I'm not talking about the police, I'm asking you, do you </p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a>remember that the same question was asked of you last time and do you </p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a>remember the answer you gave last time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a>MR NGO:   To say that my brothers should help me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE: Why you incriminated your our brothers and risked them </p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a>going to jail or being sentenced to death and not spill the beans?  Do you </p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a>remember the answer you gave last time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a>MR NGO:   Yes I do remember Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   What did you say last time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a>MR NGO:   I said I, one of my brothers was used as a state witness against me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Well is it the same answer that you have just given a few </p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a>minutes ago?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a>MR NGO:   I didn't understand the question asked by Mr Memani, that is why </p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a>I said the question should be repeated, because I didn't understand that question </p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a>in which way it was going or what kind of answer it needed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Well why did you answer it if you didn't understand it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>MR NGO:   I answered then he answered again, then I said I didn't understand. </p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a> That is why you came in and you said, 'do you remember the evidence you </p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a>gave in regard to the question', that is then that I didn't understand as to whether </p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a>do you mean what kind of evidence you are asking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   I advise you now that if your counsel goes back to asking </p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a>you questions which were asked and which you answered last time, you must </p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a>please try to remember the answers you gave last time because two questions </p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a>have been repeated here, both in respect of which you gave two answers which </p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a>you didn't give last time and it seems to me if you go on like this, if you don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a>try very hard to remember the answers you gave last time we will keep on </p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a>getting different answers, answers that were different, which are different to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a>answers you gave to exactly the same questions last time.  You may be advised </p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>to try and think very hard if your counsel goes back to the same questions you </p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a>were asked last time, my advice to you is that please try to think very hard </p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>about the answers you gave last time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   That is if those answers were true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a>MR NGO:   I understand Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now you've told us that you hoped that the police would </p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a>help you and they did help you by arranging an escape for you for instance and </p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a>they came and gave you money.  Now you have also confirmed that on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a>previous occasion you said that you testified against your brother because he </p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a>was being used as a state witness against you.  Now when you say that he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a>used as a state witness against you, let me say why do you say that he was used </p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>as a state witness against you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Because he testified for the State. What other reason could </p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a>there be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Mr Chairperson may the witness answer the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   If you want to repeat all the questions you've put last time, </p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a>repeat all those questions, you could do so Mr Memani but you'll have to face </p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a>the consequences then. </p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Mr Chairperson I'm not going to repeat all the questions, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>these are matters which I feel should be clarified because there is some </p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a>difficulty around them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   Mr Memani I think that I did not want to put it as strongly </p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a>as one of my colleagues, perhaps properly put, but you see you are going back </p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a>to the same thing and we traversed this area and he came at some stages up </p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a>with a version that he incriminated his brother because his brother had sought </p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a>to incriminate him. It was pointed out to him that he was Accused No 1, he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a>the first one to testify, even before any of his brothers could testify and he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a>the first person to start incriminating his brothers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>ADV MEMANI:   That is correct My Lord but there is something that I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a>trying to lead him on on this aspect</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   I don't know, I'm speaking for myself, I really wouldn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a>have allowed you to go back to this because questions were put to him, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a>answered  and then you reexamined him and you go back to the same </p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a>questions, now we, I'm not sure that we're getting a new version altogether </p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a>which will require  of the other people now to come and reexamine him.  I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a>reservations about this.  You are lucky that the Chairperson allowed you to do </p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a>that but perhaps don't push your luck too far Mr Memani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Was his brother a state witness at the trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Mr Chairperson he was not a state witness as lawyers </p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a>would understand it and that is why I'm asking him to clarify that matter, why </p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a>does he say that he was used as a state witness when he was in fact testifying </p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a>as a coaccused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Carry on.  Did your brother give evidence after you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a>MR NGO:   Yes he gave evidence after me. </p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   So when you gave evidence he had not said anything to </p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a>the court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a>MR NGO:   Yes that's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now Mr Ngo, why do you say that he was a state witness? </p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a>at the court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a>MR NGO:   I took it that he was a state witness because he was telling how the </p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a>police took him to the Bri...(indistinct) and then bribed him and he was taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a>out of us and taken somewhere, then they were protected by the police, </p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a>therefore in that regard I took him as the state witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Mr Ngo you are a policeman. You know what a state </p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a>witness is, surely. You were aware that this person was charged with you as </p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a>accused No 2.  You know what a state witness is, you are a policeman but how </p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a>can you come and say to us that your brother was a state witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a>MR NGO:   If people are coaccused and arrested together, the reason for them </p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a>to separate them into various cells and then at night you take him to other </p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a>places, you make him change his clouds and you know that he is dressing now </p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a>with new clothes from home and is now accompanying the police. So I came to </p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a>a conviction that he is now working in cahoots with the police, so that they are </p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a>creating an opportunity that he should tell the court what they want him to do. </p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a>That is why I understood that he was made a state witness.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   But you know state witnesses are not charged, they are </p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a>given indemnity from prosecution, aren't they.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   It is possible that you can make a person a state witness </p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a>so that you, even if you're not a state witness but though you are an accused, </p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a>you can testify differently that even if he's your coaccused he will get 20 years </p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a>and then he will get 18 months because you have made him a state witness so </p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a>that you will be able to lighten his sentence to protect that it should be clear that </p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a>he is a state witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Anything else that you want to ask him about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a>ADV MEMANI:   No more My Lord. Now I'm indebted to his Lordship for </p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a>this opportunity I am now going to proceed to the other acts My Lord. </p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a>	Now Mr Ngo I want to refer you to your application, the one which is in </p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a>the manuscript.  Mr Chairperson I recall that at the last hearing you asked Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a>Mpshe to make copies of what was referred to as the second application.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a>don't know if those copies were made and are if front of you at this stage.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a>MR VAN DER MERWE:   Mr Chairman with respect, your ruling on that </p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a>matter was that that one was going to be ignored for purposes of this </p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a>application, that was the ruling as far if I remember correctly.  We don't have a </p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a>copy of it and I'm not certain whether it's relevant to bring it up now. </p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   I don't have a copy before me at the present time, nor have </p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a>any of the other Committee members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a>ADV MEMANI:   But I do recall Mr Chairman that although that initially you </p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a>had adopted the stance that it was that it was not relevant, at some stage it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a>brought before the committee and some arrangement was made that copies </p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a>should be made in due course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Well that does not seem to have been done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now Mr Chairman, that being the case then, I will proceed </p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a>without referring to pages because we don't have the same papers in front of us. </p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a>In your application you confess to an act of kidnapping a COSAS secretary and </p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a>you seek amnesty in respect of that conduct, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a>MR NGO:   That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now can you tell this Committee about this incident? When </p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a>did the incident take place.  Let me start here, what was the name of the person </p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>that was involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a>MR NGO:   That is White Mohape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a>ADV MEMANI:   When did the abduction or kidnapping of Mr Mohape </p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a>occur?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a>MR NGO:   That's 1986 Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Do you recall the specific date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a>MR NGO:   No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  ...(indistinct)  records circumstances, this incident is </p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>referred to on page 5 of the annexure to his application, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a>MS THABETHA:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now may I add that our numbering is not the same because </p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a>of the fact that I'm using the, what is referred to as the Second Application Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a>Chairperson.  Now Mr Ngo, can you tell the Committee the circumstances </p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a>surrounding the kidnap of Mr Mohape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a>MR NGO:   It happened that Mohape was an influential leader in the COSAS.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Were you alone when you kidnapped Mr Mohape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a>MR NGO:   No, it was Ditsametsi, Mamome, Ntyala and Cronje.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now where were these persons, were these </p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a>persons...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Sorry who were the last two please?  Ditsametsi, </p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a>Mamome, Ntyala and Cronje as in Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now how did you know these persons, what was your </p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a>relationship with these persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a>MR NGO:   Do you mean these people I committed this kidnap with?  Those </p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a>are the policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Were they stationed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a>MR NGO:   They were stationed at Fountain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Where is Fountain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a>MR NGO:   Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a>ADV MEMANI:   At whose command was Mohape abducted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a>MR NGO:   It was under the direction or instruction of Colonel Coetzee, </p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a>Erasmus and Shaw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Where did he give the order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a>MR NGO:   We were in the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Which office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a>MR NGO:   We were at parade when we were just about to knock off at </p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a>Fountain Police Station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a>ADV MEMANI:   And why was Mohape, before we go to that, when was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a>order to abduct him given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a>MR NGO:   I said at a parade when we were just about to knock off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a>ADV MEMANI:   And why was Mohape abducted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a>MR NGO:   He was influencing the students and again he was leading them to </p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a>commit public violence. When we laid charges against him in court he was able </p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a>to win all those cases. Then they were fed up because they said every time we </p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a>lay charges against him he always has lawyers. We detained him for a while, </p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a>then when he was supposed to be released ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a>ADV MEMANI:   You said that they were now fed up. Who are these people </p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a>who were fed up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a>MR NGO:   I mean the police who were arresting for public violence, that is </p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a>Coetzee and them.  When he was supposed to be released we got that </p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a>information, then they said that we should come, after we have knocked off that </p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>we should come and kidnap him, so they phoned the Hilton Police Station </p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a>where he was detained, either Hilton Police Station or Bayswater Police </p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a>Station.  Then they were instructed that he should be not released early in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a>morning. After that they sent two policemen, that is Ditsametsi and Sgt </p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a>Mamome, then they said that they should wait for him somewhere, that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a>should observe his movements. On his way to the township they should arrest </p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a>him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Did that occur?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a>MR NGO:   Yes after we knocked off we took a car, we went to Ramkraal </p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a>then we waited for him there.  After some time when they were there we heard </p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a>them on the radio that they found him, they told us at Ramkraal, then we went </p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a>to that point together with Cronje and took him to the place called Cellar. That </p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a>is where we hit him with hammers and crowbars.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now was he able to recognise you at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a>MR NGO:   He was not able to see us on the face but we had balaclavas on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Did he according to your knowledge become aware of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a>identity before you applied for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a>MR NGO:   He was not able to identify us because we had balaclavas on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a>face and it was night and it was dark where we were assaulting him.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a>pressed him on the ground and at Bloemspruit and hit him there, then we left </p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a>him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a>ADV MEMANI:   And why was he beaten up at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a>MR NGO:   We were pressing him against the floor and he was trying to fight </p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a>back but every time we would win him and hit him.  As we were busy </p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a>assaulting him he managed to run away and he fell on the ground.  It wasn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a>quite a distance, he fell and then we just left him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Why didn't you for instance shoot him or kill  him at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a>stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a>ADV MEMANI:   We were not told to kill him, it was part of harassment just </p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a>to harass him.  If we were given an instruction to kill him we would have shot </p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a>him dead without any use of hammers, we were told just to assault him and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a>used hammers. We were told to kidnap him, assault him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a>ADV MEMANI:  Now what did he do after you beat him up and he ran away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a>MR NGO:   We also ran and we took the car and we drove off.  we do not </p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a>know what happened to him thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now you told us earlier on that the persons that were </p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a>involved were yourself, Ditsametsi, Mamome, Ntyala and Cronje.  Did all of </p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a>these persons actively participate in the beating up of Mr Mohapi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a>MR NGO:   The white man Cronje was left behind in the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Did the rest of you participate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a>MR NGO:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a>ADV MEMANI:   And how far away in the car was Cronje?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a>MR NGO:   It could have been towards the end of the hall I think.  We were </p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a>actually driving in two cars, he was taking care of the cars.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Twenty, twenty five paces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a>ADV MEMANI:   As the Chair pleases.  And was he at all times aware of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a>plan to assault Mr Mohape.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a>MR NGO:   Yes we left our place knowing that we have to assault him and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a>communicated with the radios and we followed them and they could see that </p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a>we were following him. They actually signed, they showed us a sign so that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a>could follow them and we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a>MR NGO:   Now what was the rank of Ditsametsi at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a>Let's start with yours, what was your rank at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a>MR NGO:   I was a constable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a>ADV MEMANI:   And what was Ditsametsi's rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a>MR NGO:   He was a warrant officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>ADV MEMANI:   And what was Mamome's rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a>MR NGO:   He was a sergeant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a>ADV MEMANI:   And Ntyala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a>MR NGO:   He was a constable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Cronje.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a>MR NGO:   He was also a warrant officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Was any of these persons acting in a supervisory capacity of </p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a>one kind or another over you at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>MR NGO:   They came with White to us but we were not told who was </p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a>supervising, but we knew that the warrant officer was the most senior person </p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a>and we would take instructions from him if it was necessary.  But the fact of </p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a>the matter is they came  Ditsomai and we followed them and we assaulted him. </p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a> The person who took care of the car was Cronje but the rest participated in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a>assault.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a>ADV MEMANI:   At the time when you were instructed to abduct or assist in </p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a>the abduction of Mr Mohape and during the assault of Mohape, did you regard </p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a>yourself as being a person acting in his capacity as a policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a>MR NGO:   It was our duty as the Security Branch members to kidnap people, </p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a>and if someone was troublesome with us we knew that we had to harass him.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a>We took it as a normal duty because we were involved in such activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Did you report to anyone about the incident after you had </p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a>finished dealing with Mr Mohape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a>MR NGO:   Mamume and them went to Coetzee to report that we found our </p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a>target and he was assaulted. I didn't personally stand up and say I did the job, </p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a>we have done the job.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Were you present when Mamume reported?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a>MR NGO:   Every day when we attended the parade we were together and it </p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a>was our responsibility to report about the deeds of the previous night.  I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a>present when the report was taken forward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Is it your evidence that Mamume reported at the parade the </p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a>following morning in your presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a>MR NGO:   Together with Ditsametsi, because they did indicate that they got </p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a>hold of him and he was assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   They reported at the parade, during the parade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a>MR NGO:   They told Colonel Coetzee at the office.  The parade field was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a>big.  We called it a parade because we had to report there every time and it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a>our parade because we reported in four-four and there were other offices in that </p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a>building where the members of the Special Branch were conducting their duty. </p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a> Now we also had this other office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE:   It was in the office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a>MR NGO:   Yes it was in the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Did you get any special reward for doing that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a>MR NGO:   We were not rewarded, it was part of our duty.  When we </p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a>kidnapped people we were not rewarded at all, it was the harassment that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a>had to do on such people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a>ADV MEMANI:   Now that concludes the application in respect of the kidnap </p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a>of White Mohape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   I think the time has come for us to adjourn, it is now 5 </p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a>o'clock. We'll adjourn until 9 o'clock  tomorrow morning.</p>
