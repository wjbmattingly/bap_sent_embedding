The single quarters was to house all black policemen stationed in the Pretoria surroundings\".\n\tAnd then paragraph 3, he says -\n\"Nelson Ngo was known to me personally as he approximately from 1987 up to the date of his arrest in approximately 1989, worked under my direct supervision at the Mamelodi police singles quarters\".\n\tThen he says that he will try and obtain as much documentation as possible, and that is what we are waiting for.  \n\tParagraph 4 -\n\"Mr Ngo was never a member of the Security Branch in the Transvaal and while he worked under my supervision at the singles quarters, he was a member of Unit 19, the Reaction Unit, stationed Rosslyn, Pretoria.\n\t\tMr Ngo together with Sergeant Ramala, both from Unit 19, was transferred to Mamelodi barracks under service arrangements by the mentioned Unit Commander, whose name I cannot remember, because Unit 19 had quite an amount of members who stayed at the Mamelodi singles quarters and Mr Ngo had to see to their needs.\n\tAnd then he says -\n\"Mr Ngo's duties  included the daily inspection of the singles quarters and the bedding, and he had daily to take post to the Mamelodi police station to be posted.

I am not arguing about that.\n\tBut what is happening here today seems to me to be something different.  It is going beyond merely coming to tell you that I am a victim and this is the way in which I became a victim and these are the people who attacked me and that is how I became a victim.\n\tIt seems to me Mr Chairman, that we are dealing here literally with a civil claim, so it seems.",

Now, you have the victims who are sitting in here who would have been present and who want to come and say no, Mr Visser's clients are not telling the truth.  They were there.\n\tAnd what should we do with that, you see it is going to be very difficult for us to say for example to prevent those victims from coming to confirm that let's say Ramosoeu was there and so on, and then in the end, we disbelieve and applicant and say well, Motsamai you were lying when you said Ramosoeu was not there, when in fact there were people here in the audience who could have come forward and confirmed that Ramosoeu was there.

I heard my learned friend say that we are dealing with civil actions, but this is not the purpose of the evidence we are hearing here today.  I don't even, we have to refer to the Act.\n\tThese assaults have already lapsed.  He was aware of the people, he could have brought civil actions at that stage.  The Police Act at that stage placed a certain limitation on this.
