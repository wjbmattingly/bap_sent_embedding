It happened that on their return from Virginia to Brandfort, Edward Phelane, as he was the driver to fetch that dynamite from Virginia, was detained together with the comrades who went to Virginia.  Edward Phelane became the state witness in that case, and those comrades were convicted and were at Grootvlei in those years 1986.  It happened that in 1986 we were arrested together with Morgan Phelane, it was on the 12th of June 1986, we were detained under the State of Emergency.\n\tIt happened that during that detention the comrades who were detained then in 1986, I'm not sure of the number but approximately it was about 100, all of those people who were detained were members of AZAPO, PAC and ANC. No one knew when he would be released.  I was surprised to learn from Mr Morgan Phelane that when he told us together with Mnani(?) that next week, the following week he would be released from prison.

Himself and the police know what happened.\n\tMany other activities done by those gangsters, when reaching the ears of the police would end there.

After Zola was released from trial, the attorney general released him because there wasn't adequate evidence at our trial.  After two months of his release he left for Johannesburg for about two weeks. On his return at Brandfort he had an argument with Edward Phelane's son and he was shot with Zola.  When the comrades explained the following day that the person who shot Zola Bosman was Sibikhoto.  The very witness was arrested and lashed and assaulted and the blame was laid on him.

We were the Matemasu Youth Congress and we engaged in consumer boycotts and we would discuss it among ourselves that we are not going to buy in town for a certain period until our demands are met. What was happening and during this consumer boycott, when people were at work, we would have members of the youth to stand at the gate where we know is a passing point for everybody who was going to town, and we would make it a point that every person who comes from town doesn't have anything in his possession that he has bought in town. Any car that was coming from the town would be stopped and we searched it.  But Mr Morgan Phelane's car and the car belonging to his son, Edward Phelane, they would not stop, even if we requested them to stop. Even a person who wanted to buy would do that freely knowing that he will be given a lift because that car won't be searched.  Mr Phelane knew very well our intentions.\n\tIn other words, Mr Morgan Phelane was not happy at all about our activities.  He was also involved in the politics and he knew very well that consumer boycott was a strategy used by the ANC to cripple the De Klerk Government but himself, Mr Morgan Phelane showed the public that he was against the freedom of the people.\n\tOne day the school kids were marching, they were marching from the school into the township.  I am not sure as to the direction they were marching to, I don't know where they were really going to, I'm sorry.  It happened that as they were marching from the school, his son's car approached, that is Morgan Phelane, and it was driving at a very high speed and it went to the marchers but the children were very careful, they saw it from far away and they managed to jump out of the road because they realised that this car was speeding and there was a possibility that it would never stop. And it was known that the driver of the car was against the song the kids were singing.\n\tWhen this gangster heard the slogans or the people toyi-toyi'ing, they would harass the youth and they would start violence and at the end of the slogan there would be fighting. All these activities were done by Mr Phelane's gangster. As the self defence units of Brandfort we also realised that these people are going too far, we have to take a step to counteract what they were doing in the community and truly we came together as the self defence unit and we planned how to kill them.

He was holding a gun with his two hands and I used mine to grab his and we fought over this gun. With God's help until the gun was in my hands and I thanked God that the gun was now in my hands. At that time he got a chance to run into the tavern. \tI realised that leaving him would be a danger because he was the most dangerous person in the gang.

When the Commission interrogates him, please I want it to be clear. It was asked in the court about this firearm.  Mr Edward Phelane was asked about this firearm.  Mr Phelane, you agree that Jack stole this firearm from you and he was asked the question, where did you get hold of this firearm? And he said he was given that gun by a policeman.  He said the policeman was paying him with this gun, seemingly the policeman owed him. Why do I include this issue.  I want the Commission to be clear that the gun did not come to me according to the story he put forward to the judge.\n\tI have indicated that the gang was in cahoots with the police and the policeman who gave Edward Phelane the gun had an intention of Edward Phelane using this gun against us members of the ANC.  I want that to be clear.  He agreed that a policeman owed him and he gave him this firearm instead.  I am giving you the real reason.  That is my point of view.  The reason for him to get a gun was to come and use it against us.  Thank you.\nNO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV MEMANI\nCROSS EXAMINATION BY MR PHELANE (VICTIM)",

In other words, it is going to be decided together when we decide on the other related offences. What we are concerned now at this stage is your request for the adjournment of the matter to go and call that person and personally I think that we should rule against you and say that we are not adjourning the matter solely for the purpose of going to call a witness who is coming to repeat something which the applicant has said, which something is not being opposed by anybody and I don't think we need to adjourn the matter so that you should come and address us on that point.\n\tAs far as addressing us on the question of whether or not the applicant is entitled to amnesty in respect of an offence which he denies, that will be dealt with together with the other offences as well.  He doesn't enjoy any special treatment at this stage.
