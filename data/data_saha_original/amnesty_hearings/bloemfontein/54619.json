I just want to make that very, very clear.  We do not oppose your application for amnesty.  \n\tThe only reason why I'm putting questions to you pertains to the involvement of Colonel Loots and Captain Bokaba according to you, in the incidents you apply for amnesty for.  And the reason why I'm putting these questions is simply to test your evidence about their involvement and to put to you, the denial by them of their involvement in these incidents and also to test the credibility of your evidence in that regard.  \n\tThat is as far as our involvement goes, we do not oppose your amnesty application simply because Colonel Loots and Captain Bokaba are also persons who applied for amnesty, they are in the same position as you are and they feel that they don't have to oppose your application and they don't want to oppose your application.
