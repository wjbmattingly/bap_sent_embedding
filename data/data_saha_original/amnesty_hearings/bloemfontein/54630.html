<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Visser on record.  Allow me Mr Chairman, to apologise for the fact that the witness who gave evidence on Friday, Petrus Miningwa is not present this morning. I knew that one of my witnesses was writing examinations, the mistake I made was not realising that it was Mr Miningwa. He will be back here today by 12 o'clock Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Visser, you may have made the mistake but someone else on your part did not, and came and spoke to me on Friday afternoon and explained to me that he was writing an examination this morning and requested whether you could continue with someone else and he could come back after the exam and I agreed to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I was told Mr Chairman, and I just wanted to place it record, thank you Mr Chairman. May I call the witness Mmelesi, spelled: M - m - e - l - e - s - i.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>    There is no affidavit of that witness before you Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you know Mr Ngo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> The time I arrived here, I saw him at the security branch offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And as far as your knowledge goes goes what was his position, his status, at that time in 1985?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I thought he was a member of the security branch but I learnt from others that he was a recruit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you ever work together with Mr Ngo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir, I haven't worked with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You also know Mr Motsamai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I know him very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He was in fact a member of the security branch, was he not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you work with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir. We were working all of us working at the security branch but we were working at various sections, I was not working with him in one section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In 1985 to 1986, can you give us a guesstimate of how many members worked in the security branch here in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> It was investigation section and ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I just want, I'm sorry, to interrupt you. I just want you to tell us about how many members in total worked in the security branch in Bloemfontein in 1985/86. If you can't remember, just say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> We were many, I don't remember, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now, it has been alleged here by Mr Ngo that you participated in the incident which we have referred to in this case as the group of 19 people who were interrogated and detained here in Bloemfontein in 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>    Now if it were to be suggested that you did anything wrong, that you performed any illegal or unlawful act, what would you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I did not take part. The way I had if there was something wrong which I did in that time, I did not assault any person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you see anybody being assaulted in your presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir, I did not see a person being assaulted in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you interrogate some of the comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> That is correct.  There were those I interrogated, I acted as an interpreter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you remember any of the persons today, that you interrogated at that time or that you interpreted while they were being interrogated at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> There were many, I don't remember their names.  When I say there were many, some of them I started to see them now.  I am not able to locate them to the interrogation during that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> On how many days - can you remember on how many days you took part in the interrogation as an interpreter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I'd say I took part in four incidents were I took part in the interrogation as an interpreter, I don't remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You say four incidents. Do you mean four occasions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> It is like this, Sir.  When I say it's four occasions, at some days we'd do our normal work but at times when I was in the office I would help during the interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I have no further questions, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr MMelesi, did you have any contact with Mr Ngo after he was transferred to Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> No contact whatsoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>	Thank you, no further questions Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DU PLESSIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> We haven't met Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> By that you mean you didn't meet Ngo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I haven't met Mr Ngo.  I learnt that he was arrested and that he is in Grootvlei Prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR STANDER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>	Mr Mmelesi, what was the procedure that you followed during these interrogations of the group of 19 persons who were interrogated at the office of the security police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> The method we used in the interrogation we were asking them were they were going then they told us that they were skipping the country to Lesotho. Then we asked them about their contacts or contact, or who was their leader to skip the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Were they prepared to give their co-operation throughout?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> The way they answered the questions, some of them were prepared to co-operate. Even if some of them were not giving us the direct information we'll take one to give us the clear answers to the questions we asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> And if he or she did not want to give their co-operation what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> We leave him or her. We take another one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you would just leave then, you wouldn't try to press them to give information, you'd just accept that they didn't want to tell you.  Are you asking us to accept that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No, we were not forcing a person to - the person should just tell us that when he or she was asked those questions we'd leave him and we'd take another one and maybe later we'd go back to that person. There's no way we forced those people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Now if you returned to the same person later and this person did not want to give his co-operation yet, what then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I would not say is there after a long time. The way that person has been asked those questions, if you are not satisfied with those questions you'd leave that person to think well that he'd able to understand those questions, Not that he should be forced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> If you've - once you've given him a good chance to think about it and you come back to that man, or to the women, and they still do not want to co-operate, what would happen then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> We'd continue with others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No, we don't just leave that person like that. I explained that if he or she does not want to give us direct answers we'd take another one so that we'd give that person a chance think the time about the whole incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what happened if after they had time to think they still didn't want to give you answers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> We'd go back to him or her again, we would take her to the interrogation room, then we'd continue with the questioning, then he would he would answer well the way the investigator or the interrogator wants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I do not understand this. Why would a person let's say that in two occasions this person does not want to co-operate, but for arguments sake at the third stage when he's asked again he co-operates.  Can you explain this to us?  Or is there something else that you did in order to force him to give you those answers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> We did not force a person to explain to us what happened. For the second time when we interrogate he would he would answer those questions well, not that we forced him or her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm afraid I don't understand why somebody who has indicated that they do not want to answer questions, would suddenly decide to answer the questions well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> It will depend on how he is being interrogated.  Let me explain this way.  We'd ask you questions and then you don't answer the questions, later, if you don't understand, we'd call you for a second time, then we'd take another person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>	Then again you'd be asked questions and be told that the answers that we were waiting for for these questions were like this, not that we'd forced that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I still do not understand and I do not think the Committee understands. What happened in the meantime to change that persons mind about answering the questions. Because why in the first place, would he not want to answer? And then on a later occasion when he is called in again then he answers to all your questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> There's nothing we did to that person.  I explained that if a person does not want to answer the questions, we did not force him or her or assault him, we'd leave her or him and take another person, then later would call him or her back without been assaulted, then he would answer those questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> The Chairman has also asked you and I've asked you for the third time. What led to the fact that this person now replied to your questions or can you not reply to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I explained Sir, that we did not force a person or maybe we did not assault that person so that he should answer those questions, it did not work like that.  That person would explained us well with how its being assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> What is the reason for that, do you know or don't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir, I did not know, but there was no person who would be able to explain, those people explained what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Do you think there's a possibility that such a person saw what had happened to the others and as a result of the fact that he saw what had happened to the others who did not co-operate who did not co-operate, that he then decided to give some answers? Is that not possibly what could have happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I want you to explain to me, to say, when you say maybe he saw what happened to other people in which way can you explain to me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> What I am trying to say is that he saw how the others were assaulted because they did not want to co-operate and that is why at the end of the day, he then gave his or her answers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I explained Sir, that no person was assaulted in my presence or the one I saw being assaulted. Those people answered to those questions well without being forced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> And did you see the rest of the group there that day as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> You mean you mean in the office?  Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Was there anyone who gave you an indication as that they had been assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Have you see - did you see the full group there on another occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Yes, I did the time when they were just about to be taken to where they were going to be detained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Do you regard frog jumps as part of abuse of the witnesses or don't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I did not see people doing frog jumps the way you - the ones you telling me about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you have any shock apparatus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir, we didn't have those things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> And a black bag which was sometimes used to cover peoples eyes or their heads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir, I didn't see something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> And the tyre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I said that I did not see those kinds of assortments, I did not see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Do you know a Oupa Makubalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Yes, I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Was he also part of the group that was there that had to be interrogated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Oupa was present in that group. But where I took part, I did not take part in Oupa's  interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Were you involved when he had to be taken to a doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> If I remember, no.  I dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> It doesn't sound as if you're being sure of the ...[indistinct]</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I said I was not present then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Was he ever taken to a doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I said I was not present and again I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> What was his condition the condition on the second or the third day after you'd arrested these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> We did not detain this group. The time when I arrived with Sergeant Du Plessis in the office after lunch, I learnt there were people who were brought here who tried to skip the country and they were arrested in Ladybrand and they were brought to our offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> The question that I asked was: did you see Oupa Makubalo on the second or the third day after he was arrested, did you see him, again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I explained that some days I was helping with the investigation and others days we were living out for our normal duty. Myself and Mr Du Plessis would leave the whole day and if I'm present I'd help there if it is necessary. But ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could you tell us whether you helped on the second day and whether you helped with the interrogation on the third day after they'd been arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> That is why I said I don't remember later as whethere I did.  At times, some days we'd leave but if I'm around I'd be able to help with the the interrogation.   At times I'd be there, at times I'd not be there.   As whether it was the second day or the third day, I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you see him again, Oupa Makubalo, after the first day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I explained that I do not remember as to whether it is the second or the third day because usually would leave together with Mr Du Plessis. I'm not sure as to whether I was in the office or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you not see him at all? That is the simple question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I say I don't know as to whether the second day I was in the office or I was not in the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I would like to put it to you Sir, that indeed after the second or third day you took Mr Oupa Makubalo to the doctor because of the fact that he had been assaulted to such an extent that his life was actually in danger at that stage.  Do you deny that or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMESELI:</span> I dispute that.  As I explained that on the first day I saw Oupa Makubalo in the office.  On second day as whether I was in office or not and again on the third day I do not know as whether I'm in the office or not but I I saw him in the office.  But its either on the second day or the third day I was in the office, I'm not sure. That's the way I have explained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have these records been made available?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Mr Chair, I am doing my best to get hold of them but I have not been able to do so.  I will see if I could do so soon and place this before the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If he was taken from the Fountain Street offices, one would expect documentary evidence to that effect to be available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>It seems a little suprising that the, as far as one can gather, because it hasn't been available to us, that no records were kept at Fountain Street and who was taken there for interrogation, when they were sent away and matters of that nature.   Police are usually fairly careful about these things,  </p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>	I raised this question last week about whether there was documentary evidence available and none appears to be forthcoming.  Does this mean that the dockets and other documents no longer exists, if they have been done away with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Mr Chair I cannot answer to this.  I will do my best by means of the hospital where he had been treated, to see whether any documentation is available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>   I would like to stat to you Mr Mmelesi, that you not only acted as a so called interpreter but that you actively participated in this interrogation of the persons and also the assault of on these persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I have answered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm sorry Mr Chairman, may I come in here? Would my learned friend please assist all of us by telling us who it is alleged that this witness assaulted because he hasn't put that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Just a moment Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>    Mr Oliphant do you know him, the person who is known as Chine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Yes, I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> He also alleges that you assaulted him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> He's lying Sir, I did not assault him and I did not assault any person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you also participate in the interrogation of any of the women present there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Yes, I took part in the interrogation, there may be two or three.  As I explained that the base which I was in office, I took part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Am I correct if I also say that there were no female interrogators when the females or women where interrogated?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> That is correct, Sir.  Let me explain, Sir, the interrogation room was the person who the interrogator it might be a male and then myself and the person who has been interrogated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Was there a special interrogation room then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No, there was the - there were no people in those offices who would use - in their offices as interrogation rooms as interrogation rooms, then that person would sit there, then I would sit on the other side, then the interrogator would sit on the other side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Please tell me, where you present when Oupa Makubalo at a later stage, was arrested and shots were fired in his direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir, I was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Where you on duty on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I was always on duty all the time but I did not take part in that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you know that he was arrested on the day and that they returned him to Fountain Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Is it possible that you could have been with them and that you just can't remember this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir, I said I was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Sir, I would like to put it to you that you indeed were in the vehicle which went to arrest him when the shots were fired in his direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Sir, I said I was not present there. Understand well, I was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Do know who were all the people who were present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I know nothing, I was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you see when he was brought in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir, I did not see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Can you tell me where your office is in the security branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> When you enter the 5th floor, it was first one on the left side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you office look out on the so called Violent Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> The this thing of Violent Street suprises me because that is a passage which goes at the back like when Mr Erasmus - the direction of his - from the door you got the toilet and the toilets for females who are on the left and for male are on the right.  Our offices are facing the direction which I'm looking and the passage go across.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Why was it called this so called Violent Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir, it was a sticker which was put on the wall which was written Violent Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> So the passage wasn't known as Violent Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Maybe there are people who call it that but I say the the poster was put there written Violent Street.  The passage was long and it was on those offices in 5th floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Because one after the other witness had referred to that passage on the 5th floor as so called Violent Street and some of the police officers who have testified here admitted that. Now I don't understand why you ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just wait a minute.  I understood the evidence we have heard, we have heard - I can't remember what policeman now, of a passage that his office is in and which then joins another passage which was the one he said was called Violent Street. Is that not the position?  There's more than one passage on that floor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Mr Chairman, I gained the impression that there was only one passage but perhaps we could ascertain that I may be wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>    Could you explain to us the layout of the passages on the 5th floor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> You must listen very carefully Sir.  This is a passage, it goes back and here where I'm pointing its a door, then it turns to the left to those two doors, then that is the toilet, then you turn on the left there's a kitchen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Which of these two passages which you told us about now was known as the so-called Violent Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't know perhaps your the best one to tell us Mr Stander, I gather the security police no longer occupy this. The building is there, who are occupies is now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Mr Chair I can't tell you, I don't know the answer to that question.  As far as I know there are still members of the police force in there but I don't whom exactly but its not far away from here, its approximately a block away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Wouldn't it be possible, rather than have this confusion and have witnesses trying to persuade, - trying to tell us, for us to adjourn at some stage and walk that block and see what the floor looks like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, if I may come in here, Visser on record.  This very thought has occurred to us already last week and we have asked Colonel Erasmus to attempt to make arrangements so that we - we wanted to know first of all whether we'd have access to the building before we approached you with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>    At, at this stage there is a problem with the 5th floor, apparently there's legislation declaring an off limits area to to the public.  I'm not sure in what or some such, its got something to do with National Intelligence, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>    We are attempting, I think Mr Chairman, I am speaking under correction, but we are attempting to obtain permission to enter the 5th floor, that's the one thing, but in any event, what we are attempting to do is to obtain floor plans of each and every floor and to give that at least to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>    But we are working on getting us into the building there's just a problem with the 5th floor as I understand the position to be at the moment but we're working on that very issue Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The 5th floor is really the only one we want to see, we don't want to get into the building as such but if we could do that perhaps cross-examination as to the details of the geography of the floor could stand over until we know whether we can see it ourselves or get a proper floor plan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  Before I step down from this aspect, let us then call this passage with the board Violent Street and ask the question whether your office actually faced on this passage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI::</span> The door of the office we were occupying faced the passage and this passage proceeded ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> What did you call that passage?  Did it have a name, for instance: Peace Street or whatever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> This passage did not have a name, Sir.  The only thing that was there was a sticker put on the wall and I do not know who put that sticker there.  I call it a passage, it did not have a name.  The sticker was called Violent Street but that was not the name of that passage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was the sticker in your passage or did it point towards the other passage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> That is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> It can't be correct because I've asked you was the sticker in your passage or did it point towards the other passage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Sir, I explained that there were two passages, there's a door, there's a passage going to the right and the other one going to the left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> The sticker, was it pointing to the passage going to the right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> The passage to the left when you were going to the kitchen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you ever enquire about this sticker on the door on the wall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir. I tried to ask what was happening with that sticker but no-one gave me a clear indication of why the sticker was put on the wall. All the members could see that, I do not know whether the sticker is still there or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> You didn't go to any trouble to remove it because according to your testimony it had no meaning whatsoever. Do I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I do not know, Sir, but I just saw it as a sticker that was put on the wall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Could you have removed it yourself, had you so wished?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> The problem was I did not know who was the person who put it there. And I did not take that into consideration.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> You also didn't go to any trouble to enquire about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I would like to state it to you Sir, that that sticker had been placed on that wall because people were continuously assaulted and tortured in that passage and that is why it was known as Violent Street.  Could you reply to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Do you deny it or don't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I dispute that, I never seen anyone assaulted in that passage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> No further questions to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STANDER</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Mmelesi, as of 6th of April 1986, was your floor on the 5th floor or was it on the 4th floor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> We were on the 5th floor, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I meant you office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> We were in the 5th floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And on that day you worked with Terreblanche</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>and Du Plooy, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> When I arrived at the security branch I worked with those people you just mentioned.</p>

<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Perhaps you could tell him what the 6th of April was. I can't remember what the 6th of April 1986 was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> This is the day when the 19 people were ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well tell him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I thought its common cause Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>	 And this is the day on which the 19 people were detained. Do you remember that now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Sir, I do not remember when it comes to dates but I remember that there were people brought to the offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, on that day, when these people were detained, did you assist the officers on the 4th floor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I helped in the investigation department to ask those people questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Where did you help the investigation department?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMESELI:</span> On the 4th floor, that is where the investigation was done, we were in the 5th floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And who - which white officer were you working with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMESELI:</span> Its a long time Sir, I do not remember but the person I was working with very well was Sergeant Du Plessis but he was not involved in the interrogation section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, I'm talking about this particular day. Who did you work with on that particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Sir, I said I do not remember well because this happened long time ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> How many people did you interrogate on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> On that day, i think two, if not four.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And who were the persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I do not remember them, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Did you get any information from these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> The way the interrogator proceeded he was satisfied with the answers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Was he satisfied with all of them as and when he started interrogating each of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> On that day where I participated, he asked them questions and they explained to him well what  happened, why they decided to leave, he was satisfied. I was an interpreter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> In short, all of them co-operated?  None of them at any stage did not co-operate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Where I took part, I said they satisfied him.  No-one was stubborn, they all answered questions without being forced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And they co-operated from the onset is what I'm putting you, why can't you say yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I said yes I've explained that if a person did not want to co-operate then but I said the time when I was there nobody was not co-operating, they answered those questions well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You see, earlier on your evidence was that people were asked questions and those who did not co-operate was taken upstairs and then they would be called for the second time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm sorry, I have to object Mr Chairman, the questions which he answered, and I attempted to listen very carefully, were put to him on the hypothesis that if somebody refused to answer questions, what would you then do?   And he said the answer which my learned friend has now given, he has not been asked by anybody until right now, whether the people did in fact co-operate. There's a difference, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> My recollection is he said he was asked what sort of [End of tape 1, side A - no follow on sound]  I aske him who their leaders and contacts were, some were prepared to co-operate, others were not, we would just leave them.  We would just leave them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>    Let me later go back to these people ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> That, with respect, is my note Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I do think it's fair to say though, that his answers were all speculative always if, if, if.  I don't think that he in that portion of evidence said that they did in fact do this, this is what they would have done.</p>

<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, that is I think, what I tried to convey.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> My understanding Mr Chair, was that the context in which the words if and would were used were not used in a speculative sense but they were used to explain what what would occur as what occurred in fact on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>    It was not only hypothesis. It was what did you do what would you do if people did not co-operate on that day?  They were specific to what would happen on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well Mr Chairman, I don't want to waste time.  Let him put the question to the witness and let the witness field for himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> In any event it has emerged that you told us that some people did not co-operate on that day and that is contrary to what you just put that none of them did not co-operate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I did not say they were not co-operating. You asked me, saying: "If people did not answer questions what did they do"?, I answered and said: "Those who did not want to ask questions would just leave them and ask others. And later would bring them back and interrogate them and they would answer those questions well".</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now mister, - I'll leave the rest of the things for argument.  The next that I wanted to ask you is where - in which office where you on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> We were on the 4th floor the time when we were interrogating these people.  This thing happened a long time ago, I don't know whose office - I don't remember whose office was that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And who was present with you?  You say you don't recall that as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I did not - I don't remember as to whether whom I was assisting in the interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You don't recall who was with you, you don't recall in which office you were and you don't recall who you interrogated on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I explained that it happened a long time ago, I don't remember.  I would not say it's this person or that person because there were many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You don't recall whether people co-operated immediately or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> You asked me a question as to - the first person asked me as to whether those people were co-operating or not.  I'd say were I was they were co-operating, where a took part as an interpreter, those people were co-operative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I find it strange, in the light of the fact that you have forgotten so many things that you can recall that you arrived in the office at 1 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> That is so because on that day I was together with Mr Du Plessis.  We were going to investigate then after lunch we came back to the office. And when we arrived there Mr Du Plessis told us that the ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And what time did you leave work on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> We'd knock off at 4 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Did you actually knock off at 4 o'clock on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I say we knock off at 4 o'clock.  On that day we took them to where they were supposed to be detained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And the evidence was that the detainees were taken to the various police stations after 5.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I explained that on that day, usually we knock off at 4 o'clock but on that day we did not knock off at 4 o'clock.  We were supposed to take those people where they were supposed to be detained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But why didn't you say that a moment ago when I asked you whether - what time did you knock off, you said - why did you not then just say we knock off at 4 o'clock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> That is like that.   I say usually we knock off at 4 o'clock but on that day we were supposed to - we did not go home, we were supposed to take those people to where they were supposed to be locked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Counsel asked you specifically how do you remember you remember you arrived there at 1 o'clock, and you told us you'd been working with DuPlessis and when you arrived back after lunch you were told about this.  Counsel then said what time did you knock off that day and you said 4 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Let me clear it off.  We usually knock off at 4 o'clock, but at on that day we did not knock off at 4 o'clock, we were supposed to take those people were they were detained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, where did you take them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> We took them to Glen, if I remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> With whom did you go to Glen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I don't remember because we were many, we took them with cars and Kombis. I don't know  which Kombis because some of them were not more in use.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And you don't recall the other person who was present when you took the persons except yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> We went with Kopi, Mafisa and Lieutenant Terreblanche, Warrant Officer Swanapoel.  I explained that with whom I was working during that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But the question Mr ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> The question is: "On that day, can you remember with whom did you - did you go with a Kombi yourself?  Who was driving the Kombi?  Where you guarding the detainees?  What was your function in that Kombi or motor car or whatever you've been in? You yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I said I did not - I don't remember as to who was driving and where was I sitting but what I know is that we took these people to where they were detained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> With whom were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I don't remember with whom I was within that group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>	Do you remember if Mr Motsamai was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Sir, I said we were many I do not remember as whether other people from various sections helped or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> My instructions are that the only people you took prisoners were yourself, Kopi and Motsamai.  ...[inaudible] can you because you can't remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I said its like that but I do not remember. The we were those people were many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> The detainees were many?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> There were 19 all in all. I do not remember who was there on that day and who was not there on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> There were only three policemen, yourself, Kopi and Motsamai.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I said I do not remember whether other members from various sections helped to take these people to where they were supposed to be detained. I don't remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And Mr Memanie, were they all travelling together in one vehicle, all 19 detainees and the three policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> My instructions are that it was not all 19 that were travelling in the same vehicle that Motsamai, Mmelesi and Kopi were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>    Now, Mr Mmelesi, for how long did you see Mr Ngo at security branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I don't remember, but I'd say it may be a month or two, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> ...[inaudible] period, a lengthy period, longer than two months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No it might not be more that two months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And at that stage you believed that he was a member of the security branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> The time when I arrived in the office he was there, I just took it that he was a member of the security branch but when I enquired they told be that he is a recruit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And he worked there regularly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Yes, he was working as if he's a permanent staff member, that is why I regarded him as a member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And I want us to go back to the passage. I  I got the impression that the 5th floor forms an L.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> That is correct.  As I've explained that this passage would go this way, and here is a door and then it would go towards the main entrance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> So you mean capital letter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And Kopi described the area beyond the door as Violent Street.  Did you hear him say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I heard but I said myself it is a sticker which has been put on the wall.  It's a sticker, it's not the name of the passage which is Violent Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But it is suprising that detainees would be there occasionally knew that the police called that passage Violent Street and you who was working on that passage did not know that your colleagues referred to that passage as Violent Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I dispute that.  I say when you enter the door you see the sticker first, then you'd just regard that that is a Violent Street but not that the name of that passage is Violent Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> ...[inaudible] by one of your colleagues that there was a sticker there and on one occasion, a detainee when he was brought onto the 5th floor, because of that sticker referred to it as Violent Street and from that time onwards the passage was known as Violent Street - actually it was Mr Kopi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I would not dispute what he said but I said I knew only that as a passage then I saw that sticker, then I was not present him that from today that passage would be known as Violent Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Is you evidence that a you have never at all yourself came to know that that passage was commonly referred to as Violent Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I  explained that there was a sticker which has been put there written Violent Street.  Nobody told me that you should know as from today that this passage is now known as Violent Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Sorry, sorry, I'm not asking you whether somebody did tell you that this is Violent Street. I'm only asking you, did you not come to know, just as other people came to know, that that passage was commonly known as Violent Street?  You never knew that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir, I dispute that.  That what was only there was a sticker written Violent Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Are you hearing today for the first time, that that passage for whatever reason was commonly known as Violent Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No. I don't dispute what you're saying, I - everybody would call that Violent Street because of the sticker which has been put there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Oh, you do know that everybody called that passage Violent Street because of the sticker?  You know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Not that I know but that I don't dispute. the reason is that when you open the door, the sticker has been put on the hall which has been written Violent Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You know you keep on repeating to every question I'm putting to you. You keep repeatedly coming back to stating that the sticker was put on the door. We know that, there's no problem about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>    What I want to know from you is, you mister  Mmelesi, at the time when you were working on the 5th floor, did you ever know that that passage, for whatever reason, was commonly referred to as Violent Street, or did you not know?  Either you knew or you didn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir, I did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Are you hearing, for the first time during this proceedings that that passage was commonly known as Violent Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir, that is not so. I'm saying the people who entered there saw the sticker on the wall, you'd even see it there yourself.  Nobody told me that you must know that this passage is called Violent Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You're going to realise that I'm going to expect you to answer my question, the way you want. I'm asking you, are you hearing for the first time during these proceedings that that passage was known as Violent Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No, I explained that it is not the first time.  Everybody who entered there would see that that sticker and would call that passage Violent Street but nobody specifically said this is Violent Street, this is not my first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But why, have you said repeatedly to my brother: "I did not know it was commonly called Violent Street"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Sir, I said nobody told me that it was Violent Street, it was a sticker that was put there. If you entered there you'd even tell yourself, oh well this is Violent Street by just seeing the sticker.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I'm going to put this question for the last time and if you don't answer it, I'm going to leave it.  You knew that that passage, whether as a result of the sticker being put there or not, you knew, even at a time when you were still a member of the security branch, that that passage was commonly referred to as Violent Street.  Did you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Sir, people who entered that passage called it Violent Street.  I'm saying I just saw that sticker there, It doesn't mean I knew it was Violent Street.  Whether I called it Violent Street or not, the people called it Violent Street, I did not know it was Violent Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I told you it was for the last time I'm going to ask you that question I'm going to leave it there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>    Mr Mmelesi, the people that were taken to to Glen we've been told had injuries.  Did you see that people had been injured, that you conveyed to Glen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I said that there was no person who has been assaulted in my prescience.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I'm not saying to you that the persons were assaulted in your presence. I'm saying that when you conveyed them, the people had been injured already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir, I don't agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And, subject to correction, Oupa Makubalo had had lost his tooth as a result of being assaulted on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir, I did not hear that that somebody lost a tooth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Those are my questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MEMANI</p>

<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BRINK:</span> Just one question, Mr Chairman. Did you ever see blood stains on the wall, one of the walls, or both walls of Violent Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> No Sir, I did not see blood stains.</p>

<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER::</span> Just one question, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a>	Mr MMelesi, you were asked about what would happen if you asked a witness questions which he refused to answer. And you said that you would leave him and perhaps come back to him later. What was the purpose of the interrogation as far as you were concerned on that day?   What did you want to do with the questions that the white person was asking them, what was the purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> They wanted to know as to where were those people going and their names and who were their contacts in Lesotho and that who was their leader. If I answer your question well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And if you got all that information, for example from a particular person, what would then have happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Then later WE would take that report to Mr Du Plooy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairman before - I have no further questions. But what has come to hand are the floor plans of the 4th and the 5th floor which I beg leave to hand up to you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>

<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER::</span> These are the only two that I've got, the only two floors that I've got Mr Chairman. I've got a few copies here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think the other floors have been mentioned at all. Have they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER::</span> There are three copies Mr Chairman, and some for our learned friends as well.</p>

<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speakers mike is not activated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Can you help us and tell us which passage was known as Violent Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, the evidence was that it's the passage that leads to the kitchen and if you look at the top of the page:  510 appears to have been the kitchen so that would mean - I haven't discussed this with my witnesses, I just got this to hand, that would mean that that would probably be the passage which is Violent Street.  If one takes the top of the page as North for purposes of argument, it would be the South North/North South passage then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Are you all at idem?  Your witnesses, are they saying the same about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I've just said I haven't discussed the plans with ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But kindly find out Mr Visser, he's sitting next to you, so that we don't need to come back to this again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Colonel Erasmus explains to me Mr Chairman, that looking at the floor plan, the passage running from South to North, if North is the top of the page, was Violent Street.  That is the one running in the direction of the kitchen marked 510 and apparently there's a staircase or whatever and their are toilets on the right hand top side which does not appear on your - only a part of which appears on the page.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>    If you look down at the bottom, if I may say the Southern end of the passage on the left hand side, you see there's a circle and a cross, whatever that is supposed to indicate I don't know but it was in that vicinity that the sticker was attached to the wall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>	In other words on the left hand side as you walked into the passage, next to room 511, on the left hand wall that is where the sticker, according to Colonel Erasmus's recollection, was put on the wall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It appears from the other plan that next to the circle and cross are the letters BR or BK, I think that it's BR.  What that means, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, we don't know at the moment, but we will try to establish whether there's any -  whether we can find out what the letters are and what they stand for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Visser, on the plans, on the 5th floor you've got a partition in the foyer and on the 4th floor its an open space leading to the two passages, I don't know whether that was the position at the time or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, my instructions from Lieutenant Shaw and Colonel Erasmus is that, looking at the floor plan of the 5th floor, the marks made there represent a trellace, 'n traaliwerk, with a door, a security door and it was exactly at the time in 1986 there was a similar trellace on the 4th floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>    So both the floors had at the same  security entrance as it were, from the lift well.  Shall we, perhaps, give this an exhibit number, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it necessary for just the floor plan, it's the only floor plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, we can just call it, just refer to it as the floor plan. Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> While we've got this witness here, could we perhaps ask him to look at the plan and whether he understands the plan of the 5th floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a>    Do you understand this plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> I'm still looking at the plan Sir.   Yes, I see the plan, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you indicate on that plan, which is the office that you worked in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> If I'm not mistaken, they don't have numbers here, Sir. They are not numbered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>    If I'm not mistaken, it's office 409.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The 5th floor we are supposed to be looking at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Pardon me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>    I think it's 5029, this is the number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, that office is not marked with a number unfortunately it was marked: "stoor" beforehand and apparently later on certain walls were put up, he's referring ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just office on the corner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Not the one on the corner, he's referring to 5029 as I understand it.  If he could just perhaps with a pencil mark, mark it Mr Chairman, it might be the easiest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Sir, I remember the first one, it was a store room, this is the office number.  I think it was 22.49 if I'm not mistaken. It's 508.  Sir, it's 508.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is the office number written in the doorway?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMELESI:</span> Yes, the number is written on the door, it's 509.</p>

<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Tsoametsi, is it correct that you are a retired warrant officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And is it correct that you were a member of the security branch in Bloemfontein in 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When did you join the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> On the 1st of December 1965.</p>

<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> In 1973, in May.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And which section did you work in the security branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I was in the white section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And who was your commanding officer in that section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> It was Rudie Crouse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were there other members in that section apart from you and Rudie Crouse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Will you just mention the names of the other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Warrant Officer Piet Naude, Warrant Officer Leon Kalitz and Sergeant Joseph Lichaba, L - i - c - h - a - b - a.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you know Mr Ngo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you tell the Committee when you remember today, since when you became aware of Mr Ngo and what did you think was he doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> If I remember very well, I say Ngo at our offices on the 5th floor. It was somewhere around 1983, but I could not speak to him because the rule was to look at the person and pass.  But I remember one day it happened that I asked him who's son he was, where was he born, and he said to me he was Ngo from Pietersberg and I said: "Oh well, I know the place.  I was once a student there, I went to school with Kaffir Ngo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>    And he said: "That was that is my uncle" and that was it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Are you aware that in 1986, Mr Ngo became a recruit constable, a student constable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In the period from March 1986 until July 1986, did you work with Mr Ngo while you were executing your duties in the white section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could you kindly repeat the period Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, it is from March 1986 to July 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I was not working with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you working with Mr Motsamai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you remember today, in 1986 more or less, how many members were there in the security branch, in 1985/1986 here in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> It is difficult to remember, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Right.  Mr Tsoametsi, you filed an affidavit, I'm sorry, signed an affidavit is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is that an affidavit in which you went to Pretoria to see Mr Wagner about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> On that occasion, did Mr Motsamai accompany the group who went to Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did anybody force you to go to Pretoria to see Mr Wagner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did anybody at any stage prescribe to you, told you what to say or what to write in the affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you confirm the truthfulness and correctness of the contents of your affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In your affidavit you deny that you made yourself a party to any illegal or unlawful act, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now Mr Ngo, has alleged that you took part in the kidnapping and assault of Mr White Mohapi during 1986.  First of all did you take part of Mr White Mohape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you assault him at any stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It is alleged that orders were given by Lieutenant Shaw and Lieutenant Erasmus that you and Mamome had to go to the Bayswater police station to pick up White Mohape.  Well, actually it's not the Bayswater Police Station, it is alleged that you had to the Hilton Police Station so that you could follow White Mohape after his release. Did that happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Sir, that did not happen. Let me shortly explain.  It was not possible for Shaw and Erasmus to give me instructions without first going to Rudi Crouse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And are you saying - did Mr Crouse give you any such instructions to follow White Mohapi and to kidnap him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No.  We were working in the white section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And Mr Ngo went on to say - page 25 of the application, Mr Chairman, went on to say that you and Mamome kidnapped Mr White Mohape and that you radioed the information to Ngo, Motsamai and Mthyala, spelt M-t-y-h-a-l-e.  Did that happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI::</span> Mr Chairman, I do not want to unnecessarily delay these proceedings. My recollection is that Mr Ngo was in the company of the white policeman.  I think it was Cronje, the evidence was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well then, my learned friend can put it to the witness Mr Chairman.  I'm putting to the witness as I read the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>    At any event that Mr White Mhopi was taken to an open field between Bloemfontein - Bloemspruit rather, Bloemspruit and Shannon, where he was beaten up. Do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I did not know that, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You are ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, my instructions are that Ngo was with Cronje, Mtyhala and Mamome in a vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> No, earlier on I said my recollection was that Mr Ngo was with Cronje and I'm saying that Mr Ngo has corrected me and he says that he was with Cronje, Mtyhala and Mamome as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well Mr Chairman, I would like to see where it is at page 24 or 25 because a don't read the word Cronje there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a>    I'm not saying that he didn't say that he didn't say so in his evidence, that's not at all what I'm saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I'm sorry, Mr Chairman, I put it wrongly again.  It's Mtyhala, Cronje and the applicant and Mamome was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Not the applicant, the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMAME:</span> The applicant, Mr Ngo, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Repeat the names, who was in this car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> In the vehicle it was Mtyhala, Cronje, Ngo, in one vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So my learned friend is making it absolutely clear that he's instructions now are that Mr Motsomi wasn't present. Is that what I must understand from what he's putting, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I don't think you want to be taken seriously, we are talking about what you've just put. About the names that you have just used now. I'm telling you that in the vehicle in which Ngo was there were Cronje and Mtyhala and that's different from what you put.  That's what I'm ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But what he is putting is what appears in the application, he is reading from the application.  He is not varying it he is reading the application which was made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I'm not sure now, Mr Chairman, whether the application says that in the vehicle that Ngo was travelling there was anybody else except Mtyhala and Cronje.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Perhaps you should read the application and so see that Mr Visser is correctly reading it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> He hasn't referred us, where is he referring to, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The application, pages 24 and 25.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It's right at the foot of the page.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But Mr Chairman, you will recall that there was evidence.  The evidence that was lead specifically about the car, was that Cronje was Cronje was the person who was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He is not talking about the evidence that was lead Mr Memane, he is talking about the application and that is what he is putting to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But, Mr Chairman, ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He is not alleged, not made any reference evidence that was led.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But then also then, if you go by what you say, there's no specific reference to a vehicle in this passage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't understand what you are talking about, Mr Memane. Mr Visser is asking this witness - is putting to this witness what appears in the amnesty application lodged by Mr Ngo and asking him to comment on it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But when he does so Mr Chairman he must put the entire version correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He has put, as far as I know.  What has he not put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Maybe I made a mistake.  What is it that being put, exactly, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What has he not put?  What are you objecting to that you say he has not what appears in the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You see my understanding Mr Chairman, is that this kidnapping was was conducted by people, different people who were in different vehicles and at different times joined together - but were later jointed together at a later stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a>    And what I'm saying is that at material times Ngo would say that he was with Mtyhala and Cronje in a vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And Mr Visser has not asked this witness about being in a vehicle with them?  He hasn't mentioned that has he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Presumably, Mr Chairman, he's saying - My understanding is that he's saying that the ...[inaudible] with the witness, prior to them arriving at the veld where Mr Mohape was being beaten up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Visser, am I wrong?  Have you not just been reading what appears in the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Nothing more and nothing less, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The precise words.  What is your objection Mr Memane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, if he's just reading the application for the sake of reading then that's fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a>	Well, I'm not quite sure what the last question was, but let me try to pick it up like this Mr Tsoametsi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a>    The allegation is that yourself and Mr Mamome took Mr White Mohape to a veld between Bloemspruit and Shannon and that there they were joined by Motsamai, Mtyhala and Ngo, where all five of you beat up Mr White Mohape.  Hammers and crowbars, now what do you say of that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, not ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is not true, it is a lie what Ngo is saying. I know nothing about hammers and crowbars and the kidnapping of Mohape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Tsoametsi, last week you were requested, while you here in the Commission hall, to stand up so that the commission could look at you and I think you were described as stoutish person.  How would you describe yourself, your body build?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is true, I am stout.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And, since when did it happen that you became stout?  Sorry, for how long has your body build been the same as it is today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Since long time ago I've been stout, Sir, I've never been thin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Tsoametsi, we can then go on to - page 27 Mr Chairman, of bundle A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a>	 It is suggested, alleged that at the time when the 19 comrades were brought to Bloemfontein, we know it was the 6th of April 1986, it is alleged that you and Warrant Officer Ramosoeu, - page 29, Mr Chairman, told Mtyhala and Ngo that they should drink two and a half litres of water to force the comrades to drink, two bottles each.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a>    Now, first of all, is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is not true, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you have anything to do with the 19 comrades who were transferred from Ladybrand to Bloemfontein in 1986, Mr Tsoametsi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No, no contact at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If anybody said that you had anything to do with their torture and assault, what would you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That person would be lying, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Reference to page 31, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a>	It is furthermore alleged that there was a group of people, a large group of 40  or more comrades who were students who were arrested at Botshabelo and the security branch members from Bloemfontein were involved in that.  And at page 34 of Mr Ngo's application, he alleges that members of the security branch Bloemfontein who participated personally and physically in the beating and torturing of all these comrades are - and your name is number four on that list.  He says you personally and physically beat and tortured those comrades. What do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Sir, that is not true because I explained that I was working in the white section, now, I've never worked once in Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Lastly, if it's alleged that you had anything to do with the assault on the home of Citi Mzuzwana, what would you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I would say it's a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In short Mr Tsoametsi, if it is alleged by any of the applicants that you committed any illegal or unlawful act, what do you say about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I would say he is lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I'm just going to refer you to D, The Offence, D at page 25 and particularly at page 26, ja page 26.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Of what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Of bundle A.  And I'm not going to lead any evidence Mr Chairman, because frankly I don't quite understand whether this witness is being implicated.  I will leave him now for cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a>    Perhaps just one last question.  Do you know that Mr Ngo left to Hamanskraal Police college in July of 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I not remember the month but I know he disappeared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> After he left Bloemfontein, did you ever have anything else to do with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What about the house of Max Makuba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, you will recall that when Mr Ngo gave evidence, he said that he went with Motsamai to attack the house. Thought it was the house of Max Makubalo but he now realises that it was the house of Citi Mzuzwana's parents or Citi.  We'll make some submissions about that, we're not entirely certain whether he refers to the parental home or of Citi himself.    That is why I asked on both legs, whether this witness knew about the bombing of the house of Citi Mzuzwana Mr Chairman, it's based on that evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I was just referring to your affidavits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, thank you Mr Chairman.  Well at the time, of course, the evidence hadn't been lead, so and in the application, Ngo made mention only of Max Makubalo and that is why that is in the affidavit as it is Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'll find it for you immediately, Mr Chairman.   Mr Chairman, if you -  bundle A, and I'm just finding a page for you quickly, a typewritten page.  Sorry, yes, it is at page, bundle C page 12, my attorney just pointed out.  And this is what what we had at the time or what Mr Wagner and the witness had at the time when the affidavit was signed.  And it is the item marked (b) little (b), just below the middle of the page</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a>"On instructions of Colonel Coetzee, who at that time held the rank of major, Warrant Officer Tsoametsi, Sergeant Mamome, Constable Mtyhala and I, petrol bombed the house of Max Makubalo in Rocklands"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a>Now that was changed, Mr Chairman.  If you need the reference to the record I can find that and give it to you but I won't be able to do that immediately.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a>      If you give me two seconds, I'm probably going to find it straight away, Mr Chairman.  I have a note here of around page 300 of the record but it may be the wrong reference, I think it may.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a>  Sorry, Mr Chairman it's around 300, but I'll find it and give it to you.  Is it a convenient time now perhaps to take the tea adjournment, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> ...[inaudible] this witness.  Warrant Officer Tsoametsi, having worked in the so called white section of security branch, does that mean that you investigated or monitored white persons whom you regarded, I repeat, as activists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a>    Just switch on your microphone before you speak.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Repeat your question, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm sorry, I didn't have my earphones on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Can you kindly repeat your question Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  You told us that you worked the white section, Mr Tsoametsi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is that the section which investigated or monitored white people who were regarded as activists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> To your knowledge or recollection, did you ever investigate a person by the name of P.A. Venter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a>	P.D. Venter I think it was Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The gentleman I'm referring to, just to perhaps jog your memory, was the person in regard to which Mr Ngo has made an application for amnesty for the murder and robbery of that person.  Do you know whom I'm speaking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> His dealt with this in his affidavit hasn't he, so I presume he knows who you're talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you for pointing that out, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a>	As far as you know, did you have a file on that person in the white section, that you investigated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you know whether he was an informant of the security branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before we go on, there's a matter which I need to raise and I'm afraid I overlooked it earlier.  And that is to try and get an estimate of how long we will be able to continue today so arrangements can be made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, we will obviously as we've done in the past fall in with any arrangements which you make, bearing in mind that there are consultations which I have to do in the evenings of course.  So frankly, we would prefer not to sit too late but we're absolutely in your hands, speaking for my team Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There are other matters which I would like to discuss with counsel after we've adjourned but I think 5 o'clock, having started at nine would be as late as we could expect people to work here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That would be emanently suitable Mr Chairman, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I've had agreement from the people behind me who do work all the time.  Very well, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I've completed the evidence in chief, thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a>Mr Tsoametsi, do I understand it correctly that you've already </p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a>retired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> When did you retire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> 1993 in March.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> And up to that date did you work as a member of the security branch in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> You testified that you became aware of the fact that Mr Ngo not was working at Bloemfontein security branch at one stage, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you after that date have any contact with him again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I saw him at the court before the Judges, it was in respect of this murder of Venter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you have any other form of contact with him before that court case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I saw him when he was assaulted by the students.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Am I correct if I say that this was while he was still working in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> He was still a student at that time, he was not yet in the police and that was when he was attacked by the school kids.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> I just want to put my question clearly. From the time that he left Bloemfontein, from that date until the date you saw him at court, did you see him or speak to him in the interim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM MR DU PLESSIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR STANDER:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a>	Mr Tsoametsi, where you also part of the group of security policemen who interrogated the 19 people who were arrested at Ladybrand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Where you at that stage part of the security police here in Bloemfontein? That is the sixth of March 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Can you tell us why you say that you did not participate in the interrogation or were you not on duty that day or what is the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I was on duty.  As I've explained earlier on, I was in the black section, I was in the white section.  Now there was nothing binding me and Crouse to go to the black section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a>    I did not ask them whether they needed my help even though I would have been in a position to help them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Please tell me, was a person by the name of Terreblanche busy with the interrogation of these people on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I would not give evidence to that effect, I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Do you know Mr Terreblanche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Is it true that he was a security policeman who was employed there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> A group of 19 people who have to be interrogated, do you agree if I say that it's a large group of people and that many people had to be involved in the interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I would not give evidence again Sir, to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I do not understand you, what are you telling us?  Is it not true that it was a large group of people who had to be interrogated at the same time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> You see you don't interrogate people simultaneously, you'd ask questions one by one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> And you say that you had no part in this interrogation of this group of 19?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Not at all, I did not take part at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Later that day when the people were taken to the different police stations, did you participate in that at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you see any of this group of people there that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I do not remember you see, because they were still young at that time. They might have shifted from their appearances when they were still young.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I'm afraid I do not understand you. Can not you even remember that this group of 19 people were interrogated there that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I'm saying Mr Chairman, even if they were interrogated I would not give evidence to that effect, I was not part.</p>

<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Can you remember that a group of 19 people were interrogated on the sixth of April 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I saw them, they were at the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> How many times did you see them there on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Sir, it is difficult because I was in and out of the building until late when we knock off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> What time did you go off duty on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> The usual knock off time was 4 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I hear what you are saying, but what time did you knock off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I do not remember. I only know that we used to knock off at four o'clock with the white person Crouse whom I was working with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you also sometimes interpret for the white security police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you also interpret for Mr Terreblanche at times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No, only Crouse and Naude.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Never for Terreblanche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Is it possible that you can recall each and every person for whom you interpreted after a period of approximately 13 years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No, Sir, those white people had their own black workers, I would not leave my white person and go to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Why I'm putting this question to you is that I have been instructed that on that specific day you acted as interpreter for Mr Terreblanche when Mr Oupa Makubalo was assaulted among others with a cricket bat  ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is not true, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Which procedure did you follow in the interrogation?  Let us take the situation of a person who is brought in for interrogation and this person does not co-operate, what did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Would detain him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> If it was important information that you knew him to have and he still did not want to give it to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> We would put such a person in the cells.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Was the information that you had to obtain not more important?  Let us accept that it was information that was urgent for action that you had to take in future, then surely it would be of no use to put such a person in the cells.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> If the person refuses to speak we take such a person to the cells.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> If it is possible that this information was absolutely imperative, then surely it would be no use to put such a person in the cells.  Which method would you follow then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> There would be no way Sir, if he is not co-operative we would tell the officer that we still having a problem with this person, we're taking him to the cells then we take such a person to the cells.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Any other method that was used, apart from putting him in the cells?  Is there any other method that you employed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> When a person refuses to speak, we'll take him to the cells so that the next day when we fetch him he would come sober minded and he would co-operate. There was no other way. There was no way of hurting this person or assaulting him or torturing him, we just took them to cells.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Let us take it further, let us say for one moment that the person's taken to the cells and he comes back and he still does not co-operate, what would you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> We explain to this person: "Look here, you will stay here in this house until you co-operate we're not going to release you".</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Are these the only methods that you used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> And the security police, did they in no other way than in this method the person was locked up until he co-operated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> We locked him up, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> At any stage, was physical violence used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Not in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> But by other members of the security police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I told you Sir, I said not in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Yes, but I'm asking you, did you know that other security police officers made use of violence to interrogate their people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No, not here in Bloemfontein. I was reading in the newspapers about such cases relating to security members what they did to people, killed people and we we only read these now lately because of the TRC, we did not know these things before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> And at no stage ever that you know of, did any person or member of the security police in Bloemfontein, lift his hand to a person he was interrogating?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No Sir, not between the time I started working here until I left. It might have been before my arrival or after my departure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I put it to you that it will be argued before this Commission that it is highly unlikely because it is obvious that when one needs or requires from a person information that is vital, then one will surely employ other methods in order to obtain this information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Understand Sir, if you assault a person trying to get information from him, you'd be saying to the person: "Keep quiet, keep quiet" because this person will be feeling pains.  He will be thinking of his families, he's children his future, he won't be saying anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Are there members of this group that you know were taken to doctors?  I'm now referring to this group of 19.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Where was your office situated, was it on the 4th or the 5th floor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> On the 5th floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did it also have an entrance which led onto Violent Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Can you tell us what your version is, how did Violent Street get its name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I remember one morning when we arrived we found the sticker already stuck on the wall, the sticker was written Violent Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you enquire as to who stuck it on the wall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No, I did not do enquires.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Is it so that from that that day onwards, the name of that passage was Violent Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> And it was general knowledge amongst all the police officers who were employed there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Do you think that it was a suitable name for that passage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Because that passage did not have any violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Why didn't you take the trouble ask the officers to remove the sticker because according to you nothing happened to justify that name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> My seniors even saw it, they could have removed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you enjoy working in a passage which was known as Violent Street while you, according to your own information, had no part in any assaults or ever heard of anybody who had been assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> You see I did not really concern myself with that sticker, it did not worry me a single moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> You were working in that passage, surely its not nice to work in a passage which is known for its violence, while according to your own version you never followed that procedure in interrogations or even heard of anybody who did so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Mr Chairman, let me help you I was not working in the passage, I had an office but this is the passage I used to walk when I wanted access to my office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Maybe like staying "Bloedstraat" for instance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I'm sorry I didn't hear your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I said, it may be like staying in "Bloedstraat" for instance, Blood Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I am grateful for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a>	I want to put it to you that Violent Street was named as such as a result of most of the assaults that took place, either occurred in that passage or in the offices leading off that passage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I did not know, I was a warrant officer.  As a person I would never allow people to be assaulted in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Tell me, is the office that you worked in was it sound proofed at any stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> What do you mean Sir, when you say it had sound absorbers?  What does that mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> What I mean is that if someone had been in the office, had been assaulted in the office had been screaming, that somebody outside the office could not have heard it.  That's what I mean by sound proof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I would hear Sir, I would be in a position to hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> The day when you were working there, did you hear any screams?</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Yes, I would see then and I would even hear the sounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> You never employed or used that method to compel the detainees to talk, did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No, we did not force them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Do you agree that to make somebody do physical exercises does not necessarily boil down to assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> You're right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> And there is no method that it can be linked to the person who gave the instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> You say it was a method of interrogation to make people do physical exercises?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Would it help in persuading people to co-operate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> No. Only the cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you know Mr White Mohape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did he have a file?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> I believe so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you see when he was brought in time and again for questioning or interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> When I was present I would see when he was brought in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Let me rather leave that question.  I want to put it to you Mr Tsoametsi, that on that day you did participate in the assault on the group of 19 persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> That is not so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I want to put it to you further that the reason why you are denying it today is because you know that you yourself, that you can possibly incriminate yourself because you have not applied for amnesty in this regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOAMETSI:</span> Sir, that is not so.  I'm telling you that every black man you was there worked with a white person so we'd not ask one - we'd not interrogate one person, the four of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I thank you, I have no more questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STANDER</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, I have been going through the bundle A, the evidence and it appears that it does not contain the evidence in chief of Mr Ngo in this aspect and I intend relying on the record in cross examining this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a>     Now we are also generally not ready on other aspects to cross-examine this witness and we ask that his cross examination stand down until tomorrow. Hopefully by then we'll have found a copy of Mr Ngo's evidence in chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a>    Are you looking at bundle A, Mr Chairman?  You know if you look at the page 126, that is the end of Mr Venter and at page 128 ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, 128 is the hearing on the 25th of May.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Yes.  There I continue saying - as the Chair please Mr Chairman, I'm indebted to the Committee for the indulgence granted to me earlier on. We are now going to proceed with the evidence of Mr Ngo.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a>"Mr Ngo, we had come to the point where I indicated that we had completed the evidence on Mr Mohapi's abduction, iss there anything you'd like to add regarding Mr Mohapi to the particulars"?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a>		"The evidence I gave, that's sufficient".</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a>Now, there is 127 is blank and don't who whether it constituted the entire evidence in chief of Mr Ngo on Mohapi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But at the end of 126 the Committee adjourns till 8 o'clock the next morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> The point I'm making is that before then we are dealing with Mr Venter only and there's nothing on Mr Mohapi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If I may assist, Mr Chairman, bundle - the record A2, which you refer to as A2 at page 29, Mr Chairman.  It's slightly below the middle of the page and it runs on to ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I don't know how far it runs on, but that's White Mohape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's on the 14th of May?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, I apparently there are some exhibits we do not have. If you're looking - If it forms part of - does it form part of bundle A?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> That's a document which we do not have, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How could it come about that everybody else apparently has this document and you haven't?</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> It has happened quite often, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Isn't your attorney supposed to be responsible for obtaining the documents and briefing you with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I think, Mr Chairman, we can get what gets passed on to us.  From time to time we get suprised to find that our learned friends are referring to documents which we have not been favoured ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But this is not a document, this is a copy of the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why doesn't your attorney obtain it for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Well, Mr Chairman ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why didn't he obtain it for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I don't think he's even aware of its existence, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I find that hard to believe.  He knows that there was a record been kept of each day's proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> What we have in the form of a record of proceedings Mr Chairman, is what is contained in bundle A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I think the reason why there is, is it A2 or whatever, which is supposed to be part of the record contained in bundle A, I think there was something wrong with the record as compiled in Exhibit A, particularly towards its end or from the middle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a>    And I think that is why that extra package was introduced. It may be that you like some of us, you remained with the imperfect bundle A, which is imperfect somewhere from the middle or towards the end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a>    They could not coincide, I do recall, I may be wrong, but I do recall that Visser came with a copy which was not entirely in harmony with what we had been furnished, the transcript that we had been furnished, I think that could explain the inconsistency.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a>    But I don't think that there were enough copies made available of the portion that was brought by Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say you want an adjournment until tomorrow morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> A standing down of the witness, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you carry on with someone else Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, Mr Miningwa has arrived and his cross-examination can now be completed, with your leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a>	Mr Tsoametsi, you're excused. Mr Tsoametsi, you're excused until later.</p>

<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> ...[inaudible] got a note Mr Chairman, was a reference to the house of the parents of Citi Mzuzwana. It was put to the witness you knew of both Siti and his parents home and the answer was no. And then was the adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, it was put that there was a sub-file in the file, sub file dealing with the other burning which was put to him - that was put to him that he knew both because there was a sub-file in the file and he said no he didn't know about it, he didn't read about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a>    Right, Mr Memani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MEMANI:</span> As the Chair pleases.  Now, Mr Minimgwa you worked with churches as well, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And that evidence was lead by Mr Motsamai spontaneously without connecting you to any incident, at page 640 of the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a>    Now, you accompanied Mr Motsamai when he went to bomb the church in Boshabelo, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I know nothing of such an incident, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was it the church or the pastor's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, when I refer to the church, I usually am referring to the parish house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja, I think it may create the wrong impression with the public and people hearing that a church has been bombed so perhaps we should stick to the correct description.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> As the Chair pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a>    I beg your pardon, Mr Chairman, I made a summary here but there's something wrong with the notes. May I have a moment to try and work out what I was doing here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, let me be of assistance Mr Chairman.  There's no evidence at all before you implicating this witness in that attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a>    Perhaps in the mean time, to be of assistance, -    - please stop me if I'm talking too much, Mr Chairman. you can refer to the application of Mr Motsamai at page 148, paragraph 12 and you will recall that Mr Ngo did not apply for amnesty with regard to any such incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, I was referring to the wrong part of my notes, Mr Chairman.  The part which I wish to put to Mr Miningwa was that he was present when the clinic of Winnie Mandela was bombed, in fact the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're putting that to him on the basis of the evidence of whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman this is - there is a problem Mr Chairman because Mr Motsamai seems not to agree with me on this aspect and I'm trying to find the relevant passage on the record, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, please stop me if I'm not being of assistance.  It is paragraph - I've got a reference here in Exhibit P30 which mentions the name of Mr Miningwa and it's at page 158 of Bundle A.  I've got a reference here first to the clinic of Winnie Mandela and that's the only reference in regard to anything about Mrs Winnie Mandela, referring to Mr Miningwa, so it's a reference to the clinic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where's this, do you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> My note here in Exhibit P30 says page 158 of bundle A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> My bundle A finishes at page 148.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Maybe a typing error, Mr Chairman, may I just check that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, Mr Miningwa is referred to at page 655 of the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> This relates to the bombing of the clinic, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Kindly repeat the page again, page?</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> 655.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a>    Now Mr Miningwa, Mr Motsamai led evidence that you accompanied him to Brandfort when he went to bomb the clinic of Mrs Mandela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I know nothing of that incident, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> He told us that he was with you and Mamome.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I know nothing of that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And he also told us that you were supposed to keep watch on any people who might approach the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I know nothing Sir, about that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> He also told us that when there was an explosion he saw you nearby and you were scared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I know nothing of this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now Mr Miningwa, when you heard that Mr Motsamai was implicating you in this matter, what steps did you take to gather evidence that could escalpate you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> It was was not necessary to look for something I'd not know.  Where would I look for evidence to rescue myself because I was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a>    What I can tell you about this is that I heard that such an incident took place, a house or a clinic of Winnie was burnt, not that I took part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a>     I know nothing and it was not necessary therefor to gather evidence to come and convince that I did not do any thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> There are no differences between yourself and Mr Motsamai, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And on the other hand, you have not applied for amnesty, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> No, I don't remember applying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Miningwa, my experience with people who are falsely implicating others is that they are usually minimise their participation in an incident, and here Mr Motsamai attributes himself an active role and yours is relatively minor and somewhat passive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I am suprised Sir, that my name is included, I was not working with Motsamai.  The people he was working with, even the white men he was working with I do not see around here.  He mentioned to me and I was far away from him, this is really suprising.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Do you, by any chance recall any incident where you were in a Kombi with Morakile and Mtyhala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> If I was not using Mr Prinsloo's car  at the time - we had one transport, it was a Kombi and all of us would get into a Kombi and be dropped off at our respective homes.  I do not know which occasion you are referring to because if I was not working at night, not using Prinsloo's car, I would get into a Kombi with my colleagues to drop me off at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now Mr Miningwa, I may have asked you the question, pardon me if I have, were you present on the occasion when Motsamai and others went to Pretoria to consult with an attorney?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I was not there, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And did you give a full statement on the day when you went to consult?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> About the incident that I saw on that page where it is alleged that I took part, I gave evidence, full evidence.  Some of them that might have cropped up there after, I do not know but those who were mentioned, and I saw them on the paper, I gave evidence to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, at the time you went to consult, you must have become aware that it was alleged that you were present in 19 pupils were interrogated and assaulted at Bloemfontein Fountains.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I remember well.  Mzuzwana's home was mentioned, Mrs. Mandela's clinic was mentioned  Other incidents I did not see them where my name is  mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a>    If I remember well, I heard when we were sitting at the Education Center where Oupa Makubalo said I was present but on the paper I did not see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a>    He said on that day I was on the 5th, 4th floor and I quoted him. It does not appear on the papers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Did you approach your attorneys?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Sir, it was not necessary.  I expected that he would ask me when I'm sitting here on the witness box because in my main evidence there are no allegations at all.  It only appeared when they were asked about the incidents that took place at Fountain.  I really expected you to ask me here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I just want to make sure if Ngo does not refer to you in his list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Page 30, person number eleven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Yes.  Now your name is referred to on page 30 of bundle A as being one of the people who were present when Oupa Makubalo, Baba Kuzela, Minas and others were tortured at Fountains.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> It's my first time to hear of that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But Mr Miningwa, you must have seen your attorneys and they must have put it to you that you have been implicated by Ngo as a person was present during the torture which took place on the 6th of April 1986 at Fountains.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Unfortunately Sir, I did not know, I only know of two allegations.  The others I heard when the applicants were testifying as I am doing now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Did you at any stage tell your legal representatives what your version was going to be in this hearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a>    Can you repeat that question Sir, I didn't catch it very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Did you at any stage tell your legal representatives what your version was going to be at these hearings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I think I gave them the statement, Sir. They told me that Motsamai implicates me on this issue, then I gave them a statements and I said: "That's Motsomi's version, I know nothing about that incident.  I think they know what I was going to say today but they don't know exactly what I was going to say as I'm sitting here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> That cannot be true.  How could it be true, that's the way attorneys work.  A client comes in and says that: "I'm not guilty" and the attorney wants to know why you say you're not guilty of what you're being accused of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Sir, I do not know how are you asking me this question because I gave a statement before the attorneys.  The first day when I sit here, he led evidence told me that you've been implicated on this and this point and now I do not know what are you actually asking me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You see the only reason why your attorneys did not take any statement about what you're going to say here would be that you did not have any proper instructions to give to them at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm going to have to object here, Mr Chairman.  Frankly, I don't even follow the line of the cross examination.  But with all due respect to this witness that there isn't an affidavit before you because he didn't give my attorney instructions, is ridiculous, with respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a>    We've explained to you at the time that the allegations started proliferating, there were more and more pieces of would be application papers that came to light, Mr Chairman, and we said on record to you that we've now reached the point where it doesn't - make any - where there's no point at all in filing further affidavits, we will have to call all the witnesses because otherwise we would have to keep amending the affidavits all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a>    With respect, Mr Chairman, my learned friend's questions, his statements which he's putting to the witness are unfair in the extreme.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, these allegations are contained in the application in its original form before Mr Ngo testified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well Mr Chairman, if my learned friend is through, can I try to refresh your memory about what happened with Mr Ngo's application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a>    You will recall that on the first occasion, when we arrived here Mr Chairman, there was only one incident that he had applied for amnesty for and that was murder, robbery and the illegal possession of a firearm with regard to the Venter murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a>    Thereafter there was - bundle C page eight came to light and we didn't know - bundle C page eight, Mr Chairman, and nobody knew what the status of this document was you will remember very well.   And eventually Mr Chairman this lead to a point, an item placed on the agenda of a pre-trial conference that we had to agree was what the application of Mr Ngo in the end really consisted of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a>    And at that stage we conceded that you can take it for granted that page 8, 9, 10, 11, up to 14 was also part of the application.  The only point I'm making is originally there was no question about anything other than Mr Venter, that's what we came to Bloemfomntein for in the first place, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a>    So my learned friend's statement is factually incorrect.  And thereafter, you will recall, there was another 30 pages or whatever that came to light and we even conceded that those also would form part of the application, on the basis that Mr Ngo said to you in his evidence that he gave all these papers to the TRC. And we said well let's be fair to the man, consider it all to be part of the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a>    But it's not correct to say that originally when consultations were held with the witnesses we knew exactly what he was going to say, we knew about Venter, that's all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, the legal representatives of the people who are objecting might have raised the legal argument about whether or not the rest of the incidents formed part of the application but the factual allegations were contained in both documents that were submitted on behalf of Mr Ngo.  So these allegations were already known to Mr Visser and Mr Wagner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Wasn't there a dispute about two applications, and whether the documents were included in the first application and then we all agreed in the long end that we would take both applications because it might have been mislaid, that he did send it in and it might have been mislaid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> What I'm doing here, Mr Chairman, I'm referring you to the bundle, I'm saying look at both applications that are submitted by Mr Motsamai.  They contain facts on most of the applications that he's made and Mr Visser and Mr Wagner chose to raise a dispute about whether the rest of incidents formed part of his application.  Now that was a legal argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a>	My understanding is that a lawyer whose faced with such a situation prepares all the facts as well, Mr Motsamai was already making the allegations.  He did not make the allegations against - as far as Mr Venter only is concerned.  Throughout he spoke of the rest of the incidents which are contained again in the second, what we call the second application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a>    Mr Visser cannot be heard to say that at that stage he didn't consult on the rest of the allegations because he wanted to raise, would I say a point in limine that they were not properly before this Court, before this forum.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr Visser, just to enable myself to follow, the witness has not made an affidavit, is that what it's all about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, this witness has made an affidavit. I'm not sure what the point is here but I - as much as I can gather Mr Commissioner, is that it's being put to the witness that in his original affidavit he didn't deal with all the allegations and with all the incidents which are now before you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a>	You will see at page 100 of bundle D, you will find the affidavit of Mr Miningwa.  And he deals here in paragraph 2.2, were he says:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a>"Specifically I took note of certain allegations which implicated me".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a>then he goes to over to ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Isn't' the problem Mr Visser, that the affidavit you are reading there relates to amnesty application of Mr Motsamai, not to Mr Ngo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the point that Mr Memani is trying to make is that he hasn't dealt with the allegations in Ngo's application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It's not in dispute, we never gave you an affidavit for him in regard to Mr Ngo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, that's the point Mr Memani is seeking to make. That is you had told your attorneys about it they would have filed an affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, but my learned friend can't ignore the evidence which is on record Mr Chairman, where we told you that there is a proliferation of incidents now that there's going to be no point of filing affidavits, we will give the evidence viva voce, that's exactly what we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But that surely Mr Chairman, would have occured after Motsomi, after affidavits relating to Motsomi were filed.  When we first came here in May, or in March, the only person before the Committee was Ngo,  Motsamai came in later and there was no proliferation at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, the point Mr Visser makes is that when they came here first it was first it was to oppose the application in respect of Venter, the murder of Mr Venter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> What I'm saying, Mr Chairman, is that cannot be true from a working point of view because there were applications, there were factual allegations already made by Ngo at that stage.  And that my understanding is that if you are sitting with a situation we you want to take a point that legally something is not before forum, you do not then not even consult with clients to deal with people who are implicated, to deal those allegations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a>    What was raised was something amounting to a point in limine.  His name was mentioned in the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I would like to try to be of assistance so that we can cut this short.  Could my learned friend just inform you and me in regard to which incident this cross-examination does now deal - which incident is it which he expected Mr Miningwa to have made an affidavit about in regard to Mr Ngo because we're not certain what he's referring to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you reply to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, at the present moment I'm dealing with what you referred to, that was at page 30 - A30</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a>"Members of the security branch who were present who organised, were organised by Kenneth Coetzee and Colonel Stephenson to beat up and torture with number eleven Miningwa"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well you see Mr Chairman, that's the, really, with all due respect, that's the point.  That document, as you know very well, became available only later Mr Chairman, it wasn't even part of the papers on the first occasion that came out later.   On the first occasion Mr Chairman, what you had was an application form, form 1 and then there was a document, the status of which was obscure from pages 8 to 14 of bundle C.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a>    The other pages only came later, with all due respect.  And what is more Mr Chairman, is even if pages 8 to 14 should've or ought to have been regarded by us as an application as it stood, as an application for amnesty, Mr Miningwa is not implicated there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a>    And I would challenge my learned friend to tell us where he is implicated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> The problem Mr Chairman, Mr Visser can't run away from it, the problem Mr Chairman is that he's client says that he was never told about this incident, he only heard about it at the hearings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a>    And I'm saying that during consultation, he's legal representatives would have put these passages to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They should perhaps have they may not you could comment and use that as argument.  He has said it wasn't put to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But at this stage I'm taking it through him and we are going by his evidence that he was not told about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, he said that right you've got that one, let's go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> As the chair pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a>    Now, I'm putting it to you that the only reason why your attorneys would not take instructions - would not take your version on this issue, would be that you did not have any proper instructions to give them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I don't think that is a question which would direct to me.   I did not know about that, it's not my work maybe to know what I did not know. I only learnt it from here, then I set out only reply there as we were.  It was spoken before the Commission, I didn't know about it before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a>    It didn't appear on the allegations.  I only know about two allegations, and that's what I've put on my statement. I only learnt about other allegations here. I thought that  I would reply to those allegations when I appeared before this Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And did you become aware that - I'll leave this matter then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[indaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The interpreter cannot hear the speaker.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> One can argue just as much that he should have done so.  There are all sorts of technical aspects of that nature which you can mention during argument and I'm sure other people will also mention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I'm sure, Mr Chairman, I'll be able to distinguish Motsamai from Miningwa in this regard Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a>    If I may take instructions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, you know Citi Mzuzwana,isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> I know him very well, I know him very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And you've already told us that he a trade unionist and you were working with trade unions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And his house later got bombed, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> I received such a report then I went verify, then I found it to be that the big window was broken and that curtains seemed to be burned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, Mr Motsamai has told us that you participated in that petrol bombing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> I'm suprised.  If he would be reminded that the time when he - when he made his statement, he could have written first that I was there in that incident.   It's nowhere where he said I was  present he only say I was present at Mzuzwana's parent's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a>    That is why I told this Commission that I know for the first time that Mzuzwana's house was burnt.  I only know of Citi Mzuzwana's house then later I went to find out and verify as whether is it true.  I learnt that from my informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And, by the way when I say Citi's, when I said Citi's, I meant Citi's parental home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well that's a different building, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Yes, Mr Chair, I'm sorry I was not precise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a>	Now, can we get clarity now, can we get certainty about your answer.  Mr Motsamsai told us that you were present when  Citi Mzuzwana's parental home was petrol bombed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> As I said, that I learnt here in this hearing about Citi Mzuzwana's parental home, I didn't know about that before.  When I received those allegations, I knew that Citi's parent's home was burned.  I only learnt about Citi's house which I went to verify, then I found that it was true, it was burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Subject to correction, on Friday you told us that ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I think Mr Memani whether you were present when Citi's parent's house was bombed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> Mr Chairperson, I replied and say I did not know, I was not present.  That is why I said I found that allegation for the first time when I saw Motsamai's allegations.  I said I didn't know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, if I remember correctly, on Friday you told us that you where sent to go and have a look at Citi Mtswana's house because you worked with Citi. Isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> I didn't say that, I did not say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> What was the reason why you were sent to go and have a look at the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> It may me come clearly, I don't know as whether you talk about Citi's parent's house or Citi's house.  I went to see Citi's house, not Citi's parents house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a>    I went to his house after I learnt about that from my informer, then my immediate superior said when I made a report about about hearing from the informer about that incident, he said I should go and verify as whether the house was burnt.  That is Citi's house, not Citi's parent's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And I was putting it to you that my recollection is that you said your superior sent you to go and have a look because you were working with Citi, Citi was in your profile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> I was not working with Citi, you speak as if he was my colleague.  Because he was an activist in the trade unions, I was working - he was my suspect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I menat to say ...[Sotho - no translation] it's unfortunate that it came in a different way in Sotho to  you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said he was working with Citi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> As the Chair pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a>    Now, you said that your superior sent you because you were working about Citi, maybe you should use that word.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, he said it was because he was his suspect, Mr Chairman. I don't understand "working with" either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I don't think it makes a difference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, with respect, it does Mr Chairman. He's placing words in the mouth of the witness which the witness hasn't testified to and that's unfair.  And I just don't see the point in it because it's just wasting time, with all due respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a>    He says Citi was his suspect, why can't we just stick to that, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And you told us that your superior told you to go and have a look at the house because you were working about Citi, Citi was one of the persons you were working about, you were investigating or whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I object.  This witness did not say so Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well the indication I got was that he certainty was investigating him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's the point, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that's what he said, that he was investigating him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That he was working about him doesn't ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then Mr Memani corrected it and said: "investigating".  So let's not have these objections, objections, objections.  Carry on Mr Memani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Did you hear the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> I have a problem about Mr Memani's question because I don't know what he is looking for. He was saying I was working about Citi, if he can give me a clearer explanation about that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright, let's start again, Citi, you have told us was one of the trade unionists and activists in whom the security branch were obviously interested, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> Those are my words.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and for that reason your superior told you to go and verify whether this information you had received from an informer was true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And you kept a sub-file on Citi's Mzuzwana's parental home, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> I don't know about the file concerning his parents, I only know about Citi Mzuzwana's file.</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But on Friday when I put it to you that there was a sub-file on Citi Mzuzwana's parents, you conceded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> My note is that he said he did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Oh, I beg your pardon Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a>	Now, Mr Miningwa, you are denying that you had any knowledge of Citi Mzuzwana's parental home sub-file because you were present when Mr Motsamai petrol- bombed that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> I know nothing about Mzuzwana's parents sub-file.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you present when their house was petrol-bombed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> I explained Sir, clearly, that I know nothing about the house of Mzuzwana's parents when it was petrol-bombed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, this will be my last question but it seems there's some instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a>    Now, my instructions are that you never investigated Citi Mzuzwana's parental house, no, Citi Mzuzwana's house, because security branch did not do anything about the matter and it was left in the hands of the CID.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> I hear that for the first time, I learn that for the first time.  I was given an instruction to verify as to whether is it Citi's own house which has been burnt as the informer has said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> My instructions are that the matter was referred to CID.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He never said he investigated it, he went to the place and he said he saw the big window was broken and it looked as if the curtain had been burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> May I proceed Mr Chair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a>    And that did not go there because you were investigating Mzuzwana as such, because it was known that security branch had done it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> Maybe he knows that he burnt the house but at that time as I was working with the trade trade unions, we did not know that the security branch bombed Citi's own house.  That is why my senior said I should go there and verify as to whether that house is burnt or not.  Maybe he knows that he is the one who is responsible for the burning of that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, tell me, you knew that files were kept of certain people who were involved in political activities, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> They were there, they were not stored, they were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> When these allegations were made, why didn't you take the trouble of going and looking at the files and see what Motsamai is talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> I want to say, may you please repeat your question because I don't understand your question as to whether they were kept now more or they were kept them.  But I say then they were there, I'm not sure whether they now are kept or stored.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You told us that you had a file on Citi Mzuzwana, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And Mr Motsamai alleges that Citi Mzuzwana's home was burnt and you know about that one isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> Yes, about Citi's old home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> He also mentions the burning of his parental house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> That is correct.  As you say, I learnt that for the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And he says he did that during the course of his duties as a member of the security branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> I learnt that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And did you not know anything about the bombing of the house of the the parental home of Citi Mzuzwana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> I know nothing about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And my question is, why don't you take steps to verify like going to the office ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because this is 13 years ago and he says he doesn't know if the files are there.  Do you think files of incidents 13 years ago to still be kept in the office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a>    And how long ago Mr Memani, was it when you said this is my last question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> As the Chair pleases. I did not hear him to say that he did not know ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said it a few minutes ago that he didn't know if the files were still there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a>	Didn't you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIMINGWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I thought at that stage, Mr Chairman, there was some problem with the interpretation, there was keeping and storing and so on and that that is why I stopped using the word: "keep" and I used the word "had".</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a>    If Mr Chairman, you could allow me to ask the</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a>question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I think Mr Memani, what do you expect him to find in the file, what must he go and look for in the file?</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Chairman, I would expect him to go for instance and look the file and say there was no such file for instance, because he says he did not know anything about a file kept by the Mzuzwana's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a>    If it's an incident that he knows nothing at all about when in fact he was working with Citi Mzuzwana I would have expected him to have gone and had a look and see if there was anything perhaps in the nature of a sub-file kept about Mzuzwana's parents or whether they had a political profile of their own that justified Motsamai going to bomb that house in the course of duty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You may carry on like the chairperson has said.  I don't quite appreciate what you should go and look for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> As the chair pleases, I will leave the matter there.  I have no further questions Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MEMANI</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No re-examinations Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And when did you become a member of the security branch in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> I came here in 1985 in June.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> June '85.  Which section did you work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> I was working under church section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And who was your commanding officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> My commanding officer was Attie Coetzee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who were the other members of the security branch in the church section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> I was together with Coetzee, Shaw, Erasmus, L.D. Koch, P.A.C Koch, Cronje, N. Killian, Mamome, Motsamai and myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I think you went a little bit quickly, can you just perhaps repeat it?  It was Coetzee, Shaw, Erasmus, Killian, and then you said Koch twice, were there two Kochs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> Yes there are two, it's  L.D. Gogh and P.A.C. Gogh.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Killian, Mamome and Motsomai, are those all the members of that section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> That is correct. I forgot about Mr Ramosoeu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Ramosoeu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> R - a - m - o - s - o - e - u, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> Yes, it is written that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In 1985/86 more or less how many members in total were there attached to the security branch here in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> Approximately 60 to 70 or above.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As far as the allegations against you are concerned, that you acted unlawfully or illegally, what do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> To those things I would say I know nothing and I haven't done anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you take part in the kidnapping and assault of Mr White Mohape?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you attack ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Before going to the other one, isn't it common cause now that this is Citi's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I believe so, Mr Chairman, but I understood last time that there was some confusion. I filed a reference on the record, it's page 375, but I'm immediately going to put him if he admits that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a>    Did you have anything to do with the attack on the parental home of Mr Citi Mzuzwana?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> Not at all Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you know anything and did you take part in the attack on the clinic of Mrs Winnie Mandela?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> No Sir. I didn't play any role in the attack of Mrs Winnie Mandela's house or clinic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you participate in an attack on the vehicle of Mr Jannie Mohape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Or the burning of the minibus of Mr Elijah Mohape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> No Sir, I don't even know that mini bus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Ngo gave evidence regarding a UDF activist called JJ or Papie, whom he says was murdered in 1986.  Do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> No Sir. I learnt that a certain UDF member has been murdered. I didn't play any role in that, I didn't even know that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now, were you present - am I going too fast, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a>	Were you present when Oupa Makubalo was arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> No Sir, I was not present.  I went to Smithfield, then I learnt later that he has been arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You heard the evidence here that a vehicle arrived and people shot at him and he was arrested in King street I think it was, that's the incident I'm referring to.  Do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> What I know is that he has been arrested in relation to Motsamai's informer's murder.  I don't know, I just heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that person, the informer, was Mr Khoze, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In 1986 there was a group of 19 persons who were transferred from Ladybrand to Bloemfontein and who were interrogated here in Bloemfontein.  Did you have anything to do with those 19 detainees?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> I only saw those people in the offices. When I enquired, I learned that they were arrested because they tried to skip the country.  I did have a role because I was not in that section, I was in the church section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It is also correct that at one stage or another you took some of those people to Glen Police Station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> Yes, I helped because they did not have enough people to help the drivers to take them to the police station so I did take part in the transfer of those people to Glen Police Station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you remember on what ground they were detained at Glen Police Station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> If I remember, I remember that they were arrested because they tried to skip the country and that was illegal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But when you entered them in the occurrence book - let me ask you, were these people that you took to Glen, were their names entered into whatever the relevant book is in Glen Police Station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> Yes, that is correct.  Like any other person who has been arrested, their names were entered in the relevant books.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what I'm asking you is, on what grounds were they held there, can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> It is because they were trying to skip the country when they were arrested by the soldiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  It was suggested that you were told by Tsoametsi, T-s-o-a-m-e-t-s-i and Ramosoeu, R-a-m-a-s-o-e-u, that you and Ngo should bring water and that you should force the comrades to drink two bottles of water each.  Is there any truth in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> That is not true, there was no such command to such kind of a thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that you participated in forcing those arrested persons to do frog jumps, push-ups and high jump exercises?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> No Sir, I didn't even ask them anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, let's cut this short.  Did you participate at all in any assault on any of these people and did you and/or did you see anybody assault them in your presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> I did not take part and again I did not see any person assaulting those people in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Lastly, it has been suggested that you also took part in the beating up and torturing of a large group of comrades which was arrested and taken to Botshabelo Police Station.  What do you say of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> That is not true, I did not even go to Botshabelo. I was not even working in Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I said lastly and I was incorrect., I should have turned the page Mr Chairman, I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a>    You were also implicated by Mr Motsamai in an attack or a petrol bomb attack on a house belonging to Nicos. Is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> That is a lie. I did not take part in that attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And Mr Motsamai - I'm sorry, I should perhaps give you the references Mr Chairman, instead of keeping it to myself, it's page 146 of bundle A, paragraph four and that is Mr Motsamai.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a>	And at page 147 of the same bundle, paragraph 10, it is alleged that you participated in the petrol bomb attack on the house of a teacher called Bolosha - B-o-l-s-h-a.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> I don't know that person, I don't even know his house. I did not take part in that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just in case, there are two further incidents, the one we have already spoken about, the arrest of Oupa Makubalo, but then there was also a petrol bomb attack - that's item twelve, Mr Chairman at page 148.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a>	A petrol bomb attack on the parish house in Botshabelo, did you have anything to do with that if that happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> No, I did not take part in that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm sorry, Mr Chairman, I just cannot recall whther its this witness or the previous witness that I've asked about Oupa Makubalo.  My attorney seems to think I did ask this witness about him but I really cannot recall, I'm sorry.  Well, let me just ...[intervention]</p>

Mr Mtyhala, I've been instructed to put it to you that you have indeed participated in the torturing of the group of 19 here in Bloemfontein.  That was on sixth of April 1986.  What is your reaction to this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> No, that is just an allegation, I did not do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> A role which you specifically played consisted of you having the women in particular drink water. thus to intimidate them in order to gain their co-operation. What is your reaction to this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> There's nothing like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I also wish to state to you that the reason why you deny this is because of the fact that you have not applied for amnesty and that is why today you are forced to deny this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTYHALA:</span> I'm not deny this thing. I did not do that.  I haven't done anything, if I did anything I could have applied for amnesty.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Haven't you perhaps forgotten, because he tells me that he used to sleep at your place at times?</p>

We were in the kitchen, Motsamai arrived and he requested our assistance, he said he got  information that the person who killed his informer is somewhere in Bochabela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a>    We got into the Kombi and we left for Bochabela, it was in the afternoon. When we arrived at Botshabela, the Kombi stopped.  Oupa Makubalo started running away, then we got out of the Kombi to chase him.  I think the second house from the corner, he got into that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a>    We jumped the fences.  I could not catch hem but Sergeant Mamome caught him and then we took him back to the office.</p>

I don't think we need about driving to Bochabela, but what happened when they got to Botshabel.  If we could have it repeated a little more slowly please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, Mr Morakile, I would ask you to perhaps speak a little more slowly so the interpreter has time to hear what you say and to interpret it.  Do you understand?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just stop for a moment please.  Don't refer to Boyzi, let's stick to Motsamai.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> That's correct, thank you.  Motsamai got out of the Kombi because he knew, he's the person who knew Oupa Makubalo.  When Oupa started running, he shot after Oupa, then he took the other direction and then we got out of the car and chasde after him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you remember who many times he shot after Oupa, as you put it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I do not remember, but it was several times, it might be three if not four.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you in the vicinity when Sergeant Mamome arrested Oupa Makubalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> No, I was at the back, I was not any close to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you see anybody assault Mr Makubalo on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I didn't see anyone Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's the evidence in chief Mr Chairman, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> No questions for the witness, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR DU PLESSIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR STANDER:</span> Mr Morakile, are you sure that in June of 86 was the first time you reported for duty at the security police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> That is true Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Were you involved at an earlier stage here at the security police in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Why I'm putting this question to you is because I was instructed that you were the person who interrogated Mildred Lekethlani as being one of the group of 19 who was arrested at Ladybrand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Which date are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> 6th of April 86.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I arrived at the security branch on the 21st of June 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> She can also recall it specifically as as a fact that you were the person who hit her with your open hand.  What do you have to say in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I would not have slapped him in my absence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I want to put it to you that you are trying to keep yourself away from the scene, while at that stage you were involved with the security police to some or other extent here in Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you came to Bloemfontein and got involved with the security police you were ...[inaudible]?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you keep a pocket book in those days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And when it's full you hand it in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That should be available should'nt it, from Wepener, Wepener Police Station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I believe so Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I can even help.  My record, the SAP record in 1986 will show with whom did I leave Wepener to come to Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a>	In the light of the arres of Oupa Makubalo, did you see whether Sergeant Mamome fired any shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I did not see him at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did he get out of the vehicle, I'm now referring to Mamome?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Yes, he got out of the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you watch him the whole time, from the time he got out of the car until he returned with Oupa Makubalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He just told you he didn't see him at all, hasn't he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> ...[inaudible] fired the shots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Can you repeat your question, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> From the moment he climbed out of the car until he returned with Makubalo, did you see anything?  Did you see him at all, I'm now referring to Mamome?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I did not see him when he arrested him, when he caught him. I just saw them coming, approaching.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Is there a possibility that he could have fired shots which you did not see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I don't believe he shot.  At that time we went out of the car, chased after him, he did not shoot. But when we were obscured I didn't see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did any of your other people fire any shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I did not see anyone shooting except Motsamai.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Do you know what I find very strange, I'm going to give you an opportunity to reply to this. Motsamai came to apply for amnesty and he's the only one who shot, who fired any shots.  The others did not fire any shots while they were on the same course to arrest Makubalo.  I do not understand that, please give us some clarity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Let me explain this to you.  This person was deeply hurt because his informer was killed, he might have done that.  He was supposed to do that because the person he was working with was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you see Mr Makubalo when he was brought back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Yes, we came with him in the Kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you notice any blood on his face?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Not at all, I did not see blood at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Because I was instructed to put it to you that his front tooth had either been hit out or kicked out on that occasion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I did not see that, truly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> If one's tooth has been hit out or kicked out the normally it bleeds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> And can you give us a reason, if this is so, why there was no blood?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I did not see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you look at him at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Yes, we left Bochabela with him, we came to Fountain.  He was there, I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> You could see his face very clearly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I was looking at him just as I am looking at you now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> And that is why I find it strange that you saw no marks or injuries or blood on his face.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> He did not have blood on his face.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I put it to you that the only reason why you are denying this is because you are trying to protect people whom you know have acted wrongly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> That is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I have no further questions thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STANDER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MEMANI:</span> As the chair pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a>	Now, Mr Morakile, you are also known as Molefe, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Yes, it appeared like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> People who referred to you as Molefe said they were assaulted on the 6th of April 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can that question be repeated please Mr Chairman, I didn't hear it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> The people who referred to you as Molefe said that they were assaulted on the 6th of April 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I already said that I would not assault a person once I was absent.  On the 6th of April 1986, I was not in Bloemfontein but in Wepener. I already told you that I came to Bloemfontein on the 21st of June 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You see my instructions are that there was a person called Kaya and Mopena at security branch who worked there without been registered as members of the security branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I know the two of them, they were working there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And Ngo at some stage worked there without being registered as a member of the security branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I only knew that he was a recruit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And there was also a Bester who worked there without being registered as a member of the the security branch.  Before you make the note, let me find the correction on the name.  Yes, it's confirmed Bester. Do you know Bester?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Is that a white person?  I only know one Bester who was a captain.  He left when he was a major.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Yes, that is the one.  I'm told that for a long time he worked with security branch without being registered as a member of security branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I don't know, surely.  I arrived there being a police and with other police. As whether he was registered or not I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And I'm instructed for some time Motsamai used to see you being brought by Mamome without knowing exactly where you worked and you'd worked together with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> He was with you when you went to bomb the house of Nicos, he was with you when you went to burn - to bomb the house of Winnie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I haven't worked with Motsamai, I didn't go there. I would not even participate in the bombing of that house once I was absent.  That house was bombed in 1985 I said I came in 1986 in Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a>    It would not be possible to go and bomb that house in my absence because at that time in 1985 I did not know anything about the branch because I was not connected with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Motsamai concedes that it is possible that you may have been working with the stock theft unit because at that stage you never used to be at the office, but Mr Mamome would come with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Whilst I was in Wepener, I was not working with the security police.  I did not even know Mr Mamome.  I started to know these people when I started to work at Bloemfontein security police. I didn't have any association with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, Mr Morakile, when you went to arrest Oupa, you told us that you saw Mr Mamome and others come back with Morakile, with Oupa rather.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Mamome's the one who has caught him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Do you know that when Mr Makubalo is being chased, some of the policemen when on the one side of the house and some went on the other side of the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And it appears to me that you did not catch up with them, you could not keep up with the pace.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And although you heard gunfire, you couldn't see actually where it was fired from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> The first one I saw him shooting is Motsamai, is Boyzi, I saw him.  After that when they were obscured I heard a gunshot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Motsamai then tells us that at that stage he heard gun  - at some stage he heard people firing from one side but he didn't see who it was that was firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I didn't hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Well you've just said that you heard gunfire but we'll proceed.  Now, ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I spoke about what, I spoke about gunfire from Motsamai.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I'm talking about the gunfire that you could hear from the distance but you didn't see who was shooting at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I didn't hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying that you did not hear any gunshots other than the gunshots that you saw Mr Motsamai ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER::</span> The interpreters cannot hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying you did not hear any other gunshots other than the shots you heard when you saw Mr Motsamai firing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But just a few moments ago I put it to you that you were left behind and gunfire continued and at that stage you couldn't see who was shooting. And your answer was yes, the only person - you saw Motsamai only who was the first to shoot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Let me put it in this way: When Motsamai get off the car, he started shooting then he turned on the house, they were following Oupa and from there I did not hear gunfire again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> The interpretation that came through to us was that you said that after these people were obscured, after they got obscured again and you didn't see them, you did hear some shots being fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Maybe I did not understand the question correctly.  I said ended up gunfire after Motsamai was chasing Oupa, maybe I did not understand the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And from there you did not hear any other gunfire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Not at all, I didn't hear any gunfire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Where was Motsamai when he was shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> The Kombi was on the street, when he entered the yard - he started shooting when he entered the yard.  From the Kombi he shot at Oupa's direction, then he stopped shooting, then we entered into the yard, then he went around the house, then we jumped the fence and then we chased Oupa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, how many times did he shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> It would be three to four times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Was it at the stage when he was in the vicinity of the vehicle when he shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You must be mistaken because Mr Makubalo said throughout the time that he was being chased. He pressed there were shots being fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> It might be those I've mentioned because Motsamai shot into his direction, he heard those gunfires.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> He told us that he ran into one house, jumped over the fence of the opposite house and into the following street and started running down the road and at all this time he was being shot at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> He was in the street that he jumped, again he went to the yard, then he went to another yard, then he jumped, he went to another street, then he went to another yard.  At that time when we chasing him, there was no gunfire.  Then from there there I was left behind and then Mamome was able to catch him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> He ran away and he decided that come what may, he was not going to runaway from the gunfire and that is how he got caught.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> It might be like that but maybe he just stood up and they arrested him I didn't see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, isn't it correct that you and Motsamai have had no differences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Not at all, we are friendly to each other, even up to now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> As the Chair pleases, those are my questions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR STANDER:</span> Mr Chair, I have been instructed to clear out one aspect with the witness.  After I'd ended my cross examination, do I have your permission, in the light thereof to ask one or two questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a>    Yes, Mr Morakile, I've been instructed that the incident in which Mr Oupa Makubalo was arrested in terms of which you just testified to us, took place before 6 April 1986.  What do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Before the sixth of April?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I believe there after that because I told you that on the 6th of April 1985 or 1986 I was not here, I came to Bloemfontein on the 21st of June 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Is it not possible, or rather let me state it this way:  What is your reaction that it indeed took place before the arrest of the group of 19.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> ...[no English translation]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He says he wasn't here and knows nothing about the arrest of the group of 19.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Mr Chair, I understand what he is saying but I got the impression that the witness is not very clear and very certain.  He indeed says that he only came there in June but I'm not quite certain whether it was an interpreting error.  I got the impression that he was ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I got the impression he's completely certain and he asked us to get hold of his South African Police records which should show precisely when he came there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Yes possible that would be indicated. In the light of another aspect, may I with your permission, ask another question?  I will deal with it in one or two questions I promise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Sorry, before you do that Mr Stander, is your client here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Are you referring to Mr Makubalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Yes. Is he able to remember the date on which this instant happened, one would think that he would remember that date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Unfortunately Mr Commissioner, I've been asking him the exact date, but he cannot remember it, but he although he says to me that he can still remember the incident were he was arrested happened before the incident were 19 people were arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a>    That he told me specifically  but unfortunately he cannot remember the exact date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> My learned friend has just put as a fact to this witness that it was before April 1986, surely that must come from somewhere. Could my learned friend tell me where he gets this information from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I told the Committee already, Mr Chairman that the information came from Mr Makubalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a>    He says to us, he said to me - he instructed me that this incident where he was arrested happened before the incident where the 19 people whereof he was a part, were arrested. That's my instructions, I've already told the Committee that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a>    Mr Morakile, please tell me, Mr Motsamai went to arrest a person who had killed somebody else, this informant of his, am I correct in that respect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> In other word he went to arrest a suspect on a murder charge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Then he came on the scene, there was a group of you who saw this, there was the person who was the suspect and he was running away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Yes, he was running and we chased after him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> You know what I can't understand about your denial and the denial of everybody else because if shots had been fired, it was totally legal in terms of our law.  I don't understand why you don't want to admit to this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> They're admitting that shots were fired, they say the shots were fired by Motsamai.  And I don't think anybody put it to them whether you considered those shots to be justified in the circumstances that prevailed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Thank you Mr Commissioner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a>	 I would like to state to you Mr Morakile, that if somebody else had fired shots in the direction of Oupa Makubalo, there was absolutely nothing wrong with it.  And I find it strange that every single person who'd been involved there deny this absolutely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> Motsamai shot, you must understand, he was hurt because his informer was killed and he was desperate to arrest this person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I have no further questions for the witness, thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STANDER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> One question, perhaps in re-examination.  Did you personally know Mr Oupa Makubalo on the day when you were requested to go and assist Mr Motsamai to arrest him, did you know who it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORAKILE:</span> I knew him afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, we will attempt to obtain the SAP record for you which will hopefully show when he was transferred from wherever to the security branch in Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> His pocket book should also show what he was doing on the day in question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, we will try to find those but they're notoriously difficult to trace but we'll try to find those as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a>    Mr Chairman, if you're waiting for me I must inform you at this stage, I've run dry of witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How on earth?  We've had nine months or something to get this thing going.  Surely the police can arrange to have people here. We're told that we're not going to finish and you assured me before the adjournment that we wouldn't finish this week.  At this rate we certainty won't if at quarter past three you have run out of witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, may I just place on record: this is the very first time that I have forced any sort of delay before this Committee.  My witnesses were here, I could never have anticipated that we'd go this quickly, that matters which form the basis of an application would not be put to the witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a>    Unfortunately my witnesses have now not - I don't have a witness here that I can call at the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you say they were here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well some, there were witnesses here all day long, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What's happened to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well they obviously have left, Mr Chairman, thinking that we won't come to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What right do they have to leave? If you have summonsed them here as witnesses. Did they speak to you or your attorney?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, if you could just allow me a very short adjournment, I will establish what the situation is and I will inform you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and I will want a full explanation from them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr Visser, are you also going to look into the possibility whether one or two of them can avail themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> One or two of them can?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Avail themselves for this afternoon. Are you also going to look into whether or not we can have one or two of them this afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's what I want to look into Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The moment they come - I've consulted with all of them, it's just a question - as I placed on record before, that they do have things to go on with Mr Chairman, and we kept three witnesses, in fact we've had five witnesses today.  I didn't anticipate that we'd finish with them as early as this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, we'll grant you a short adjournment.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now, you were informed that you were implicated in various incidents by the applicants in this case, is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What section did you work in the security branch in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Black section, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who was your commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> The first one was Major Coetzee and the second one was Captain Shaw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Which other members were there in the black section of the security branch here in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> It was myself, Mr Motsamai, Mr Sesedyane ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is spelt S-e-s-e-d-y-a-n-e.  Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Mr Mtyhala, Mr Miningwa - sorry, no, no, I beg your pardon, Mr Morakile and Mr Erasmus, Mr Killian, Mr Wydaman, he was my partner and others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright. How many members, can you remember, were there attached to the security branch in 1985/1986 here in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Mr Chairman, I will not be able to answer that question. But I would say we were more that 50 to 60, I'm just guessing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you know Mr Ngo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Yes, I knew this informer called Mr Ngo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now, in your affidavit, you said in paragraph 3, in the one at page 22, you said in paragraph 3 II, that you've known Mr Ngo since 1989. Is that date correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I would say that date is wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When did you first get to know  anything about Mr Ngo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> The time when I found him lying on the stomach on the stretcher being stabbed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> After he was stabbed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When was that?  Can you remember the year of that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I would say it's somewhere in 1986, but I'm not sure of that date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now what transpired later in regard to Mr Ngo that you know about, did you see him again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Yes, I saw him in our offices after that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was he doing there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I am not able to answer that because he was working with Mr Erasmus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1545"><a name="pos1545"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It is correct of course, that Mr Ngo became a student constable in March 1986 and that he left for Pretoria for the Police College, Training College in July 1986.  Are you prepared to accept that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Sir, I was not monitoring him at the time when he was there. I not able to say it was like that or not but what I know that he went to Ladybrand, then from there he left to Hammanskraal, but I not able to tell which year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you work with Mr Ngo at all when he was a student constable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> No Sir, I was not able to work with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you work with Mr Motsamai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> There were joint operations were both of us were engaged, that is when I met him but we were working in two's, that is one black, one white.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a>    To answer the question, yes, sometimes we were working together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Right, now we'll come to the incidents. Can I ask you this: in so far as either Motsamai or Mr Ngo alleged that you committed illegal or unlawful acts, what do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I am a policeman, there was nothing illegal which I've committed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright, Mr Ngo says, page 23 of his application, that you participated in the kidnapping and the assault of Mr White Mohape. Is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> He is lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that you participated in the murder of a UDF member called either JJ or Pape, at page 25 of his application. Is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> He is lying, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that you thereafter, when you were called upon to go to Batu Police Station, that you failed to admit that you knew something about the whereabouts of this person called JJ.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He says furthermore at page 27 of his application that you took part in the assault and torturing of comrades in 1986 in Bloemfontein. Is there any truth in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> There is no truth in that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Furthermore alleges that you similarly took, at page 31, that you similarly took part in the torturing of comrades in Botshabelo in 1986, what do you say tO that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I didn't go to Botshabelo, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He also told the Committee at page 41 that you participated in an attack on the clinic of Mrs Winnie Mandela and BrandforT, is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Motsamai, ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Before proceeding to that Mr Visser I've got problems with the answer.  He alleges that you failed to admit about JJ. and he said that's correct. What exactly ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Perhaps I should make it clearer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a>	Mr Ngo alleged that at on a certain day, a group of people including yourself and Motsamai, had to go to Batu Police Station to speak to a warrant officer Modise.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that it was Warrant Officer Tsoametsi that told you to go there and when you arrived there you were asked about - this is page 26 Mr Chairman, you were asked whether you could give information about the body of the person that was found wearing a UDF T-shirt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1572"><a name="pos1572"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> We found that UDF dressed in - we found that corpse dressed in UDF T-shirt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1573"><a name="pos1573"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now I'm talking about a visit to Batu Police Station.  Did you go to Batu Police Station together with Mr Motsamai and Warrant Officer Tsoametsi to speak to Warrant Officer Modise, M-o-d-i-s-e, and did you there tell him that you knew nothing about the identity of this person or what had happened to him? - that is the person, the corpse in the UDF T-shirt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1574"><a name="pos1574"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> What is the question, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1575"><a name="pos1575"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The question is whether you told Mr Modise at Batu ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1576"><a name="pos1576"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well isn't the question first - you put a very long question there, isn't the question first: did you go with Warrant Officer Tsaometsi and Constable Mtyhala to Batu Police Station to see Warrant officer Modise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1577"><a name="pos1577"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I went there but I don't remember with whom did I go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where you asked whether you could give information about the corpse that was found wearing a UDF T-shirt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you then tell Warrant Officer Modise that you couldn't give any information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1582"><a name="pos1582"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I think that is what the witness was talking about Commissioner de Jager.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a>    Mr Ngo also implicated you in the murder, robbery, murder and robbery of Mr Venter. Do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct. I read about it on the paper of Ngo's amnesty application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And he says that you were one of the persons who took him to Mr Venter's house for him to murder Mr Venter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I do not know Mr Venter. I Haven't seen him, I haven't met Mr Venter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you take Mr Ngo to a house so that he could murder somebody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Bear with me a moment Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a>	In any event, Mr Ngo also said that you gave instructions for them to go back - well, to bury the body of Mr Venter, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> It's not so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And afterwards to back to ransack or to take items out of the house of Mr Venter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That you in fact, took his car, you and Mr Ngo, took his car and you went to Botshabelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1595"><a name="pos1595"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I did not go there, I did not go with Mr Ngo, that is his story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1596"><a name="pos1596"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you make any prior arrangements for Mr Venter's car to be stored amongst stolen vehicles? At the Police Station at Botshabelo with Mr Mbanjani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Ngo alleged that you took jewelry, that was taken from Mr Venter's house for yourself And aou paid certain people money for their assistance in the robbery of Mr Venter.  Is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> It's not like that Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In short, you had nothing to do with the murder or robbery of Mr Venter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I don't even know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Right.  Mr Motsamai at page 146 of bundle B, says that you participated in the killing of a person by the name of George Musi in Melk Street, Bothchabela.  Is there any truth in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I don't know this man called George Musi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you take part in killing a person in Melk Street with Mr Motsamai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1605"><a name="pos1605"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1606"><a name="pos1606"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He suggested in his paragraph two that you were also involved in burning the house of Mrs Winnie Mandela in Brandfort, it was during the 1980s he says, and you accompanied him.  Is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> It's not like that, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And he goes on to say that a few weeks later, the two of you burnt her clinic as well, Paragraph two page one four six of bundle B.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's one 146, paragraph one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a>    I'm sorry, I don't know whether you answered.  He says that a few weeks later, after burning the house of Mrs Winnie Mandela, you and him burnt the clinic that was next to her house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1614"><a name="pos1614"></a>    Is there any truth in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> He's lying, this boy is lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1616"><a name="pos1616"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In paragraph three at page 146, he says that himself and you petrol-bombed a house of an MK member, Bobby Sebotsa, where he was staying, it was his parent's home.  And that house is situated in Mpinda street, Botchabela, is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1617"><a name="pos1617"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> This boy is lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In paragraph four he says that yourself, him, Constable Mtyhala, Constable Morakile petrol- bombed a house belonging to a businessman, Nicos.  Is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1619"><a name="pos1619"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That's a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you know Mr Nicos?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I know him. I beg your pardon, I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1622"><a name="pos1622"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you tell the Committee anything about your relationship with Mr Nicos?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1623"><a name="pos1623"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I would say he was my friend.  We visited him, we used to go out with him.  I began to associate myself with him through a certain person I was working with.  The name of my friend is Kabuza that is K-h-a- u-z-a, Kabuza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1624"><a name="pos1624"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now this Kabuza, we have heard evidence that he lived on the on the same property, he lived on Mr Nicos' property, is that correct, in a room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1625"><a name="pos1625"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Yes, he was renting at Nicos' place but these outside rooms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1626"><a name="pos1626"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now as far as the attack on Mr Nicos' house was concerned, there was an unfortunate incident that took place. Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1627"><a name="pos1627"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> You mean at Nicos' place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1628"><a name="pos1628"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1629"><a name="pos1629"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1630"><a name="pos1630"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Please tell the Committee about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1631"><a name="pos1631"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> This constable Kabuza committed suicide by shooting himself, he was himself at Kabuza's place, Nicos' place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1632"><a name="pos1632"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> There was an incident concerning a little girl, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1633"><a name="pos1633"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> It did not happen at Nicos' place, it happened at Rocklands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1634"><a name="pos1634"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright, well just tell the Committee what happened there as far as you could ascertain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1635"><a name="pos1635"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Without mentioning the people's names, it happened that Captain Kholae informed us that a certain girl disappeared in Rocklands.  He was requesting that I should assist him in trying to find this girl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1636"><a name="pos1636"></a>    I went with Captain Kholae to a particular house at the corner. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1637"><a name="pos1637"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you just spell that surname Khoale? MR MAMOME:   K-h-o-a-l-e.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1638"><a name="pos1638"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  And you went you went somewhere, yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1639"><a name="pos1639"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> We went to Rocklands, the street is Mabule, M-a-b-u-l-e Street.  It was the corner house and next door to that house there was a garage owned by Nicos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1640"><a name="pos1640"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and what did you find at the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1641"><a name="pos1641"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> We found a boy, we asked that boy about the where abouts of this girl because they last say them together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1642"><a name="pos1642"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, Mr Mamame, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  I think you don't have to tell us what everybody told you. If you could just perhaps tell us what what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1643"><a name="pos1643"></a>    Did you find this little girl?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1644"><a name="pos1644"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Yes, the girl was in the wardrobe, she was strangled.  She was 'round six years old, her corpse was decomposed.  The incident is that we learnt about, we learnt that she - so what happened thereafter all the business people, that is the people owning businesses in ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1645"><a name="pos1645"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I heard the witness say: "we learnt that" but I didn't hear what they learnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1646"><a name="pos1646"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I said we found a body in the wardrobe, this was a six year old girl, this body was already mutilated in that house.  Now these people ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1647"><a name="pos1647"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, was the body decomposed or mutilated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1648"><a name="pos1648"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Decomposed, Mr Chairman.  We don't know where the story came about that it was for muti purposes.  Now, the house was searched so that we could find if whether there were many children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1649"><a name="pos1649"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now after having found the remains of this unfortunate child, what happened as far as Mr Nicos' was concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1650"><a name="pos1650"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Chairperson, I would be committing myself.  His house was petrol bomb attacked but I would not say it was attacked by the community because of this discovered body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1651"><a name="pos1651"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now Mr Motsamai also said that Mr Nicos was a courier for the ANC in Lesotho.  Did you know anything about that, whether it was true or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1652"><a name="pos1652"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I would not know that, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1653"><a name="pos1653"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In paragraph 5 at page 146 of bundle B, Mr Motsamai says that you and himself burned a motor vehicle belonging to Jannie Mohape.  Is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1654"><a name="pos1654"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1655"><a name="pos1655"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And in paragraph 6 at page 147, he applied for ...[End of tape 4B - no follow-on sound]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1656"><a name="pos1656"></a>Lesale - L-e-s-a-l-e and Constable Miningwa - M-i-n-i-n-g-w-a petrol-bombed the parental home of Citi Mzuzwana.  Now, did you know whether that - whether the house of the parents of Citi Mzuzwana, was in fact burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1657"><a name="pos1657"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I don't know that, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1658"><a name="pos1658"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you take part in any such illegal act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1659"><a name="pos1659"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1660"><a name="pos1660"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Paragraph 7 at page 147, Mr Motsamai says that himself and you organised that members of the uniform branch should shoot Citi Mzuzwana's younger brother, Zwelinzima Mzuzwana.  Is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1661"><a name="pos1661"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is a lie Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1662"><a name="pos1662"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you remember about this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1663"><a name="pos1663"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I know that that person was shot but to ...[indistinct] certain police that that person should be shot, it would not happen. I did not do that. No policeman can be told by another policeman to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1664"><a name="pos1664"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And there was a court case in which Mr Citi Mzuzwana, sorry Zwelinzima Mzuzwana, claimed damages. Do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1665"><a name="pos1665"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Isn't it supposed to be ZweliNjaNi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1666"><a name="pos1666"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It's Matthews, I think if I should, if I may be allowed to refer to Matthews?  Do you know of a court case which Mathew made to claim damages?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1667"><a name="pos1667"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I would answer your question Matthews had a file at security branch.  I read at SAP5 that he sued the state for R90 000.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1668"><a name="pos1668"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright. If we can go over to the next paragraph, paragraph 8 at page 147.  Here Mr Motsamai says that he, together with yourself and Mr Ngo, were involved in the petrol bombing Citi Mzuzwana's house. He says and that house is situated in the former Xhosa section of Rocklands in Bloemfontein.  Is there any truth in that allegation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1669"><a name="pos1669"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1670"><a name="pos1670"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In paragraph 9 at page 147 he says that himself, that is Motsamai and you, burnt and petrol- bombed a motor vehicle belonging to one Thabang, T-h-a-b-a-n-g, who was a teacher at Vulamasango High School in Bloemfontein and who was an orgainser of the United Democratic Front.  Is it true that you participated in petrol-bombing a vehicle belonging to that person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1671"><a name="pos1671"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I think he's talking about Mr Thabatha, no Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1672"><a name="pos1672"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thabatha, T-h-a-b-a-t-h-a?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1673"><a name="pos1673"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1674"><a name="pos1674"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In paragraph 10 at page 147, Mr Motsamai alleges that himself, you, Constable Morakile, Constable Mtyhala, Constable Litseho and Constable Lesale, L-e-s-a-l-e, petrol bombed the house of a teacher, Balosha who was a member of the UDF.  Is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1675"><a name="pos1675"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> He's lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1676"><a name="pos1676"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now in paragraph 11 at page 147, he did not specifically implicate you, but - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm thinking of 13, terribly sorry, Mr chairman.  In paragraph 11 Mr Motsamai says that you and he petrol-bombed houses of other political activists and he says, and he mentions the houses belonging to Khuze- K-h-u-z-e and Sekgopi- S-e-k-g-o-p-i Malebo, it looks like - M-a-l-e-b-o.  Do you know anything or did you take part in petrol bombing any houses including that of Mr Khuze or Malebo?  Sorry just repeat your answer please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1677"><a name="pos1677"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> It's not like that, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1678"><a name="pos1678"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> At page 148 paragraph 12, Mr Motsamai alleges that himself, you, Sergeant Sesedinyane and Constable Morakile, petrol-bombed a parish house in Botshabelo.  Is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1679"><a name="pos1679"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is not correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1680"><a name="pos1680"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In fact, in his evidence he said that you wrote a letter to the priest, is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1681"><a name="pos1681"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I hear that for the first time today, maybe he is trying to colour his amnesty statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1682"><a name="pos1682"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now, in paragraph 13, he does not mention you by name, but he refers there to assault and torture of detained and/or arrested political activists at the offices of the internal security unit on the 5th floor in Fountain Street, Bloemfontein.  If this refers to the group of 19 people who were arrested in the Ladybrand district and brought to Bloemfontein, my question to you is did you take part in any assault on them or any torturing of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1683"><a name="pos1683"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1684"><a name="pos1684"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you assault or torture any detainee in the building at Fountain Street Mr Mamone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1685"><a name="pos1685"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1686"><a name="pos1686"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Lastly, paragraph 14 at page 148, deals with the arrest of Oupa Makubalo. Can you tell the Committee what you know about that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1687"><a name="pos1687"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> We were in the kitchen, Mr Motsamai came running and he said one of his informer called him,  he identified where Oupa Makubalo hid.  So he requested our help to go and fetch Makubalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1688"><a name="pos1688"></a>    He wanted Makubalo because Makubalo killed another informer of his. I was driving that Kombi, we drove to Botchabela ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1689"><a name="pos1689"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just a moment, would you just tell the Committee who were in the Kombi.  Was Mr Motsamai in the Kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1690"><a name="pos1690"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> He was present, he was sitting at the door at the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1691"><a name="pos1691"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright, and you were driving?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1692"><a name="pos1692"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1693"><a name="pos1693"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who else was in the Kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1694"><a name="pos1694"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Mr Ramosoeu, Mr Morakile - Chairperson, and others, because we came out of the building running, it's impossible to try and identify others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1695"><a name="pos1695"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You say you don't remember the others. Alright.  You drove the Kombi and where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1696"><a name="pos1696"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> We drove to a location called Botchabela. MR VISSER:   And, just continue.  Did you drive down a certain street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1697"><a name="pos1697"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Yes, but I forgot the name of the street but anyway we arrive at that house.  Mr Makubalo was standing outside and I opened the window, I called him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1698"><a name="pos1698"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was he standing alone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1699"><a name="pos1699"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> He was with other two boys. I called him to come nearer, he was on his way coming. Mr Motsamai opened the door, he went behind the Kombi and he fired a shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1700"><a name="pos1700"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what happened thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1701"><a name="pos1701"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Oupa ran, he ran and we chased him and he asked us why were we shooting at him.  I then caught him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1702"><a name="pos1702"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you see or hear or how many times did Mr Motsamai shoot at Oupa Makubalo according to your recollection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1703"><a name="pos1703"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I could not count.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1704"><a name="pos1704"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was it more than once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1705"><a name="pos1705"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Yes, he was actually pumping, he was not playing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1706"><a name="pos1706"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And is it correct that you in fact got hold of Mr Makubalo and you restrained him and arrested him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1707"><a name="pos1707"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1708"><a name="pos1708"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you assault Mr Makubalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1709"><a name="pos1709"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Chairperson, I caught him, I did not assault him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1710"><a name="pos1710"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where did you then take him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1711"><a name="pos1711"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> We took him to the police station to the person who was working on Mr Venter's - on Mr Kosi's murder.  I do not remember well, I don't want to lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1712"><a name="pos1712"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you have anything further to do with Mr Oupa Makubalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1713"><a name="pos1713"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Not at all, Sir, I did not have anything to do with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1714"><a name="pos1714"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was he charged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1715"><a name="pos1715"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Chairperson, I would not know because we handed him over to the investigating officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1716"><a name="pos1716"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1717"><a name="pos1717"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I think it's at Fuchsware, if not at the office, I do not remember well Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1718"><a name="pos1718"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, what's the first place you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1719"><a name="pos1719"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Fuchsware.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1720"><a name="pos1720"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Fuchsware, it's electrical appliance, Fuchsware Building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1721"><a name="pos1721"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it should be possible to obtain a date, a fixed date for when this arrest took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1722"><a name="pos1722"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We will make esquires Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1723"><a name="pos1723"></a>    Mr Mamome, is the security branch still accommodated in the Fontain Street building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1724"><a name="pos1724"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1725"><a name="pos1725"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I thought that the security branch moved out of the Fontain Street Building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1726"><a name="pos1726"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> We are many now, we have the district - we are in Fountain Street and Aliwal Street now, we have two offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1727"><a name="pos1727"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, that's the evidence in chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1728"><a name="pos1728"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1729"><a name="pos1729"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, I have no questions for the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1730"><a name="pos1730"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR DU PLESSIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1731"><a name="pos1731"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR STANDER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1732"><a name="pos1732"></a>	Mr Mamome, did you participate in the interrogation of the group of 19 persons at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1733"><a name="pos1733"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1734"><a name="pos1734"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> What was your task with regard to the interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1735"><a name="pos1735"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I was filling the forms called the historical report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1736"><a name="pos1736"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Which section did you work in at that stage at the security police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1737"><a name="pos1737"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Black section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1738"><a name="pos1738"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> In other words it was also your task to investigate the youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1739"><a name="pos1739"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1740"><a name="pos1740"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> So the reply or the answers that you received there directly applicable to your field of work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1741"><a name="pos1741"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1742"><a name="pos1742"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Do you think that it was imperative for you at that stage to get answers to a lot of questions that you asked them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1743"><a name="pos1743"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Repeat your question Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1744"><a name="pos1744"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Do you think it was very important for you to get answers to a lot of questions that you needed in your work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1745"><a name="pos1745"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1746"><a name="pos1746"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> From what I could understand about the group, they were not prepared to give their co-operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1747"><a name="pos1747"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is not so, they were co-operative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1748"><a name="pos1748"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> How did you succeed in getting their co-operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1749"><a name="pos1749"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> It depended on the type of questions and how you asked them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1750"><a name="pos1750"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> If I understand you correctly, you said they gave you their co-operation.  Did they reply properly to all the questions you put to them?  Were you satisfied?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1751"><a name="pos1751"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Sir, I am answering you.  Chairperson, ...[inaudible].  They gave their names and their addresses and what type of work they do. Such questions they answered, there's nothing difficult in answering those questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1752"><a name="pos1752"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> But what was asked to them ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1753"><a name="pos1753"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1754"><a name="pos1754"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did they say nothing further, that what they were going to look for overseas or abroad, who their leaders were, and what else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1755"><a name="pos1755"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> You're right, that kind of question appeared, where the person was going to, what was he going to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1756"><a name="pos1756"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> But did they give their co-operation in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1757"><a name="pos1757"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1758"><a name="pos1758"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> So if they didn't come to tell or if you say they weren't prepared to give their co-operation then the others are all lying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1759"><a name="pos1759"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Sir, I am giving you an answer.  There were 19 people who were arrested, Chairperson, and Mr Stander, I believe you're not representing 19 of them all.   Now those you are representing are not the only ones we interrogated.  Now those you are not representing were also interrogated.  I am sorry to tell you that I was interrogating the ones you are not representing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1760"><a name="pos1760"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Will you just reply to my question, namely, that whether they gave their co-operation and replies to all the questions you put to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1761"><a name="pos1761"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1762"><a name="pos1762"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> So did not not reply as you would have liked to any of the questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1763"><a name="pos1763"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> They answered what I asked them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1764"><a name="pos1764"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Who did they say they were going to meet outside the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1765"><a name="pos1765"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Chairperson, they did not mention who they were going to - they said they wanted to go to Lesotho to attend school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1766"><a name="pos1766"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Did you not ask them who they were going to meet out side the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1767"><a name="pos1767"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Chair, no Chairperson, that was the duty of another section, it was not my duty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1768"><a name="pos1768"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I thought you said that was one of the questions on the questionnaire, on the form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1769"><a name="pos1769"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct and I hand the form over to the other section to look to that matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1770"><a name="pos1770"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> So you did not ask them that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1771"><a name="pos1771"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I would ask them what was on the form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1772"><a name="pos1772"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Well the question that I've asked you, according to your evidence, also appeared on the form, According to your earlier evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1773"><a name="pos1773"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1774"><a name="pos1774"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Well did you skip that question or did you ask them that question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1775"><a name="pos1775"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I do not remember well, I think I asked them that question because I was going paragraph by paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1776"><a name="pos1776"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Well that must have been a very important question ANd the answer then if would probably be even more important, of interest to you. Did you ask them that question or did you not ask them that question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1777"><a name="pos1777"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I asked them that question and if they did not give answers there was nothing more to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1778"><a name="pos1778"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Did they answer it or not, before we come to that, to what you do if they didn't answer it. Did they answer it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1779"><a name="pos1779"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Some of them, Chairperson, answered the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1780"><a name="pos1780"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And some of them didn't?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1781"><a name="pos1781"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1782"><a name="pos1782"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> What do you mean by saying some of them didn't answer the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1783"><a name="pos1783"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I mean when you asked him: "man what were you going to do", the answer would be: "no I'm not in a position to answer that question".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1784"><a name="pos1784"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And would you leave it there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1785"><a name="pos1785"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1786"><a name="pos1786"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr Stander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1787"><a name="pos1787"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Sorry you said if they - you've asked certain questions then you handed the form to another section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1788"><a name="pos1788"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Yes, It was called the investigation unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1789"><a name="pos1789"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Right, to whom did you hand that form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1790"><a name="pos1790"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Chairperson, I do not remember specifically to who did I give this form because it was confusion on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1791"><a name="pos1791"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Who was the head of the investigative unit to whom this form should be handed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1792"><a name="pos1792"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Captain Du Plooy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1793"><a name="pos1793"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Mr Mamome, I understood you to say that these people gave their co-operation when you asked them the questions But when Judge Ngoepe asked you what happened when the people did not want to reply, then you just kept quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1794"><a name="pos1794"></a>    Then surely it is not due to the fact that they always gave their co-operation, or did I understand you incorrectly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1795"><a name="pos1795"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I might have made a mistake, that's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1796"><a name="pos1796"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> But why did you make such a mistake?  Was there a specific reason for you making such a mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1797"><a name="pos1797"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1798"><a name="pos1798"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Will you explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1799"><a name="pos1799"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Ask your question Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1800"><a name="pos1800"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> You told us that you made a mistake. I would like to know from you whether there was a reason why you made such a mistake?  Perhaps you did not hear what was said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1801"><a name="pos1801"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Mr Stander, you ask your questions differently from Judge Ngoepe, you are very fast in asking your questions.  You've got your way of asking questions, his got his own way of asking questions and his is polite.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1802"><a name="pos1802"></a>	Now if a person speaks to me and the person shouts, you make me nervous.  Now when you speak to me please cool down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1803"><a name="pos1803"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I am sorry, I think the Chairman would have interrupted me a long time ago, as well as your legal representatives if they had thought that I was cross-examining you unfairly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1804"><a name="pos1804"></a>    Would you like to tell us now that the reason why you made a mistake was because that I cross-examined you in an improper manner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1805"><a name="pos1805"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I did not understand your question as it was put by Judge Ngoepe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1806"><a name="pos1806"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I'm going to repeat.  On a question from Judge Ngoepe - or let me rather start.  I asked you when you asked or questioned this group of 19 you told us that you had their co-operation throughout and that they gave the answers which satisfied you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1807"><a name="pos1807"></a>    When Judge Ngoepe asked you, specifically as a result of this, you answered that on some of the questions, among others what they were going to do overseas, that replied that they were not going to even answer to that question.  Then I asked you, I said that they didn't give their co-operation in that case and you told us that you made a mistake.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1808"><a name="pos1808"></a>	The question now is, did you not understand the questions or what is the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1809"><a name="pos1809"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct, I did not understand your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1810"><a name="pos1810"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you not understand my question or that of judge Mwepi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1811"><a name="pos1811"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Your question, Mr Stander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1812"><a name="pos1812"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I'm going to put it to you again. If you told me that the people gave their co-operation throughout and gave their replies to all your questions, or did you not say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1813"><a name="pos1813"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1814"><a name="pos1814"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Why did you then when Judge Ngoepe asked you, specifically with regard to the visit overseas, said that the - you said that the people told you that they were not going to reply to that question?  Or did you misunderstand Judge Ngoepe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1815"><a name="pos1815"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> You took 10 I think, I do not know where to answer.  Let me take it one one, Sir, I will split it.  I am listening as you are talking, it is difficult, start again step by step.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1816"><a name="pos1816"></a>    The people that I interrogated it was not as such interrogation, it was a form, a district form, a history form.  Some of them were co-operative, they answered all questions, some of them were not answering questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1817"><a name="pos1817"></a>    Some of the questions would be answered, some of the questions would not be answered, that's all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1818"><a name="pos1818"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I'm asking you again, why did you then tell me that you received replies to all the questions you put to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1819"><a name="pos1819"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> When you interrogate people or ask questions, you don't only fill in that form, there are many other issues that you ask people questions about. Now to answer your question: Some of the questions were answered, some of the questions were not answered.  Now when I replied to your question I was generalising.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1820"><a name="pos1820"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> So you were generalising?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1821"><a name="pos1821"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I answered your question in that way when you asked me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1822"><a name="pos1822"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> So you did not misunderstand my question, you were just generalising.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1823"><a name="pos1823"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] get on with this, you've made a point haven't you, Mr Stander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1824"><a name="pos1824"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I'm sorry Mr Chairman, I will try to speed things up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1825"><a name="pos1825"></a>    Let's go on to the question that you asked them as to what they were going to do in Maseru.  You say that there were some of them that weren't prepared to answer that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1826"><a name="pos1826"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1827"><a name="pos1827"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> But was it not important for you to know the answer to that question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1828"><a name="pos1828"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Every question on that form is very important.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1829"><a name="pos1829"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> When they did not reply to such an important question as in your own testimony, what did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1830"><a name="pos1830"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> He was going to the cells.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1831"><a name="pos1831"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> So when they did not want to answer your questions, you had them locked up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1832"><a name="pos1832"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> When they are in the cells they are no longer in my hands they are under the people responsible for investigation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1833"><a name="pos1833"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> The question I put you, in all fairness, is that they did not want to reply to the questions as to what they were going to do in Maseru, did you do nothing about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1834"><a name="pos1834"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1835"><a name="pos1835"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> You did not even try to put the question differently, in your own version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1836"><a name="pos1836"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Nothing Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1837"><a name="pos1837"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Let me put it to you that I find it highly improbable and extremely strange.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1838"><a name="pos1838"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Carry on Sir, I'm listening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1839"><a name="pos1839"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> You must reply to that, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1840"><a name="pos1840"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> It's not a question, you are making a statement, Mr Stander, you say I find it extremely strange.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1841"><a name="pos1841"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I just gave him a fair chance to reply because if I had not done that then surely I cannot argue about that at the end of the day.  I will, however leave it there, I think I've made my point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1842"><a name="pos1842"></a>    Tell me, did you work on the 5th floor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1843"><a name="pos1843"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1844"><a name="pos1844"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Also in the so called Violent Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1845"><a name="pos1845"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That's a sticker, There's never been a place such as that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1846"><a name="pos1846"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> So was the passage, according to you, not even called Violent Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1847"><a name="pos1847"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1848"><a name="pos1848"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> What about the other police officers that said: "Yes it was sometime called Violent Street" do you think that they are telling lies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1849"><a name="pos1849"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> It's because there was a sticker written Violent Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1850"><a name="pos1850"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you as police officers never refer to this specific passage as Violent Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1851"><a name="pos1851"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I did not know it as Violent Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1852"><a name="pos1852"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> How long did you say have you been working at security branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1853"><a name="pos1853"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I arrived there in 1980, it was about six years that I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1854"><a name="pos1854"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> And you said you never knew that this passage was the so-called Violent Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1855"><a name="pos1855"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> You're telling me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1856"><a name="pos1856"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Are you saying that this is the first time that you've heard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1857"><a name="pos1857"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1858"><a name="pos1858"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Well, I find that very strange but let's leave it at that.  I want to put it to you that you did not merely ask the calm questions that you said you did, you played an active role in the interrogation of these persons and the assault of  these people?   What do you have to say in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1859"><a name="pos1859"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I don't enjoy beating up a detained person and I don't beat people and I did not beat up anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1860"><a name="pos1860"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> So all the witnesses who testified here as to their assaults, they must all have been telling a total lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1861"><a name="pos1861"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> They know themselves they were not assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1862"><a name="pos1862"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Do you agree that they had no reason to come and lie to this Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1863"><a name="pos1863"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> They don't have any reason to lie before this Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1864"><a name="pos1864"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> That it why it is even more improbable   ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1865"><a name="pos1865"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible) a reason to lie to the Committee Or did you say they had no reason to lie to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1866"><a name="pos1866"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> They don't have a reason, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1867"><a name="pos1867"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1868"><a name="pos1868"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> He says they don't have a reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1869"><a name="pos1869"></a>	On this particular day, Did you see anybody else who was assaulting these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1870"><a name="pos1870"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> i did not see anyone Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1871"><a name="pos1871"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you see Mr Motsamai where he was assaulting people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1872"><a name="pos1872"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I was not working with this boy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1873"><a name="pos1873"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> But he says that he assaulted them, some of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1874"><a name="pos1874"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Mr Stander, we work in different offices. What happens in another man's office is unknown to you.  Whether he assaulted him, it might have taken place in his office, I was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1875"><a name="pos1875"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you, at any stage, late that afternoon, see the group together again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1876"><a name="pos1876"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Which group, Mr Stander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1877"><a name="pos1877"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> With the group of 19 people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1878"><a name="pos1878"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I do not remember, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1879"><a name="pos1879"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Were you present or involved in the transferring of the group of 19 to other police stations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1880"><a name="pos1880"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Yes, I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1881"><a name="pos1881"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Where there any of these who appeared to have been injured or assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1882"><a name="pos1882"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I took a group that was taken to Bloemspruit, among them no one showing any sign of assault.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1883"><a name="pos1883"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Was Oupa Makubalo part of the group that you took to Bloemspruit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1884"><a name="pos1884"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I do not remember, Mr Stander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1885"><a name="pos1885"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Was there not one member in your group who was taken to Bloemspruit who seemed to have been assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1886"><a name="pos1886"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> No, no one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1887"><a name="pos1887"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> How did you decide which people were to go to which police station or did you decide this beforehand?  I just want your assistance here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1888"><a name="pos1888"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I was not part of the decision makers as to who should go where.  We were only - I only - don't ask me who told us because I cannot remember but I know that this group was supposed to be taken to Bloemspruit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1889"><a name="pos1889"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> At that stage, was the group together in totality when you decided who was going where and who would take whom or how did it work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1890"><a name="pos1890"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> They were already grouped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1891"><a name="pos1891"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> And you say the group that you took, that not one of them were assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1892"><a name="pos1892"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1893"><a name="pos1893"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Tell me, what do you say about the fact that Mr Motsamai said that he assaulted some of the people in the group of 19?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1894"><a name="pos1894"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I really do not know, maybe he assaulted them in my absence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1895"><a name="pos1895"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> If he were to have assaulted these people do you think they would have made loud noises due to the assaults that were made on them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1896"><a name="pos1896"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Mr Stander, I believe so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1897"><a name="pos1897"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you hear any such sounds on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1898"><a name="pos1898"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> In our office?  Nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1899"><a name="pos1899"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Do you want to tell us that those assaults, even those to have been committed by Motsamai that they did not take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1900"><a name="pos1900"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Mr Stander, I do not know what was done by Mr Motsamai, I do not know it at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1901"><a name="pos1901"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> But I'm asking you, if a person is assaulted then surely he is going to scream and make a noise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1902"><a name="pos1902"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Mr Stander, If a person screams, I would hear, if a person does not scream, how would I hear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1903"><a name="pos1903"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Because witness after witness has testified that how they screamed but the simple question I am putting to you is, let us accept for the moment that it was only Motsamai that had assaulted them on that day, then surely, someone should have heard the screaming but according to you, you heard no screaming at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1904"><a name="pos1904"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1905"><a name="pos1905"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Stander, I think you could take this further in argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1906"><a name="pos1906"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> As it pleases you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1907"><a name="pos1907"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Stander, I think the time has come to remind you that you were told during the adjournment that in the procedure laid down, we have a right to limit cross examination.  And it appears to me that you have been repeating and repeating the same points witness after witness were it's now become a matter of argument, hasn't it?  Is there any point in this constant repetition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1908"><a name="pos1908"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I am of the opinion that the last question that I put - I do not want to cross swords with you, but these are the improbabilities that I have to prove before this Committee, that I can argue in this regard.  And if I do point them out to the witnesses then the argument that I want to hold at the end of the day will sound hollow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1909"><a name="pos1909"></a>    But I have followed your train of thought and I will try to shorten my questions with regard to the other aspects.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1910"><a name="pos1910"></a>     Let us go over to the matter of Mr Makubalo.  Can you tell us what was the reason that you took your firearm with you the day that you wanted to go and arrest Oupa Makubalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1911"><a name="pos1911"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Chairperson, I do not carry a gun, I do not go around with a gun.  As I am sitting here, I don't have a gun.  I have never carried a gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1912"><a name="pos1912"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> So that day you did not have a firearm with you either?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1913"><a name="pos1913"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I did not have a gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1914"><a name="pos1914"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Was it not dangerous to go into the black townships without a weapon, because I understand that there was unrest in the townships?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1915"><a name="pos1915"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> It is true, but Chairperson at that time there were many people in the Kombi and they all had firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1916"><a name="pos1916"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> So you placed your safety in the hands of those who were with you in the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1917"><a name="pos1917"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1918"><a name="pos1918"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Why did you jump out and start running because you did not have a firearm with you?  You just told us that you entrusted your safety to the people who were in the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1919"><a name="pos1919"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Chairperson, it was daylight, I could see Oupa Makubalo and he did not have any weapon with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1920"><a name="pos1920"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Were you not scared of him or for the group that he was with because you suspected him of murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1921"><a name="pos1921"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Oupa was not in a group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1922"><a name="pos1922"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> You fired the first shots that day, that's what we we were told. What do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1923"><a name="pos1923"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I did not have a gun Chairperson, it can't be me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1924"><a name="pos1924"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Tell me, when you caught up to Oupa Makubalo, did he walk back with you voluntarily?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1925"><a name="pos1925"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Oupa was walking.  He was not a kind of person who would resist the arrest, he would go by the rules.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1926"><a name="pos1926"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you see that one of his front teeth was missing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1927"><a name="pos1927"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I did not realise that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1928"><a name="pos1928"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you not see it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1929"><a name="pos1929"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1930"><a name="pos1930"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I want to put it to you that you were the person who either hit or kicked out his front tooth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1931"><a name="pos1931"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> ...[No English translation]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1932"><a name="pos1932"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Could it perhaps have been Motsamai that did it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1933"><a name="pos1933"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I do not know, I did not assault this person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1934"><a name="pos1934"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you see Motsamai when he was doing this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1935"><a name="pos1935"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> When he arrived, Oupa was already sitting in the Kombi, he did not do anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1936"><a name="pos1936"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Just before I leave this point, let me just go through my notes, with your permission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1937"><a name="pos1937"></a>    I also want to put it to you that not only did you assault this group of 19 but that you also shocked them with an electric apparatus in order to get answers from them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1938"><a name="pos1938"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> ...[no sound]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1939"><a name="pos1939"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Tell Mr Mathews Mzuzwana, were you present on the day that he was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1940"><a name="pos1940"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> I was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1941"><a name="pos1941"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Mr Chairman, I am grateful to my learned friend, I understand that Mr Mamome did not reply to the question as to whether electric appliances were used on the group of 19.  I understand that he did not reply.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1942"><a name="pos1942"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> Mr Stander, you are telling me that for the first time.  Even the victims themselves did not give evidence to the fact that I shocked them, it's just a story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1943"><a name="pos1943"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I have no further questions for this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1944"><a name="pos1944"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STANDER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1945"><a name="pos1945"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Memani, how long do you think you will be with this one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1946"><a name="pos1946"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Not very long, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1947"><a name="pos1947"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> More than five minutes?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1951"><a name="pos1951"></a>	 Mr Mamome, did I hear you correctly, and you must tell me if I'm wrong, did you say that after the Kombi stopped you called Oupa and he moved towards the direction of the Kombi and while he was moving in the direction of the Kombi, Mamome fired the shots and only after Mamome fired - I'm sorry, only after Mr Motsamai fired the shots, did Mr Makubalo start running away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1952"><a name="pos1952"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMOME:</span> That is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1953"><a name="pos1953"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Thank you.  But before Mr Motsamai fired the shots, Oupa was actually coming towards the Kombi as you had called him.</p>
