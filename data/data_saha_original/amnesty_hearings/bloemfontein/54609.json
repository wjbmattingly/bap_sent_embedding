I came back in the same year.  When I came back I stayed in Sebokeng.  I stayed in Sebokeng, East Rand and Vosloorus, and I went back to Tamahole.  Just some time in Tamahole a comrade of mine was killed and I went to Johannesburg.  In 1988 I skipped the country for Lusaka.  From Lusaka I went to Uganda for a course at Dr Nkabinde Training Centre and I was deployed to the camp as a tailor and in 1991 I left the camp, I went to town in Kampala where I went to study for a personnel management certificate, which lasted six months, and I asked amnesty to be allowed to come to the country.  In 1992, on the 22nd of April I was given amnesty and I was repatriated and I came back to the country.\n\tOn my arrival here, that is when I arrived at Jan Smuts Airport, I met one of the comrades I left behind in this country, and I asked him about Benjamin Cholota, that is Benjie. I asked him whether he was still around, and he told me yes, he was working around Johannesburg, and he gave me his telephone numbers and while at the airport I called him.

            "I called Benjamin Cholota at the attorneys' offices. He was not present and I left a message to let him know that I have arrived.  And I left for my home. I stayed a week and I received a call from Benjamin to come down to Johannesburg.  I went to Benjamin on a Wednesday and we sat and we talked. He told me about this self-defence unit that was formed around Tamahole.  And we discussed and we realised - as we were discussing, we said as the youth needed arms, so we had to go out and disarm the enemy, and we made an arrangement to meet on Friday.  On Thursday I went back to Tamahole.\n\tFriday came.  At about six o'clock in the afternoon, Benjamin Cholota arrived at home and I went to see him.  He was washing himself and he sent someone to buy a drink so that while he is busy washing himself, I should drink something. After that we went to Mr Skosana's house and we sat down.  We discussed with some of the comrades. It was a welcome party for myself, because I was from exile.  I didn't stay long with them to enjoy the party, because we had a mission to disarm the enemy.  They stopped me.  They said please do not go.  \n\tThe other members of the defence unit were at the forefront, because the people who were with us didn't want us to leave.  We said they should leave, we will follow, we will follow after. Then we escaped from the comrades to join the rest of the group.\n\tThe first place we went to was at Leratong, it is a tavern.  We found comrades there and they told us they had been inside already and they didn't find anybody.  We left and we went to BJ, that is Black Joint. It is a tavern also, belonging to Sister Mosake. \n\tWhen I entered the tavern I met the people I left in the country when I went to exile.  They were happy. They were asking me how it was and I explained to them. At that moment there was a time where I talked to the owner of the tavern and she called her daughter to come and talk to me.  She showed me Benjamin, and I left the comrades and I went to Benjamin. I asked Benjamin what was happening. Instead of answering me, he left for the door, and Phule Alusi approached and Benjie grabbed him and I pulled him back.  We fell on the ground. I stood up very quickly and I kicked him and I searched him and I realised he was not armed, and we went outside the tavern on the stoep. I gripped him and he fell. I took stones, I wanted to hit him with stones.  One of these girls working at the tavern, Sono, stopped me.  As she stopped me he escaped and he ran away and I chased him with other comrades.  \t\n\tThen we went back.  We couldn't catch him.  When we got back to the yard, there were many fights going on and a person shouted at me, he said here's the other one, and when I went to see, it was a girl Lesi, and she was fighting with another comrade Benjamin, when I arrived at the scene Benjamin was hitting the deceased with a stone on the chest and I said let us go because our mission is not successful, it is better to leave.  That is when we left and we went to Mamma Moloi's place and she washed Benjie's blood and she stopped the blood that was - she stopped the bleeding, and they didn't allow us to leave because they thought we were going to continue fighting.\n\tAt about 09:10 in the morning we left.  I had to pass Benjamin Cholota's place.  His father was standing at the gate and he called us and we went to him, and he asked us what did we do, because the police were looking for us.  What I said to him, was we fought and he said no, you should know the police were here looking for you, they were looking for you for murder, you have shot a person.  And we were surprised how we shot a person because we didn't have a firearm in our possession, and we didn't even have any knobkierie in our possession, and I was surprised that the police were looking for us for murder.  Benjamin's father said you should stay and wait for the police.  We stayed there until one o'clock waiting for the police but they didn't come.  \n\tWe decided to leave and see one of our comrades.   From his place we were actually going to the deceased's family to discuss the incident that took place the previous day and the police approached, they produced their guns and they said hands-up and they arrested me.  They asked me where Benjamin was. I pointed Benjamin and they arrested him too.",

With your permission I would like to give a brief address on behalf of applicant No 2, that is Simon Moalosi.  \n\tMay it please the Chairman and members of the Committee.  We have just heard evidence by the applicant which its nature is that No 1, he was a member of the Correctional Services which was then called Prison Services. In terms of Section 1 of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, security forces is defined as including members of the Department of Correctional Services.  So I will argue that he fits the category of the definition of the Act. \n\tHe committed a gross violation of human rights, that is killing as defined in the Act, and he has adduced evidence to that effect.  The applicant also believed that the ANC supporters were his enemy.  He also adduced evidence to this effect that during one of the stayaways, which was called by supporters of the UDF or African National Congress, he did not heed the stayaway call.  As a result he was assaulted by ANC supporters, who viewed him as an enemy. \n\tThe applicant's act, I would argue, that it is associated with a political objective because it was clear that at that time in Parys, Tamahole township, the ANC supporters were hostile towards him, because they viewed him as the enemy. In fact, the act was committed in the course of the conflict between the ANC supporters and those who did not support the ANC.  One would appreciate the fact that one, if you are a member of the community at Tamahole, you were either regarded as a comrade or an enemy.  Unfortunately for the applicant he fell on the side of the enemy. As a result of this conflict. \n\tAlthough he committed the offence without an order or an instruction as required by the Act, it was clear that if he did not defend himself at that time against his political rivals or opponents, he would have been seriously injured or killed.  He didn't know what would happen the following day because there was this tag hanging on him, that he was an enemy.\n\tIn conclusion, Mr Chairman, I have briefly stated that the situation in Tamahole at that time was that one would be either on the side of the comrades or the security forces, as defined in the Act.  The applicant has so identified himself as an enemy, because he never heeded to the calls of UDF supporters or ANC members.\n\tWith your permission, Mr Chairman, I would like to narrate an extract from the ANC's statement, which was submitted to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.",

If I may read the code therefrom, which reads:\n\"The forms of armed action and self-defence activity varied. The march revolutionary violence of the people, units to protect leaders of people's committees and democratic organisations.  A system of patrolling the streets and warning signals, units to harass enemy patrols, attacks on enemy encampments, alienation of agents ...\"\nAnd which is relevant to this matter, is -\n\"... procurement of weapons.\"\nThis was also confirmed in the latest submission where questions were put to ANC leaders as to their role and connection with the SDUs. They confirmed this position, but they admitted that in other instances things went wrong, because these structures were manned by members of the communities themselves.  They were not controlled by the headquarters of the ANC.  \n\tSo one would appreciate that in all this conflicts of the past, one would appreciate that number one, there was a conflict of the past.  Secondly, when addressing the conflict of the past by either party, something would go wrong, as it has been accused by all the applicants. \n\tIn short, Mr Chairman, I wanted to highlight that in respect of applicant Nos 1 and 3, they responded to a call made by the ANC, that communities should defend themselves. As to the nitty-gritty and the rules of how one should conduct such operations, it was left to the communities.  That is why we are here today, listening to people giving their experiences of the conflict of the past.  \n\tIn regard to applicant No 2, a question was asked to him, whether he still regards applicant 1 and 2 as enemies, and he answered no, because of the changes which took place in South Africa and he thought that the spirit of reconciliation should prevail.  \n\tThank you, Mr Chairman.",

From their evidence it appears that they acted, they assaulted Mr Plaatjies, in furtherance of the ANC as an organisation, and as my learned friend has read the ANC policy, I have no objections to that. I mean, it is an ANC, it is the organisation which has today stated its policy.  However, I think the question as well is, was Mr Plaatjies the enemy; was he one of the people who acted against the ANC. Unfortunately we have no evidence to the contrary, to the effect that Mr Plaatjies was not a gang member. We have heard the evidence of the sister, but as she gave her evidence, it became apparent that she can't say with certainty whether what the activities of Mr Plaatjies were.",

That, his evidence was that they had gone to the tavern to enjoy themselves and that this happened when they were leaving, which I think supports the conclusion that he probably was - are you prepared to accept that he was under the influence?",
