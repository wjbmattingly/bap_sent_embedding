            "CHAIRPERSON",
            "Thank you.  Mr Khumalo, thank you very much.  What is going to happen, the three of us here are going to sit down, decide and after we have made our decision it will be written, because the Act requires us, the Act that brought us here, the Act that has brought our existence actually, requires us that the decision that we give should be in writing.  Your attorney, Mr Mbandazayo, will be provided with a copy and another copy will come to you, do you understand that?\n\tWe will try our utmost that we don't delay it unduly.  We will do everything in our power to give the decision as soon as possible, but it has to be written.  The same here, Mr Coetzer, we've got to give a written decision and it shall be sent to you shortly, so in other words what I'm saying is that our decision is reserved.  We thank you for having come, Mr Khumalo.\n\tI notice it's just about ten to eleven and I hope Mr Kachelhoffer it will be appropriate to have tea at this time.  Thank you.  We shall adjourn for tea for 15 minutes.\nCOMMITTEE ADJOURNS",
