<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Chairman, I ...[indistinct] this applicant.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>	Mr Chairman, I'll call Moalusi Morrison.  As I indicated	I still have the same predicament.  It's the only application form I had regarding this incident for him.  I will call him just to confirm the affidavit of Abel Khotle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Morrison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you hear Mr Morrison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MOALUSI MORRISON:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your full names please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> Moalusi Morrison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>	Mr Morrison, do you confirm that you have read the affidavit of Abel Lerato Khotle, the first applicant in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> Yes, I had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> And you also want it to be taken as part of your evidence that you are going to give here in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Morrison, just one aspect before I leave it to the Committee to ask you questions.  Mr Khotle in his affidavit indicates that he jumped from the kombi somewhere near Thaba'Nchu and you drove away. Can you tell the Committee what happened after you drove away, when you were alone now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> When we arrived at Thaba'Nchu after comrade Lerato had alighted from the vehicle I approached a cul-de-sac.  I drove for about 15 metres away and I couldn't move on.  I jumped off and I left the car.  I couldn't go on beyond the cul-de-sac.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> What eventually happened to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> I took cover because the police surrounded the area and I couldn't escape.  The police from Bophuthatswana, South African Police surrounded the area.  I stayed there where I took cover until past eight and past nine and the owner of the yard went to report to the police and he told the police that I was in his place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> And you were arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> And is it also true that you were charged with Abel Khotle in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> When?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Let me put it this way.  Eventually after the case was withdrawn against you, after you have been charged, you were re-arrested and charged again for this matter and you stood trial together with Abel Khotle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> And that you were acquitted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, that is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MBANDAZAYO</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think there are one or two things which ought to be put on record, which has not gone on yet because he hasn't put up and affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>	Mr Morrison, were you a member of the PAC and of APLA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> That is so, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And were you in the logistics department and primarily responsible for transport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And in this context were you involved in the attack on the Wesselsbron Supermarket and on the King William's Town Golf Club Attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> Please repeat that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In the logistics department, were you connected with and implicated in the Wesselsbron Supermarket and the attack on the King William's Town Golf Club, that you transported the weapons that were used in those two attacks, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you were an ...[inaudible] in your logistic department?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>	Mr Morrison, the victims in this matter are opposing your application and their contention is you started to shoot at the police after realising you were followed by the police and you tried to get away.  You were scared to be arrested and prosecuted for this case?  What is your comment on this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> It's not that I was running away from being arrested but what was important was I had information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you wish to continue the struggle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> I had no chance to go on.  Those who were left behind were to go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But on this occasion you were not prepared to meekly give up, you wanted to continue the struggle that APLA was conducting against the government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> I was arrested.  When I was arrested, the people who were behind would continue the struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you didn't want to be arrested, that's why you drove your vehicle as you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MORRISON:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, that is the case of the applicants Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, if there is no inconvenience I would suggest if possible we could start with the other matter as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] have argument on both matters tomorrow then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> As you please Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I certainly don't think that this is a matter that warrants an adjournment for written argument or for obtaining the copy of the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>	Very well, are we in a position to continue?  Are you in a position to start the next matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, I'm in a position to start Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is the matter of the application by Lerato Abel Khotle and Mosiuwa Isaia Khotle.  It has been named: The Killing Of Botshabelo Police.  Is that the application which is now to be heard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And all the parties remain the same?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, at this stage I will call Abel Khotle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, may I be so rude as to interrupt for a moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Go ahead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, I would suggest that if possible, the victims are not here, they will be here early tomorrow morning, but in the meantime this applicant or maybe both the applicants can finish their testimonies, that I can maybe just for a moment speak to the victims if possible.  They can both testify, if it's possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So the victims have not been notified the matter may be heard today?  They've been given notice for tomorrow have they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> That's correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In the light of that, I don't think it would be proper for us to start hearing evidence today which the victims may well consider of some importance to them.  Although they are not going to cross-examine themselves it may well be that they would like to hear what happened, what caused the suffering and the damage that they incurred.  I think rather let us commence when they are here tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> As you wish Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's been suggested to me that you might like to argue the present application.  Have you any argument?  I take it you are going to say that this was part of the struggle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Definitely, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, the only view of the victims is that there was no political motive and it was a ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] to escape, is that not a political motive, if you're engaged in a struggle against the government of the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> That may very well be so Mr Chairman, but that is not the view of the victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, but you have nothing further you wish to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Nothing further, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, one more question.  Somebody gave us an extract to read ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> ...[inaudible] Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] 09H30 tomorrow morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Yes, it will ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] to give you an opportunity to see the victims when they arrive tomorrow and talk to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
