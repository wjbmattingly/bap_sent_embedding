            "Yes, Chairperson.  I was going to conclude by referring you to some attempts which were made by ourselves to try to obtain more information which could shed light on some of the issues that had been raised in cross-examination here, particularly in regard to the incident which took place and which Mr Jagga confirmed that he had heard about from the Lesotho police, that there was a shooting on a road somewhere and Chairperson, although we haven't got copies, may I read to you a letter written by my attorney, Wagener, on the 8th of November and it is a letter directed to the Commissioner of the Royal Lesotho Mounted Police, Maseru, Lesotho and it says\n\"Dear Sir, I represent a number of ex-members of the South African Police in their applications for amnesty to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and this letter is addressed to you on behalf of such clients, in a matter that is at present partly heard and which will proceed in Bloemfontein on 13 November 2000.  A dispute has arisen regarding an incident which took place during 1987 within your jurisdiction, namely the following:  (1) towards the end of 1987 and near Mafikeng, members of your department set up an official road block, (2) the driver of one vehicle failed to act correctly and a shoot-out followed killing one passenger and wounding another, (3) the wounded, a certain Atwell Maqhekeza was taken to the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital in Maseru for treatment, (4) however the following day the said injured passenger was shot and killed inside the hospital, (5) the exact date and particulars of the said incident are now in dispute.  In view of the aforesaid, you are kindly requested to forward me on an urgent basis, the following particulars:  (1) the date of the incident, (2) I am told that someone was later arrested and charged for the murder in the hospital, particulars thereof are also required, (3) the particulars of the road block,\nif available, are also required.  I look forward to your kind assistance herein.\"\nMr Jagga, as I am now told it is pronounced, Chairperson, took this matter up with the Lesotho police and discussed it with someone there, I don't know with whom and he was told that a letter has to be written in which the information was formally required and it is for that reason that this letter was addressed to the Commissioner.  Now I'm sad to inform you, Chairperson, that there has been absolutely no reaction and no result.  Mr Jagga, is still attempting to pursue the matter and I've understood from what Mr Malindi said yesterday, that they have also made attempts to pursue the matter, so it seems that the sign on the wall is, the writing on the wall is that we're not going to get an information and it's sad that that is so, because that could have established one way or the other, objectively some part of the evidence which we're now obviously going to have to do without, Chairperson.\n\tThat being so, that is the evidence which we propose to present to you in support of the applications of the four applicants for their amnesty in the present incidents and so to speak, that's the case for the applicant.",

At this stage, Chairperson, we prefer not to divulge which annals of this case we are investigating.  A little bit of progress has been made, but we have not been able to finalise consultations with the people who could help in those aspects of this matter.  I may just indicate that we are forming a view and if our opinion is correct, at one or another stage we will, depending on whether we obtain the information we are endeavouring to get, we will bring an application for the re-opening of this matter, that's if in these proceedings it's permissible, but we see no reason why in the normal criminal and civil trials, such provisions are possible and failing which, we will follow other procedures to make sure that whatever we uncover is used for the benefit especially of the victims in this matter.  So the short and long of it Chairperson, is that our ...(indistinct) was, we are unable to divulge even to the Committee at this stage, except if we are required to do so in Chambers.",

I think we can take it up at a later stage, but what you have just alluded to, it's your right and the victim's right, but may I just bring to your attention that whatever you propose to do in future, you have this at the back of your mind, the last time the Amnesty Committee had a meeting, is that this is the last month where hearings are conducted and in terms of the Act that brought us into being, is that we've got to write a codicil, finalising all the process of the TRC per se and such process or the writing of the codicil, will be completed by March next year and the following month, or the same month, I'm not now very certain of my facts, is that it would be presented to the President and that would be announcing our death in terms of the Act and should there be some process or something whilst this is in process should happen, take into account that in December I'm assuming duties at the TPD, my Judge President is impatient with me, so effectively I'm with the Amnesty Committee up to the end of this month, so I want you just to be aware of some of these things and it is your right, I wouldn't bear upon you or put pressure upon you to divulge what you think is confidential and you are still doing investigations, but I should thank you as well, together with your attorney, that I'm most indebted to you, to the legal representatives, they have approached this matter with all diligence and trying to assist where there are deficiencies, that is most appreciated by my Panel.

Chairperson, today we propose to call members of the families of the four people that disappeared in this matter.  Chairperson, they are going to be very short witnesses, I don't propose to make an opening address because the purpose of their testimony will come out of their own evidence.  Briefly, it is just to establish that contact was maintained, though erratic, between the disappeared and their families and that from December 1987 none of them made further contact with their families and our submission will therefore be that were they returned into Lesotho, they would have made some contact as they used to before and that is the basis on calling the witnesses and I hope that it is necessary, we believe it is necessary to call them, Chairperson.\n\tChairperson then in as far as Ngulelo Ngono, the evidence that will be led will indicate that he had contact with his family post December 1987 and that our submission in that respect will be that he was not taken to Ladybrand in December, but his disappearance was as a result of subsequent operations and not related to the other three.

It just occurred to me that Mr Mapoma might quite rightly think that I was criticising him, but that wasn't the point at all, although I must tell you that we've been constantly surprised by the way in which the Amnesty process has happened, that you find yourself confronted with multiple opponents for the same victims, but we've let that go by, Chairperson, we haven't made any point and nor are we making any point about it today.  The only point here was that on what seemed to be a crucial issue, among all these people, nobody ever put it to anybody and that is the only point which I was trying to make, it was not meant as criticism against Mr Mapoma.  In any Commission of Inquiry, you always have a Leader of Evidence whose duty, as we understand the law, has always been to assist the Committee either for or against the applicant, although I must say in this process it's always against the applicants, but be that as it may, but I am certainly not criticising Mr Mapoma in the role that he played here and I hope that that will be accepted as not having been criticism about him.",

            "... Major Busisiwe Benedikatha Buthelezi.  This would appear, it's faxed from the South African National Defence, it's easy to trace that person.  I am interested in Nathaniel Mona Mtunya.  It is my view also in addition to what I said to counsel in chamber that Tsietsi Mokhele is apparently alive and somewhere around, I want to hear him as well.  I don't know from these which I have identified, that is Khadi Lindelwa Mabece and Trevor James Tsepo Pitso, if any of the legal representatives would be interested in those people, but I have identified them at least for anybody, other than the people you would come with.  What I want us to do and I've implored the legal representatives, that time is of the essence, that if there is a legal representative who wants somebody to be subpoenaed by the TRC, please do so as soon as possible.  As matters stand, we have now established that this matter, there won't be argument, this matter will be further heard between the 4th and 8th December 2000 at JISS Centre, Joe has undertaken to make all the logistical arrangements, but apparently a venue which he could obtain is JISS Centre, Mayfair Johannesburg where we actually started and it will continue from the 4th to the 8th.  I'm mindful that there are the municipality elections on the 5th and if that is declared a public holiday, people are free to go and vote, I don't want to stand in the way of anybody's constitutional right to case his vote for whichever party he prefers.  And because I have mentioned a few people, could we have an agreement that on the 4th we start at 9.00 a.m. at Jiss Centre, on the 4th of December 2000?  So this matter will stand adjourned to the 4th of December at JISS Centre, but I must firstly say and I want to say this to the people of this church, that thank you very much for the venue and the treatment we have received.  I have to start doing exercises because I'm bulging because of the nice food here.  Thank you very much it is most appreciated.\n\tThank you to the legal representatives.  I may have been quiet most of the time, but your assistance has been invaluable.  That is highly appreciated and I'm also indebted that this is done in the spirit in which it is done normally and that is gratifying to me, speaking for myself.\n\tI want to thank the translators. I think you thought you would go home early for the Christmas holidays.  I'm sorry to call you back on the 4th, but thank you for your assistance and if I have stretched you, it was not intentional it was because I was busy with what I had before me and time was, in most instances, not my priority and that is my biggest weakness, I don't look at time when do you finish work, but bear with me, take it that I was not punishing you, your assistance is highly appreciated.\n\tTo the victims, I would say, you have been at JISS Centre, you came here and you stayed throughout in attendance.  Thank you for the attendance.  The rest I will conclude with a JISS Centre when we are concluding this matter because I know for now, there is a gripe that we don't know what happened to our victims, but it is not time for me now to comment on that at this juncture. \n\tI am not forgetting the applicants.  Thank you for coming in and Mr Robertshaw, you showed great interest.  You stayed in throughout.  Thank you, if we have taken you away from your work, we thank you for your co-operation you've shown.  \n\tWe will adjourn now until the 4th of December 2000 at JISS Centre.",

Let me just place on record, we have no interest in people like Khadi and so on, in fact we would have argued that his evidence was irrelevant to this application anyway, so we would not add to that list as present advised.  Chairperson, there remain two things, one is through the efforts of Mr Mapoma, for which we thank him, he has obtained a photocopy, or rather a fax from which photocopies have been made of the original statement taken from Ms Thobeka Ngono and for completeness of the record, could we ask you to accept that as Exhibit G?  My Learned Friend Mr Mapoma, has assured me that he's compared that statement to the statement which appears in your bundle, and it's identical, so it is handed to you for you to check for yourself, if you wish and then lastly Chairperson - Oh if there aren't copies, please take mine.  Chairperson last issue is we would obviously need a record because it's most helpful, particularly during Argument and it often serves as to avoid arguments as to what witnesses said or didn't say.  Could you perhaps use your auspices in order to ensure that we might be able to get a record of these proceedings for these past two days as soon as possible, so that we can be properly prepared when we appear before you again on the 4th of December?",
