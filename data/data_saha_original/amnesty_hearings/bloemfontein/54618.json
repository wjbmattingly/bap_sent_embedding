Mr Chairman, you will recall that at the conclusion of the previous hearing, it was directed that a pre-hearing meeting would be held.\n\tThe pre-hearing meeting was held at Pretoria on Monday, the 18th of August 1997 and was chaired by the Honourable Member of the Committee, Mr De Jager.  I believe that you have minutes of the pre-hearing before yourselves and I wish to refer you to page 3 of the minute.\n\tThe offences referred to under paragraph 2 therein, that is 2.1, the murder of Mr Venter and 2.2 the kidnapping of White Mohapi, have been dealt with and completed.  At the time of the adjournment we were busy with the application in respect of the offence listed as 2.7, the murder of the UDF activist Papie.\n\tWe propose that it would not be practical to simply continue from where we stopped and that we should just proceed de novo with this application as if no evidence was led at all.\n\tWe have also singled out offences 2.5 and 2.6 as being non-gross violations and we propose that no evidence be led here in respect of these matters and that you hear these matters and determine these matters in Chambers.\n\tThere is of course the difficulty that it is denied by certain members of the police who would have given these instructions, that these instructions were given within the course and scope of duty and we do not know then how you would deal with that as the Committee.",

We detained plus minus 40 - 45 comrades from different houses.\n\tAt the time when we were busy arresting or detaining them,  we broke the doors from various houses and the window panes of those house from those we didn't find them in the houses.  We assaulted or beat members of the families so that they should tell us the whereabouts of those we wanted and they were not in the houses.\n\tAfter we detained them all, all those comrades, we took them to Botshabelo police station, where we detained them at the controlled yard at Botshabelo police station.\n\tWarrant Officer Mbanjani as the person who was working in Botshabelo, was the one who was identifying those he thought were leaders of the comrades, among those who were detained.  Colonel Stevenson asked those comrades who were detained as whether they would govern Botshabelo.\n\tWhen they didn't respond to his questions, he said members of the Riot Squad should bring the plastic sjamboks.  When they arrived with those plastic sjamboks, Warrant Officer Mbanjani instructed those comrades to undress themselves and that they should be naked in other words.\n\tAnd that they should form a circle.  And then again, members of the Riot Squad should form a circle and that the comrades should run around that circle, whilst they were beaten with those sjamboks.  They were beaten on the head, on the body, everywhere where we able to beat them.\n\tAfter they were tired to run around and after we have assaulted them for some time, Warrant Officer Killian and Warrant Officer Koka said we should change the method of assaulting or beating or torturing.\n\tHe said we should tie the knots on the ends of those sjamboks.  After we have tied those knots, we should hit those comrades on their private parts.  Because of hitting them with those knots on the private parts, some of the comrades were bleeding on their private parts.\n\tSome of them, their private parts were swollen.  Whilst they were screaming and holding their private parts, Warrant Officer Mbanjani said we should instruct them to make exercises and then each comrade should do 100 push ups and frog jumps and other kinds of exercises which we are able to make them do.\n\tIf they are not able to complete 100 push ups, we should start again to beat and kick them.

And members who were active, who belonged to SRC and COSAS, were victimised by the Eagles Club and the cooperation they received from that particular school.\n\tThose members of the SRC were supposed to be dismissed or be suspended because of their political activity and the members of the Eagles Club would receive protection from the police and to be armed by them to proceed with the work in schools and to disrupt the meetings.\n\tThe people I know who were recruited to continue with that objective who were members of the Eagles Club was Papie Mokalake, Butie Sentso and the other one I know him only as Sello and Search Kotoane and all these members were informers of the Security Branch who received monies from us at the Headquarters in Bloemfontein.\n\tThe other group which we were able to establish, was Anti-comrade which was formed by members of the Security Branch together with Morgan Phehlane who was a Councillor in Brandfort.\n\tIn this group we used people who were criminals.  They were recruited from prison.  They were recruited by a certain Sergeant, called Sergeant Mokalake who was working with this Anti-comrade gang so that they should join this gangster.  He was the senior person in that Anti-comrade group together with the Security Branch.\n\tThe work of this gangster as it was formulated by the Security Branch, was to deal with political organisations like United Democratic Front and Civic Organisations which were in that area.  And these people were supposed to confront these people in their recreational facilities and in shebeens and in disco places where many members of political organisations were drinking.\n\tIf there is a fight, members of the Security Branch would find a chance to take part in that fight so that they would find an opportunity, people who were regarded as the enemy, and that they would do the cover up for those cases by using members of the Anti-comrades so that they should be given arms and knives and plant them on the bodies of those people, so that they were able to cover up those murders.\n\tOther incidents which I am able to remember, done by the Anti-comrade group was the murder of Papie Steyn, who was killed by Sergeant Mokalake and his son who is Papie Mokalake.  That I would call a joint attack, which was done by members of the Anti-comrades and members of the Eagles Club.\n\tAfter they had killed Papie Steyn, members of the Security Branch covered up the case.  Because Warrant Officer Ramoseu instructed the Investigating Officer who was handling the case, that he should try that this case should not succeed so that it would put Sergeant Mokalake in danger.\n\tThey paid the legal cost, so that they should help Sergeant Mokalake in court.
