Evidently after accused 1, that is now Mr Ngo, was in the motor car accident of which he testified himself, and in which he sustained certain injuries.\n\tAccording to Dr Van Niekerk, the accused sustained back fractures as well as a neck injury.  Due to the neck injury he was kept for a week at the trauma unit of Pelanomi Hospital. \n\tAfter he had spent the week at the Hospital, he was released and was prescribed four weeks bed rest.  During a later follow up consultation visit, it was determined that the fracture of the back for which the accused was operated initially, collapsed.\n\tOn the 21st of October 1988, an operation was done known as a Harrington Procedure, during which two steel plates, pegs, were placed into the accused's neck to pull his head straight.\n\tRegarding Dr Van Niekerk, accused 1, that is Mr Ngo, was transported from Pelanomi Hospital or rather was released from Pelanomi Hospital during approximately November 1988.\n\tCapt Khoja, if we take account of this, it seems that Mr Ngo was for most of the time from July 1988 to November 1988 in hospital?
