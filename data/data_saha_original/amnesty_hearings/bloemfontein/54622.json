It is the case that the reason for the delay this morning was because of the fact that there was a bit of a dispute, but let's rather call it a difference of opinion between myself and the representative of the Truth Commission, with regard to the amount of my claim to which I am entitled to where the representative of the Truth Commission is not willing to pay out this claim.\n\tAnd if one looks at the guidelines of the legal aid and with regard to the Truth Commission situation, I have already told you this morning that I have not been remunerated in any way and the position at present Chairperson, is that I am not able to make my services available to the people who are now prejudiced in this whole incident because I'm not going to be remunerated as I would have thought.\n\tBut I don't have any other choice than to inform that in the first instance, I'm sorry for the delay that this has caused but this is the situation that we have tried to sort out since October but even up to today, it has not been sorted out and therefore I have no other choice than to withdraw myself as the attorney on record on behalf of all the people that I represent.",

The Truth Commission says it pays a certain amount per day and Mr Stander wanted the Truth Commission to pay higher.  The Truth Commission said: \"We cannot pay higher because all our lawyers would demand that amount as we pay per individual case\".\n\tMr Stander said: \"If you are not going to pay me the amount I've demanded, it is better for me to withdraw because the Truth Commission cannot pay that amount because it will cause problems - that lawyers all over the country would demand that amount Mr Stander was looking for.\n\tThe Truth Commission has it's own layers who are permanent employees of the Truth Commission, who help victims without lawyers.  The other one is Mr Mpshe, the other one is Mr Brink and they are employed by the Truth Commission for victims who come here without lawyers will be helped by them.  \n\tIn other cases you'd find that there are victims who have lawyers but don't have money, therefore the Truth Commission will be able to pay that lawyer but that lawyer should accept the money or the amount paid by the Truth Commission.  Mr Stander didn't agree with that part of payment, then we told you that lawyers who are employed by the Truth Commission would be able to represent you, then you said you don't want that lawyer.\n\tAgain after that, you said you are withdrawing, then you spoke to Mr Mthembu.  Mr Mthembu was representing Mr Ngo and Mr Motsamai and he's afraid that if he's going to represent you, further down the evidence of the two applicants will be in accord with your evidence and in that case there will be a problem of conflict of interest, do you understand?  \n\tI'm not deciding on your behalf.  If you want your evidence to be in front of this Committee, it would be better to use the lawyers who are hired by the Truth Commission.  They go to all the sittings around the country to represent victims like you who are not able to afford lawyers.  If you want that lawyer to represent you, it's up to you.  \n\tYou should understand why Mr Stander withdrew - the money he wanted or he claimed was too much and the Truth Commission was not able to pay.  If the Truth Commission agreed to pay that amount to Mr Stander, it would create some problems in the future because all of them - all lawyers who are representing victims, should be paid equal amounts.  \n\tWhat do you think now?

As COSAS we organised that gathered for midday at ...[indistinct] High School and our parents would hold the same memorial service in the afternoon of that same day at church, it was at the AME church.\n\tAs I explained earlier on we were going to commemorate during the day and at night it would be our parents.  Then we elected people among ourselves to go and mobilise, to go and inform other students to come to this meeting at 2 o'clock.  To us as students this prayer meeting did not materialise because the policemen chased us and we could not meet together as planned. \n\tBut the same day late at night we gathered at Vulamasango to meet with the parents as they carry on with the prayer which was at the AME church.  The meeting went on that evening and after that prayer the elderly people requested the youth to go carefully and not pester the police at all.  Even if we sing, we shouldn't sing any song that will lead the policemen to beat us.  We then went out of the meeting, there were people who were singing but I was not amongst the group who were singing. \n\tWe took a road leading to Botshabelo, I forgot the name of the street.  Before we could enter Botshabelo - we were between the two locations, Bato and Botshabelo, there was a police van called a \"Mellow-Yellow\" which came to us driving very slowly.  I was together with my sister-in-law and I was telling her the events of my arrest.  \n\tAs we were talking the police van drove very slowly and one person from inside called my name, he said: \"Yes Matthews, you are a springbuck\" and my sister-in-law said: \"Please don't get into an argument with these people, they're trying to provoke you, just ignore them\".  I did ignore them, I did not even see this person who was shouting my name.  \n\tWe got right into Botshabelo until at St Peter's church in Pahaleng.  Just when we approached the church this \"Mellow-Yellow\" that I've referred to, blocked the road.  People were still singing but singing peacefully.  The road was blocked, so we had to walk on the tarred road.  There's a street - I just happen to forget the name of the street but it was close to the tavern, when we were approaching that street the police came with their van, they got out of the car and people ran into different directions.  I was left alone.  \n\tOne policeman who came to arrest me was Nkosi - I do not remember his first name but there were two, it was Nkosi and the other one.  Now Nonsololo my sister-in-law was asking them where they were taking me to, now there was no reply.  They chased her away.  \n\tI see a name of a policeman here: Ramulefi, this is the policeman who came out.  Lukani whom I referred to earlier on and the other policeman took me to the van and he said to them: \"Leave this child, we are not going to be troubled by such a small boy\".  While trying to listen to what this person was going to say further, a shot went off and I do not remember what happened thereafter.  I was shot at the ear.",
