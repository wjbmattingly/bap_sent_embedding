Although that was a separate application, the two applicants in the present application were involved in that application, and it would appear from the papers, the same political parties are involved.  In these circumstances, in the light of the fact that we heard considerable evidence as to the aims of the political party, particularly the aims at that particular time and the aims of the persons who were members of the party, it will not be necessary for the applicants in the present application to lead similar evidence.  We will have regard to the evidence that has already been put before us.  A further reason for arriving at this decision is that the present incident is directly connected with the application that we have just concluded.
