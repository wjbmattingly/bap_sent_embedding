            "It is now the 21st of August.  The Committee remains unchanged, as do the Leader of Evidence and the legal representative of the applicants.  \tThe matter set down for hearing today has been referred to, in the bundle of papers given to us, as: The Killing Of The Botshabelo Police.  I understand however, from the applicants' counsel, that there is no application before us in respect of the killing of the police.  That the application before us is an application for amnesty in respect of the Robbery At The Botshabelo Pep Stores.\n\tI don't know how this mistake came about but obviously it was as a result of this that the widows of the three policemen who were subsequently killed were given notice that the application would heard by us and that they were victims.  \n\tWe adjourned the matter yesterday because we were informed that they had been told the matter would be heard today and we felt it wrong to proceed in their absence.  They are not here today.  The representatives of the TRC have gone to Botshabelo to find them and have been able to make contact with one of them only, who was apparently at her place of work near the police station in Botshabelo.  It has been explained to her that there is no application pending in respect of the shooting of the policemen and she is accordingly, as I understand it, going back to her work and the other two people will not be present.  It therefore seems that we can proceed with the hearing.  \n\tI would like it to be placed on record that I am correct in what I have said about the fact that the applicants, two applicants, are only applying for amnesty in respect of the incident at the Botshabelo Pep Store.",

We will have regard to that evidence.\n\tIt does appear however that the policies of the party were somewhat different when this incident took place at the beginning of 1992.  I'm now referring to the Judgment delivered at his trial where evidence was apparently led by the applicant that, or in a statement made, that it was not the policy of the APLA at that stage to use violence and injure people during the course of such operations.",
