<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>	Mr Mazete, you have an affidavit in front of you which is also before the Committee.  Do you confirm that the affidavit which is before you was made by yourself and you abide by its contents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Chairman, I will go to paragraph 6 of the affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>	Mr Mazete, I'll read the second line, the third line of paragraph 6:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>"I confirm that I drew up the map of the Wesselsbron Supermarket at the request of comrade Bhani.  I also confirm that the arms were left in my place after the operation, though I did not know when they left them.  I then realised after I heard of the attack, that the map I drew up and the arms that were dropped at my place on the day of the attack, were used in the operation at Wesselsbron"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>I want you Mr Mazete, to take the Committee starting when you started drawing up the map, your role you played, the circumstances which led you to drawing the map of the Wesselsbron Supermarket.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> As a member of the task force within the PAC, many things which we were taught as members of the task force is that we should know to do reconnaissance and that is why I was able to draw the map.  I think that is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Can you tell the Committee the reason why you drew up this map?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> To add on what I already said, as a member of the task force in every operation or in any work which you're supposed to do as a member of the task force which the organisation wanted to do, that is why I was able to do the map for them, of the supermarket.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you answer the question once again.  Why did you draw up this map?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> It is because I was instructed by comrade Bhani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Did you know the reason why - did he tell you the reason why he instructed you to draw up the map?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Did you ask him: "Why are you saying I must draw up the map of Wesselsbron Supermarket, yet you know it" - I take it that you were all in Wesselsbron.  Didn't you ask him: "Why should I draw up a map when you know the supermarket"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you think you knew why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> After that I thought that he wanted to do something about the map, even if I did not know exactly what.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well about the map or about the Wesselsbron Supermarket?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> About the map.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> After the - let me ask you this way first, did you know that the Wesselsbron Supermarket is to be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> I understand that the weapons, according to your affidavit, is that they dropped weapons after the incident at Wesselsbron Supermarket.  Did you know that when they were dropping the weapons that they were coming from attacking Wesselsbron Supermarket?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, I did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Did they tell you the reason why they were dropping weapons at your place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> They did not tell me, they just request me that I should put those weapons in my house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Can you tell the Committee at what stage you realised that the map and the weapons were used at Wesselsbron?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> After they were arrested and I was arrested, when we were in the police station, that is when I started to know.  That is when I started to know that those things were used for the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> At what stage did you hear about the news of the attack at the Wesselsbron Supermarket?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> On a Sunday the following day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Did you not, after you heard the news, think that this map and the weapons which were dropped were used in the attack, were the ones which were used in the attack?  Did you not suspect that or think about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, I did suspect that they were used for this attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> And you became sure after the arrest, that indeed they were used in the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Chairman, if there are no further questions I will proceed to paragraph 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I have a few questions that I think in the interest of your client we might get.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>	You have told us that comrade Bhani instructed you to draw up this map.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was comrade Bhani a member of any organisation that you knew of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> He was a member of the PAC and APLA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And who dropped the weapons at your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is Bhani, comrade Bhani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I will proceed to paragraph 7 as I indicated Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, do you know - was it discussed with you later, after the attack, how the map which you drew up was of assistance to the people who attacked the supermarket?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, I was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just ask you, the map of the supermarket that you drew up, was that a map of the supermarket inside or was it the location of the supermarket on the streets?  What was this map consisting of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> The inside of the supermarket.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When did he ask you to draw this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> If I remember well I think it was around March or towards the end of March or maybe the beginning of April, towards the end of April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So it was long before the attack, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, not that much.  It's not that long.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, almost three months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> It might be even in May because it was not a long time.  I don't remember well but I don't think it was such a long time, the duration between the drawing of the map and the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did comrade Bhani know the supermarket then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I don't know, but he asked me to draw that map.  I don't know whether he knew the supermarket.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you assist you in drawing up the map?  Did you do it in his presence in other words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, he was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he discuss with you and give you directions while you were drawing the map?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He didn't comment at all, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, he was quiet whilst I was drawing the map.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you know whether he had been into that supermarket himself before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he not tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> He did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Before you drew up the map did you go into the supermarket to check?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> You mean myself or him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> On what basis did you know the supermarket that well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I knew it well because I'm a resident there in the nearby township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you yourself often buy at the supermarket or did you then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, mostly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Regularly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, many times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And other comrades of yours, did they buy there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, because they were residents there in Monyake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So the supermarket was frequented also by APLA and PAC supporters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I don't know members of APLA but members of the PAC used to go, many of them used to go to that supermarkets as it's one of the supermarkets in the surrounding area in Wesselsbron.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Steenkamp indicated that he would be leading evidence that almost 90% of the shoppers at that supermarket were black people, can you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The other 10% I assume would then not be black.  Did you ever see people in uniform at the supermarket when you were shopping?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Sometimes yes, I used to see them during the day and during the night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In the supermarket is the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What uniforms are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> You'd find that those are white people who would dress in khaki uniform.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Police uniform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct, they used to come in their uniform to come and buy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The khaki, was that uniforms or khaki clothes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Those are normal clothes but the way I knew is that they were specific people who used to dress in khaki clothes, that is white people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You're not talking of uniforms, like official police uniforms or officers uniforms?  When you talk about khaki uniforms you're talking about khaki clothes?  Am I hearing you correctly, I don't want to lead you on this, I'm asking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I spoke of normal khaki clothes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do I understand you that this was a busy supermarket, most of the customers were black who lived in the area and there were also some white customers, some in khaki, some policemen, who went there to do their shopping?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Those blacks who used to come there with khaki clothes on are students but many of those who used to clad in khaki clothes are white people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> White students?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I mean black students.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They were black students?  And they were there to do their shopping?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that is correct, they used to come there and buy, maybe after school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the whites came to buy as you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> This supermarket, was it near a taxi rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Please repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Was it near a taxi rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Do you know the last time the taxi would leave for the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Around 7 o'clock at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, may I proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, just one last question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>	Do you know what time the supermarket closed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What time was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Around 8 o'clock at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I move to paragraph 7, Mr Chairman.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>"I further confirm that I later gave the weapons to Paulos Mohlolo Mohape for safekeeping.  There were people coming to stay with me"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>Now can you tell the Committee, after how long did you give these weapons to Mohape, after the incident?  How long after the incident did you give them to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Around a month.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Did you tell him about these weapons, anything about them, that maybe they were used, the operation or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, I only told him about these weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] told him about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> He only told him about the weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>	Now you told him, what did you him about the weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I said to him that he should help me to keep them safe because there were people who would be coming.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> How long after the incident at Wesselsbron Supermarket were you arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Approximately four months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Mazete, it transpired during evidence before the court, if I'm not mistaken, that a certain amount was left with you after this incident, after the attack at Wesselsbron Supermarket.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Also can you confirm, were you paid a certain amount of money for keeping the weapons or for assisting in the whole operation at Wesselsbron Supermarket?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now, did you hear about this evidence - coming to my first point, did you hear anything in court about the evidence that an amount of about R9 000 was left with you after the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, I did hear, I made that statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You did what?</p>

Apparently there is no sworn statement that was made or that is available by the applicant.  I'll just continue the questioning of the applicant Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>	Sir, if I look at your amnesty application, to start there, according to my documents, page 19 or at least it's marked page 19, this is the application of George Thabang Mazete, and to paragraph 9(a) there, I see you're referring to an incident which happened on the 22nd of October 1993.  Can I repeat the question for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, would you repeat please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Looking at your amnesty application, page 19 which is the first page of your amnesty application, I see there paragraph 9(a) you say this incident apparently occurred on the 22nd of October 1993, is this a mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, that is not so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> So according to you this incident occurred on the 22nd of October 1993, do I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> It did not happen on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> So that is my question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Is this a mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Is this the only mistake in your amnesty application or is there anything else you want to point out which is wrong, or is the rest of your application correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Chairman, if I can just be of help not necessarily on the question, if the applicant can be told that the bundle is before him, take the bundle in front of him and open it, the bundle, not the affidavit. 	Take the bundle, turn to page 19.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Page 19 of the bundle is part of the old application of Khotle, isn't it?  Oh, you're looking at the other bundle?</p>

<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> It might be the one who filled this form but I don't remember his name well.  I don't know the name of the person who filled this form.</p>

<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, I have it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> I'm just going to read from your own application and I just want your comment.  Do you have it in front of you now?</p>

<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Under the heading: "State Political Objective Sought to be Achieved", you said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>"To carry forwards the armed struggle waged by the PAC/APLA at the time at or as, as the Wesselsbron Supermarket was owned by the local chairman of the AWB and frequented by AWB members?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>Do you still stick to this version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, what I know about this is that we were carrying forward the armed struggle for liberation.  As to whether the owner of the shop was the AWB, I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Why did you put it in your amnesty application Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> When I filling this application I didn't include this aspect to say, I only talked about my objective, I did not include that the owner of the shop was a member of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Can you please tell us what your political objective was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> It was to achieve total liberation for the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying that when you filled this form in this paragraph wasn't filled in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I did fill it in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well what did you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I told them about my objective, that is was to achieve total liberation for the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But that is not what is in the form here.  You say that is what was filled in in the form that you signed, that you prepared, as I understand you.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I don't know who put that addition, under which circumstances or reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, what else has been put into this form that you don't know about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> The way it was filled I'm satisfied.  There is nowhere where I have doubts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But the problem is you have told us it was filled in a certain way, the form we have is filled in and they are completely different in context.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> To explain shortly before this Commission, at the time when we were filling these application forms those people who represented us at that time, we were telling them orally and those people were writing or filling those forms.  I did not fill this form by myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you tell those people who were filling in the form</p>

<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because that has been written in the form and then scratched out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, I see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you have your bundle open on page 20?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Chairman, I don't think it has the same number, the one application he is using as yours Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct, I see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you can read what is written there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Do you mean the way it was scratched?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You can see that it's scratched out with a diagonal line there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, I see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And then there's some initial on the left of that scratched our paragraph.  Is that your mark?</p>

<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Is that your mark?</p>

<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you write this?</p>

<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> It's the TRC lawyers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say TRC lawyers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Those who represented the Truth Commission, who consulted people who wanted to apply for amnesty in this province.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> When you were interviewed or when you were being assisted in filling in this form, were you alone?</p>

<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Was it you and the lawyer or was it you, was it a whole group of people and the person who came to take your statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> It was myself and the lawyer and many other people who were filling their forms for amnesty.</p>

<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, we were in the same prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> So were you relating the story as a group to the person who was taking down your statements or were you just giving your statements individually to the person who was taking your statements?</p>

<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Individually to the same person in succession or to different persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> It was the same person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You see Mr Mazete, the difficulty I have is that if I look at your application, the handwriting in which this was filled out I cannot find in any of the other forms.  The handwriting in the other forms, all of them, are totally different.  So it looks as if your document was filled out either by someone with knowledge, on your behalf or directly under your direction by an individual who certainly had by then not taken any of the other statements, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>	Sorry, let me just put this on record.  It's been shown to me that Tshoane's application is in the same handwriting.  That may explain the information that was scratched out, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Can the Committee attach any value to the information that has been submitted to the Committee in your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, they are obliged to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Did you discuss this application, your specific application with your lawyer before coming to the hearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> And did you go through the application, did he go through the application with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> And you were then satisfied that this is actually - you were actually satisfied that this information is correct as far as you were then concerned, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Do you know if any AWB members were killed in this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> May I just have that answer again please, I didn't hear it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> You see Sir, according to paragraph 10(d) you're saying there, I read to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>"Politically and military as one AWB members was killed"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>How should we understand this now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> It shows the way he filled that.  He knew and then we agreed that that is how it happened and those people who were affected were like that, so that is the way I did not dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Sir, isn't it correct that you were never a member of APLA at all?  Because this is what the investigating officer will tell the Committee if he is called.  You were never a member of APLA, you were only there to assist the gang in providing safe housing or a place to store the weapons away, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> So you were never a member of APLA, because this is what you've just said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> So maybe I'm wrong but according to the previous applicants the amount of R4 000 was stolen or taken, robbed, at the supermarket.  You said you received R9 000, do you know where this money came from and who gave it to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No.  As I've already explained before that I didn't know as to whether there was money which was taken there.  And again I was forced by the police to talk about that money so that they would leave me alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Just one question I forgot to ask you, you just said you were never a member of APLA but in your amnesty application in paragraph 7 you stated that you were a member of APLA, why is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I don't know, that is the way it was written.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Returning to the money, do you know what happened to the money, the bulk of the money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Do you know for what purposes money was taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Sir, were you ever a member of PAC?  Am I right to say you were never a member of PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> I don't understand, what is not true?  Are you saying you were never a member of PAC or you were a member of PAC?  I don't understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I was a member of PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Were you a member of APLA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> What was your role in PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I was the General Secretary of the Student Wing, that is PASO.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you a member of the task force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Can you tell me exactly what your role was in this whole incident?  What exactly was required from you to do, in this incident?  Exactly what was your responsibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> In the first place I drew the map of the supermarket and from there I hid their weapons which were used in that operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> And that's all, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Did any of the other people who were involved in the shooting inside the supermarket, some of your co-applicants, did they report back to you what happened in the supermarket?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> When did you realise that the shooting incident occurred in the supermarket, when for the first time did you realise something happened in the supermarket?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> The following day, that is on Sunday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> How did you get to know this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> By rumours, that such an incident happened in town and by seeing many policemen within the township, then I believed that that kind of an incident happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Did you have any idea why the supermarket was attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, I don't have knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Would you say, as a PAC member, that this was a legitimate target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Do you know what the PAC police was on identification of targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> You joined - according to your statement you joined the PAC or PASO in 1990/1991, did anybody inform you what the function or the policy of the PAC was at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Since I joined the PAC in 1990, some of the people I joined with or I joined by or through them, told me all about PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> But you're not able today to tell us what the policy of the PAC was, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Your question was whether he had any knowledge of the PAC's policy in terms of targets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you concluded your questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, I've got one or two, just basically one question left.  I was just trying to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>	Sir, my last question to you.  Can you just briefly tell the Committee what your political motivation was for your part in this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> My political motivation on this incident was because the PAC was engaged in war for liberation at that time, the work of the Military Wing which is APLA, was that to bring the PAC close to liberation for the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> But what was your personal political motivation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> To fight for liberation for the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Mazete, may I just ask you, you say the arms that were used when brought back to you stayed with you for about a month, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was it ever used for any other project, other attack during that month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did nobody come to ask the weapons of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So to the best of your knowledge after this incident those who attacked the supermarket as part of the liberation struggle did not carry out any other action for at least a month and for as long as the arms were with Mr Mohape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I don't remember well, but I don't think they were used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Well you would certainly remember whether they were used while in your possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> They were not used at all for another operation whilst they were with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That's between the attack of the supermarket and your giving it to Mr Paulos Mohape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just one matter I'm a little confused about.  Do you remember during the course of your evidence your counsel asked you about evidence that</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>R9 000 was left with you and you replied: "I made that statement"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where did you make that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> To the Chief Magistrate of Welkom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You made a statement to the Chief Magistrate of Welkom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In which you said that you had been given R9 000?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I told him so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you also tell him you had been given R50 after the money was counted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you do this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Because I was forced to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who by?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Even before I made this statement the police threatened me that I should tell the Magistrate that I was tortured.  So things like that I would not say if I was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, you said even before you made this statement: "I was threatened by the police that I should tell the Magistrate I was tortured", is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you mean that you were threatened by the police if you told the Magistrate you were tortured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you taken to the Magistrate to make a statement to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did he ask you if you were making it freely and voluntarily?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> It was myself who gave that statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was this, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> It was on the 27th of October if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did he record the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I don't understand your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he write it down, record it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Weren't you asked to sign it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You mean you were taken to the Chief Magistrate to make a statement, you can't say if he wrote it down and you weren't asked to sign it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, they took me to the Magistrate.  It is true that I was taken to the Magistrate, that is the police.  Where I remember that he said to me to sign is where he made mistakes what I was telling him about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you say he made you(?) to sign it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was this statement referred to at your trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is your trial in the Supreme Court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Can I just clarify something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> The contents of the statement, what you told the Magistrate, was it something that had happened, was it something that you knew or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, it was the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> So the aspect about the R9 000 and the R50, was that the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, it was not truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Then I don't understand because you have just told us that what you told the Magistrate was the truth, how do you explain the discrepancy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> To make an example, as I was able to help those people who took part in that operation, I was able to hide their guns, those are the kinds of elements I put in the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> ...[inaudible] R50?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I said that because I've already told the police.  I knew that it would give me a problem if I don't include that in my statement whilst I did tell the police about the R9 000 and the R50.  That is why I included that in that statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And so when you told the police about the R9 000 was it the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, it was not the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Why did you tell them that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I wanted them to release me because maybe I would be killed because of that so I wanted to satisfy them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did they tell you to tell the Magistrate about the R9 000 or did you tell them about the R9 000 because you wanted to get them off your back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I told them about the R9 000 because I wanted them to leave me alone.  So to the Magistrate I saw that it was risky that I should leave that element in the statement I did before the Magistrate because those are the people who would handle the docket and they would ask my why I didn't tell the Magistrate about the R9 000 whilst I did tell them about the R9 000.  So I was protecting myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just ask you, on what basis did you believe that if you would tell the police a lie that  you received R9 000 plus R50, that they would suddenly leave you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Because I heard from the news the following day that they talked about the money that was involved there and I thought that by so saying I will make them satisfied about the investigations they were doing in this regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did they ask you where the R9 000 was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, they did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You earlier said when you were asked: "How did you learn of the attack"?, you said: "By rumour and by the police in the streets and the township", now you tell us you also heard it on the news.  Where did you hear it on the news?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> At home we have a radio, so we listened to the news on a daily basis and so I listened to the radio when they broadcast the news.  So I learnt that from the radio, and then about the disappearance of the money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What did you hear on the news?  What did they say about the money on the news?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> They said a certain amount of money disappeared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did they say how much?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I don't remember as to whether they said the amount but they said there is the disappearance of money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So why did you choose R9 000 as a figure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> It just came from my head so that they should be satisfied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And this was four months after the incident, after your arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> By then, when you were arrested and before you made this statement to the police, did you have any contact with your then co-accused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So when the police took you in you didn't know whether any of your co-accused had been apprehended?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I knew because we used to go to Low Court whilst the first accused was prosecuted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you speak to him then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, I did not know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What do you mean you did not know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> It was for the first time I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who is the first accused that you're talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is Stanley Tshoane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a>	Mr Mbandazayo, may I just ask you to, in re-examination, canvass the issue of the signature.  We may be in the position here where we don't have a valid application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a>	Mr Mazete, just on the point which has been raised by the Committee, let me start by - you have been asked regarding the application which is in front of you, the application which was submitted to the Truth Commission, and you indicated to the Committee that it was not filled by yourself, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now, what I want to know from you, you have been asked by the Committee about the signature, whether after the application was filled and you have been assisted by whoever assisted you during the filling of the application form, were you asked to append your signature at the end of the application form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Can you please repeat your question, I don't understand your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> After you have completed the application form with the person who was assisting you in filling it, you have already told the Committee that you were asked and this person was filling the application form on your behalf, now I'm asking were you made to sign at the end after he has completed filling the application form on your behalf?  Were you asked to sign the application form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, in the application that I filled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Did you sign the application that you filled?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now you were asked by the Committee - in fact let me ask you this way, is the application which is in front of you they application that you filled when you were assisted by those persons who came to the Grootvlei Prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Can you indicate where did you sign the application form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I signed on that space where it is written: "Deponent".</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> But you've told us that the signature there is not yours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I would like to ask for pardon before this Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Because this application, I see this application is printed.  When I was filling this application it was not printed and I used a blue pen but now I see a black pen.  That is why I was confused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In what language did you fill it out?  This may be the problem</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I was using Sotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now then this may be explaining it.  We can check on our records whether we have the original and that simply a translated version has been put before us.  But even that would be difficult to understand because the signature is affixed here or what pretends to be a signature in a different pen, a different writing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But that is not your signature you've told us, where it says: "Deponent".  You signed your own signature on the form you filled in in ordinary hand-writing, is that what you are telling us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Mazete, let me go back to this question of your signature, are you sure that the application you filled was in your own language, Sesotho?  Was it also written in your own language, Sesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I was not given the form that was written in Sesotho, I was only speaking Sesotho and the person who was filling the form was busy writing as I was speaking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was the form written in English?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In hand-writing, not in print?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> It was printed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it this form or another form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> It means it is the same form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But how did you come not to sign it, how did you sign another form</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Like I have already explained to this Committee, the form that I filled, they person asked me to sign that form after he has filled the form.  So I don't know afterwards what happened to that form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Are you saying it's not this form before you, the one that you have there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I do agree that it is the same form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you've told us repeatedly it's not the one you signed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I don't know whether the person who filled this form wanted to change it or I don't know whether this is the same form that I filled or not but they look similar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But the signature you have told us repeatedly is not your signature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I can fill the form and put the signature and then take that form and make photocopies of it.  My signature will definitely appear on that photocopied document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is the signature on this form a photocopy of your signature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you sign this piece of paper please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, we will undertake in the meantime to see if we can find any other applications in our office in Cape Town, that may be related to this applicant and which may probably be in Sesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Mr Chairperson, can I ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm marking this Exhibit D.  ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a>	Just on that aspect I'm going to your affidavit.  Just look at your affidavit Mr Mazete - let me ask you this way before you look at your affidavit, is that what you have done when you have been requested by the Chairman to put down your signature, is that your signature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that is my signature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now Mr Mazete, I want you to look at the affidavit which is before the Committee and which I started using before we started these proceedings regarding this matter and look at the paragraph 7, below paragraph 7 where it says: "Deponent".</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, I do see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Is that your signature which is there at the bottom of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It appears to be very similar to the signature he has just signed.  The M is the same with a loop in the middle, the g is similar.  ...[inaudible] very unlike the signature on the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairperson, I've been placed in the possession of the warning statement of the applicant which was signed in 1993.  It is his original hand-writing, original document where he signed three times, and it will help you in any way I would like to show it to you and hand it in to you.  I would like to beg leave to just hand it in Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> If the Committee can bear with me, I just want to go to the applicant and check the papers in front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, if I can take another opportunity?  Mr Chairman, I just want to place on record that I was also informed that the accused did actually complete a Section 217 statement which was handed in as an informal(?) confession in the Supreme Court on which he was convicted and found guilty.  Unfortunately there is no copies of those documents in existence anymore and the original is part and parcel of the exhibit list which was handed in in the Supreme Court.  So in actual fact the Section 217 statement was ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What has happened to the exhibits?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairperson, as I understand it was handed in in the Supreme Court.  The investigating officer is here.  We're trying to establish what happened to that exhibit list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] Exhibit V.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a>	Have you got any further questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> None Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MBANDAZAYO</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There are certain matters I would like to clarify with you please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a>	Mr Mazete, you said that you kept the weapons and then you gave them to Mr Mohape for safekeeping.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you have anything to do with the weapons after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see them again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you have anything to do with any other weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were accused number 3 weren't you, at the trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now evidence was led at the trial that on the 22nd of October you took Major Hugo to a sink structure and dug up three R4 rifles, eight magazines and 197 bullets, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What weapons were these?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> If they were the same weapons that we hid there then they were R4's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What weapons did you hide there?  I asked you if you saw any other weapons, you said: "No", now you say you hid weapons there, what weapons did you hide there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is the same weapons that Bhani asked me to go and hide them for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who asked you to go and hide them for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is Mangalisekile Bhani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you told us you gave them to Mohape and never saw them again.  You told me that, you confirmed it again a few minutes ago, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that happened after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> After what?  You told us you were given the weapons to keep and you kept them till people came to stay and you then gave them to Mohape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that was the last you saw of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I saw them again when we went there with the police to dig them up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But when were they buried there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> We hid them in August.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you gave them to Mohape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> After you gave them to Mohape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you tell me that you never saw them again after you gave them to Mohape?  Had you forgotten that there was this evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That time when we were digging them up they were just a parcel, a wrapped parcel so I was not quite sure whether they were the same weapons that were used or we hid there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You told us nothing whatsoever about hiding weapons, you told us on more than one occasion that you gave them to Mohape and when I've just asked you you said that you never saw them again.  Now, because I've questioned you about the evidence at your trial, you say, oh yes, after you gave them to Mohape you went along and buried them.  Why are you lying to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> I'm am not telling a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said you never saw them again after you gave them to Mohape, now you say that is not true, you went and buried them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> Like I've already explained in court, the time when we went with the police it was just a wrapped parcel but I did not see them with my eyes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that your explanation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAZETE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And there's one other matter which I don't know if counsel can help me with, as to what Exhibit D was at the trial.  I've glanced through the Judgment but I haven't been able to find it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a>	It may be that we will have to re-call this applicant tomorrow to clarify that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, I've endeavoured now to get hold of the register of the Supreme Court so that we can at least get a list of the exhibits and probably all the exhibits itself if needed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If we can have that by tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> As you please Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And if you can get this statement that was handed in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, apparently that was also an exhibit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] referred to in the Judgment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a>	Right, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a>Thank you.</p>
