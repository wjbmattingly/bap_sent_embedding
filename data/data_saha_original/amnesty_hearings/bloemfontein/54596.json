            "They were members of the PAC until they were transferred to the task force.  It was one of the units that advocated the struggle of the Africans against oppression that we lived under from these people that are referred to as Whites.  In that way being members of the PAC also being a person responsible and I identify people who were to advocate the armed struggle then I picked them out as important people these honourable men and Africans who came here for amnesty.  They did undergo a crash course.  The important thing here is that APLA as any other organisation has got a chain of commands and task force was a unit outside APLA.  However, it was part of PAC to advocate the armed struggle.\n\tI can explain this manner about the task force.  It had specific duties to carry out, however, the commander of this force has the authority to designate duties for them to carry out which were in the name of the organisation itself.  The duties of task force was to defend and/or protect the organisation against I can say infiltration or attacks from other organisations or vigilantes who were against the organisation.  As I have said its commander has got the \nBLOEMFONTEIN HEARING\tAMNESTY/FREE STATE\nMR MTHEMBU\t144\tO KHOTLE\nauthority to designate duties except these that I have just explained.  For example duties to go and attack or offensive tasks to carry out.  The commander has got such authority and as we have observed as from the eighties the year was referred to as the year of intensification or revolution, the time of Uncle Zefanye Matupeng.  In 1990 this year was referred to as the year People's Offensive.  We established this that we refer to as the Great Storm.  Great Storm was established because of the people's offensive against oppression, exploitation and social depression.\n\tThat's what happened, it's a fact.  The late comrade John Showa, who was one of the seniors in APLA and who was responsible for the task force operations being a person that I am well known to because I was a member of APLA.  He requested me to identify people who can be important to take our struggle forward.  Our armed struggle forward.  I did that job.  I can tell this Commission that these Africans who are here explaining their deeds are not the only ones that I have identified and let them meet seniors within APLA to come and undergo this crash course so that we take our struggle forward.  There are some of them who might appear before you.  Our struggle was not dependent on colour, it was a struggle against the oppressors, against the attackers of Africans, briefly I could refer to them as Whites, they were part of this operation.  When the Africans received this crash course I was present even though I was not charged with the duties of the task force I was charged with the duties of APLA.  However it was my duty because APLA was not what I could refer to as an organ that can take the struggle forward alone.  The task force and the community was part of the struggle and we observed that they are what \nBLOEMFONTEIN HEARING\tAMNESTY/FREE STATE\nMR MTHEMBU\t145\tO KHOTLE\nwe refer to as mass protest and demonstrations.  There are political actions that can be taken up by the community.  On the other hand APLA involved arms struggle which we can refer to as military operation. Task force, even though it didn't have the training that APLA members received did have this privilege of taking forward the struggle because it's history and no one would say it doesn't know that Africans were oppressed at that time.  So these Africans were trained because every member of the crash course who would be recruited will be asked questions and we would want to see whether this African does he have understanding of the country's political situation.  If we are satisfied that they do have the understanding, great understanding of politics within the country it is only then that we can treat them as fit and proper people to take participation in the task force and undergo a crash course.  \n\tIt has two parts, ideological and political, then follows the military part of it, weapon handling, battle formations and such other things.   Due to the limited time and place where at that time we were not able to render, especially at the locations, proper training to these members because the enemy was all over looking for us.  They were given important facts, those that were necessary to take the struggle forward.",

            "As I've explained the one who was responsible for the task force was the late comrade Showa.  He is the one who gave out the order that the farmers be attacked.  Let me explain briefly around that point.  The farmers, we must understand they are part or they form part or they were BLOEMFONTEIN HEARING\tAMNESTY/FREE STATE\nMR MTHEMBU\t146\tO KHOTLE\npart of the oppressors at that time because the farmers you could actually define them they are twofold.  They can be police reservists or army reservists.  They are the people who were always ready for call-ups either in the army or in the police force, they were always alert to come and do national service. That is a known fact, it's not a secret.  And Mr Fourie who was murdered or rather attacked, I don't think he was attacked because he was Mr Fourie or he did something to somebody, he was attacked because he formed part of oppression towards the Africans.  To testify on this I want to bring to the attention of the Commission that in most cases you will find that the farmers have a lot of artilleries or firearms and you would ask yourselves if they are referred to as soft targets or civilians, what about these firearms that you find in their houses, because you cannot have firearms that you cannot use in your house.  \n\tSo I want to explain that Mr Fourie was attacked as he formed part of the oppression.  He could be an army reservist or police reservist.  You must also recall that in what ever country where there is a political struggle the one who is in power if the country's economy is not stable would not be able to govern for a long time.  So the farmers by forming agricultural production did a lot of participation to support the government of oppression with everything they can so that it goes forward and oppresses the Africans because they have been oppressed for more than 300 years and the National Party you would observe that from 1948 up till now it is because of their agricultural unions that supported it and some of them which are foreign to this country.",

When he grabs the ball being known that he is the person who can do tricks with the ball maybe he can refer to as Disco, which can be related to the manner in which he plays soccer.  Here we are referring to one settler one bullet slogan because originally as we look back as the President, as the former President Comrade Clarence Makwetu explained that the source, the main cause of this struggle is that when you are engaged in a fight there is no way you can say you feel sympathy for this enemy.  One settler one bullet slogan, it is a slogan and a slogan goes along with time, you must understand that.  It is not a policy or a principle of PAC. It  was a slogan because the Africans were engaged in an armed struggle and we must recall that it is not the Africans who decided to engage in an armed struggle, it was the government of the oppressors who forced the Africans to engage in an armed struggle.  This is what happened on the 21 March 1960 where the Boers government banned our organisations, ANC and PAC and then the organisations were forced into exile.  This is where our organisations asked themselves if now we are to fight for our freedom in peace or - then these Boers shoot us, shoot at us then we must retaliate in the same manner.  It is not for us to be blamed that there was MK or APLA or an armed\nBLOEMFONTEIN HEARING\tAMNESTY/FREE STATE\nMR MTHEMBU\t150\tO KHOTLE\nstruggle.  It is their problem.

A gold wrist watch with the deceased's name engraved on the back of it and similar articles.  They were found all over the place, in the possession of a number of people.  They have all been identified by Mrs May as belonging to herself or the deceased.  In these circumstances it seems to me we should firstly make the documents available to you so you can read them, if necessary take instructions and furthermore it would perhaps be desirable to obtain a copy of the judgment at the trial which may deal with all these points.  If not we should call these two people.\n\tIn any event I feel Mrs May should be informed that this application is proceeding.  At the time that she made this affidavit she gave an address there.  Those people may well be able to find her, and it seems to me we should let the matter stand down for the moment, but it certainly will not be concluded today, depending on the attitude adopted by your clients.  They have now committed themselves to one version.  \n\tIt also appears, I may be have misread the affidavit that some of the coins were sold and a cheque for R1 200 was found in the possession of, I think, Mr Leeuw.
