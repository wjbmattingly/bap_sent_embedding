I do not, however, wish to waste unnecessary time, and it seems to me, subject to the agreement of the members of my Committee, that we should hear the application on the basis that we do not accept that there is a valid application before us, that there is an onus on the applicant to obtain further information as to whether an application was in fact ever lodged, and to supply us with such information.  If that is done, we will then treat the application as a valid application and have regard to the evidence we have heard.

And it is also, I think, necessary to put a time limit on this, that this must be done within one month of today.
