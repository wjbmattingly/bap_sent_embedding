            "Chairperson, I will begin to read the affidavit.  The affidavit reads thus\n\"I, Samson Zongizile Tuis, c/o Groenpunt Correctional Services, Registration 93143109, do hereby state under oath and say\n\t\tI am the applicant in this matter.  I wish to state further to my application and in answer to a request for further particulars as follows:\n\t\tThe people I killed were two elderly white females, whose names I now forget.  They were living in a farm in Brandfort, outside town, near a black man's township.  The person who identified and informed us that the victims were legitimate targets for operation was Commander Dlogodlo.  Commander Dlogodlo did not furnish us with these correct names, this name was just a code name or nickname for the organisation.  I did not know his physical address.  The person that I hope should know him is Lebohang ...(indistinct) of 6883, Extension 8,  Gamaneng, Bloemfontein.  I also hope that William, Willie Nkosana of 11269 Lebona Street, Mozoneng, Klumande Township, Bloemfontein, knows him.  He's now a soldier in Pretoria, but the exact address of employment is unknown to me.  \n\t\tThe persons who were with me during the operation other than Dlogodlo who gave orders were Petros Peter Peleo who is in Groenpunt Correctional Services and Mulduran Mologwai, alias Thebogo, who is also in Groenpunt prison.  According to them they did apply for amnesty but they have not heard anything up to now.  \n\t\tThe operation was planned firstly during the 10th of January, whilst I was still serving two years sentence in Ramkraal prison in Bloemfontein.  Dlogodlo came as a visitor and found me working outside at the white's homes.  When he came to me, I was going to be released on the 21st January 1993.  He ordered me not to go anywhere on the 3rd of January 1993 after my release.  On the 3rd of February, after my release.\n\t\tOn the 3rd of February 1993, Dlogodlo came with Tabiso Makwala, Pitso Peleo and Macdonald Mologwai.  They arrived, driving in a private car.  They took me to Bloemfontein, near the ...(indistinct) bar.  We sat in the car outside on a parking.  It is where Dlogodlo gave us instructions to kill the whites in Free State, take the money if it is enough, bring guns and vehicles.  It was here that the operation was decided upon and Pitso also identified it as a farm he had knowledge about.\n\t   After these discussions, we returned to Bloemfontein.  I, Pitso and Macdonald proceeded to\tthis farm.  We left about 7 o'clock in the evening, each armed with a Rambo knife, dagger type.  We arrived at the farm about 11 in the evening.  We jumped over the fence and proceeded to the mielie plantation towards the house.  Pitso produced a handgun and I then realised that he had a firearm.  He led us until we found an open window through which we entered the house.  We searched through the rooms but did not find anyone.  On the extreme right we saw light and went to peep.  We saw a white woman in bed reading her Bible.  We entered, grabbed her, tied her hands, demanded for money.  She denied any money being in the house.  Pitso stabbed on her and instructed us to search in further rooms and kill whoever we find.  He suggested that the first female will produce the money.  He also produced a firearm for her as a threat.  We searched another room and found her mother.  We attacked and killed her.  After killing her, we brought her to her daughter so that she could see that we have killed her.  This victim cried and started to hand a firearm by telling us where we could find it.  The firearm was a revolver with 6 bullets.  She also pointed to a bank bag with some silver coins.  She also handed R30 and car keys.  She was also killed by stabbing her several times.  The old lady was also stabbed several times.  We dragged the old lady back into her room and let her down.  We took the items with us, got into an Isuzu van and I drove it away.  We left Pitso on the way, gave some share and I drove on with Macdonald.  \n\t\tI was arrested on the 18th of February with Thebogo.  Pitso was arrested subsequently.  The vehicle was left near a flat at Tempi, where Dlogodlo had instructed us to leave it.  I heard over the news on the 4th of February that the vehicle had been recovered.   We used the money that we got from the victim.  \n\t\tWhen I heard about this, I alerted Pitso who also informed me that he had heard about it.  He advised me to destroy a tape cassette that I had taken from the vehicle.  I did destroy it.  That is all I can say.  I know and I understand the contents of this statement.  I have no objection to taking the prescribed oath.  I consider the prescribed oath to be binding on my conscience.\"\nNow Mr Tuis, I've read your statement for the record for the Commission.  Now I would like - do you want to add anything to this statement?",

I closed the room and I went to the public phones to inform Pitso - to call Pitso and I told him:  \"Pitso, the police are busy with the investigations\".  He asked me:  \"Listen, the tape that was in the car, did you leave it behind or did you take it?\"  I told him I took it, it is the same tape that informed me and he said to me:  \"Destroy it please\" and I destroyed it.",

He was living together with his wife and his child, it was easy for me to go and revenge myself against him, but you see, it was because of the decision that the woman was bad luck.

I chose Samson and Macdonald because there were the Africans I know and they were with me in the training of the Task Force and I told him that it was Samson and Thebogo.  \n\tHe asked me to introduce him to them and I told him the other one was in prison and the other one was outside.  So we left with him, together with Tabiso Makwala and we went to Macdonald Thebogo.  I showed him Thebogo.  He told Thebogo that he wanted to meet us on the 3rd of February.  He left to where Tuis was working and we met with Tuis and he asked when Tuis was going to be released.  Tuis informed him.  He told Tuis that he wanted to meet us, the three of us on the 3rd.  \n\tIt happened then that Tuis was released from prison on the 3rd.  He arrived,  Mr Makwala, he was together with Mr Dlogodlo.  We went to Thebogo's place.  We found him and we took him and we left for Samson's place.  When we arrived he was there and he got into the car and we all left for town.  \n\tWe stopped at a place called Nineteen Ten, that's where Dlogodlo informed us that there's work that he wanted to give us and this was the attacking of farmers and he said he wanted money and firearms and we should destroy.

On me entering the room, I produced a firearm, I pointed her, she was lying on top of the bed and I searched the bed and a firearm fell from underneath the mattress.  I searched and there was nothing.  I left - I left her - I told her to sit on the bed and I sat on the dressing table and whilst sitting on the dressing table, waiting for Samson and Macdonald, Samson came in and he told me:  \"We have found another one and we have tied her up already\" and I said to him:  \"Why did you leave her?  Kill her and this one will tell us everything\".  Samson went back into that other room.  This woman told me that they did not have money and the money that she had was all in the bank.  She pointed at the wardrobe.  She said:  \"Open that door and there is a bank bag inside there but it only contains silver and a purse\".  I opened the wardrobe and I discovered that bank bag and I took it out.  I put it on the floor.\n\tWhen I was searching further, I heard someone knocking the door and it was this woman knocking the bedroom door and she was naked and she told me, she said:  \"Man, don't kill me, I will give you whatever you want\".  I said to her:  \"Dress, why do you undress?\" and I don't know what happened, I just got blank and she was walking at a distance from that table and I don't know what happened thereafter.  She was close to me and she caressed me.  While I was a bit drowsy, she hit me with a knew on the stomach and I nearly fell and she wanted to grab the firearm and I managed though to quickly grab the gun and pointed it at her and I told her to dress.  That she was raped, no, she was not.  I am still asking myself how it came about that my blood got into her, but I'm sorry, please I left a few words, I did not include them, allow me.  As she was caressing me, she pulled down my pants up to the knees and I think, as she was caressing me, we might have touched each other and that's how my blood got to her, but that I raped her, that is not true.
