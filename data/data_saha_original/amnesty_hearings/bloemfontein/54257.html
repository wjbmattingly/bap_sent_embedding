<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Is it also correct that you were involved in the farm attack in the Lady Grey farm area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Can you tell the Committee about this farm attack in Lady Grey?  Where exactly in Lady Grey did this take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> Even though I don't know that area well, the Lady Grey area, but the attack happened near Umkopane area.  It was myself, Kleintjie, and Scorpion that were involved.  We were going to attack a farm, when we got there, there was nobody and we only used the molotovs.  We burned that farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Kulman, were there any vehicles on this farm when you did this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> No, there were no vehicles in that farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now, Chairperson the name Kleintjie is Tabiso James Makwala, Chairperson, who's deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> He mentioned a third name, Scorpion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Chairperson, I've just - the name Scorpion Chairperson I've just misplaced, but the problem I have is that it was used by about five people so we did not know who actually was involved with them, but I had five names, but I've just misplaced those five names, I don't know who actually was with them in this attack, but it was used by five people, the name Scorpion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So Makwala would be the application that appears on page 49?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now can you tell the Committee who came up with the idea that this farm should be attacked and who gave this order and who made the reconnaissance of the area as you indicated that you are not well-versed with that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> The person who gave me the order was Ace who was the original Commander in Sterkspruit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Who made the reconnaissance of the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> It was Kleintjie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you know where Kleintjie originally lived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> I did not know but I heard that he was from Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because I've just flipped into my bundle here, I see he says he's from Botshabelo and the place of birth is Thaba N'chu.  You wouldn't dispute that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> No, I wouldn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed Mr Mbandazayo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Now, what was your purpose of going to that farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> It was to attack the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Why you wanted to attack the farm?  What purpose were you attacking the farm?  What was the reason for you to attack the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> The reason was to drive the farmers away from our land.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> And you say your purpose was to attack the farm.  Was your purpose to attack and kill the farmer or what was the real intention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> Killing was also part of our operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> So if the occupants were there, the owners, would they have been killed on that occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Is it correct that you were armed with 7.65 and also a panga on the day in question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> And is it correct that when you arrived at this farm, you checked at the windows and you discovered that there were no people inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> Yes, we did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> And you discovered that this place was under renovation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> And you retreated, but before you did that, you lit the grass and you left the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> Yes, that is correct.  They were also damaging the house, even though some molotovs were not effective.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Chairperson, this is the evidence.  Unfortunately we can't say which was the farm, Chairperson, as the applicant was depending on Tabiso Makwala, the people who were from this area, he's from Port Elizabeth, he did not know the area.  We can't say which farm was it that was actually attacked by them.  We have that problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MBANDAZAYO</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So, Mr Mbandazayo, because I see he's applying for several things and I think I've got two applications, but this application just relates to that farm which was attacked, where you cannot say with precision the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Yes, Chairperson, the other application, the only one which is not yet heard now, is the Kei Mouth one.  The Ficksburg one we have already had regarding to him and the other ones, Donny Meyer, Mike Meyer incident, have already been heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> This farm is in the Lady Grey area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Yes, Chairperson, this one is in Lady Grey area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, I don't know if that is helpful to you Mr Coetzer, but I'll leave it in your hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZER:</span> I thank you Chairperson and Members of the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR COETZER:</span> Mr Kulman, did you set alight a barn on the farm in the Lady Grey area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> Can you please repeat your question Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZER:</span> The farm that you set alight in the Lady Grey area, was there a barn in which vehicles were parked, or some form of a shed or garage in which vehicles were parked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> I did not see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZER:</span> Very well.  You stated that you threw the so-called molotovs in the grass.  Was this in the veld or was it in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It would appear the applicant has problems with the device.  I see him just pointing to the device.  Could we just hold on for a second Mr Coetzer, let them take care of the device.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZER:</span> As it pleases the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see him nodding his head, Mr Coetzer, but I would ask you to repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZER:</span> I thank the Honourable Committee.  Mr Kulman, you made mention that you tossed the so-called molotovs in the grass, was this in the pastures or was it at the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> Some of those, we threw them in the house and I think we threw others in the barn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> You say you threw some in the barn, so I thought you said you don't know whether there was a barn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Chairperson, I think the interpretation is that he threw it in the grazing land. I think that's the interpretation that is coming out.  Correct ...(indistinct) it's a grazing land.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are saying that's the interpretation that should come out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Yes, Chairperson.  Do you follow that Mr Coetzer, that there was just a mistake in the translation?  That it was not the barn as we had it, I heard the barn as well.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZER:</span> Indeed Chairperson.  I did not want it to be in the barn at this stage.  So what was the purpose with tossing the molotovs into the pastures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> It was to sabotage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZER:</span> Was the intention to burn animals to death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> If there were animals there, we would have burned them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZER:</span> Very well.  Honourable Members of the Committee with the exception of pointing it out to you that some of the cattle of my clients were also killed during this incident, I have nothing further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR COETZER</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What was the number?  How many were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZER:</span> If the Honourable Members of the Committee would grant me a moment, it is all in the report, I will just consult it briefly.  The number of animals is not mentioned but the extent of the damage is fixed at approximately R28 000, that is on page 55 of the documents in paragraph 3.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Kulman, did you read about the damage caused by your attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR KULMAN:</span> I did not read it, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Mr Coetzer.  Ms Mtanga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> I have no questions Chairperson, thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> No questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Obviously you don't have any re-examination Mr Mbandazayo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> None, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MBANDAZAYO</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that your case in respect of Mr Kulman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> For formality - no, no, finish with the instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZER:</span> Chairperson, Members of the Committee, I would listen to you first and then take instructions.  These are not instructions that I want to obtain, but  a question that I would like to put to my clients.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  I wanted to ask you that, are you going to lead evidence again, or we assume the position we had before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZER:</span> Chairperson and Honourable Members of the Committee, this is the same as in case number one with regard to the first applicant, that we will abide by the same position.  In other words, if he was involved in any deeds, there is forgiveness and no feelings of malice.  The Myburgs have come here today with a clear state of mind, they are not here out of vengeance, but they are here in the name of reconciliation.  As it pleases you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you very much Mr Coetzer.  The sentiment expressed, before I express them again, thank you.  Ms Mtanga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Chairperson, I have no questions but if the Committee may allow me, I just want to bring to the attention of the Committee that on page 55 of the bundle, where Mr Hans Myburg's statement is, paragraph 2, where it starts with:  "On the 26th of May 1992..." I would just like the Committee to link that incident to Gqomfa and Steven Dolo, that's the farm they attacked and the name of the farm was called Fairview.  I'm sorry Chairperson, the first farm in Wilgerspruit and it appears that the farm was attacked twice, the second time it was in May of the same year and that appears in paragraph 3 and this is in respect of the application by Mr ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> It was a neighbouring farm, the neighbouring farm was ...(indistinct - mike not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Chairperson. according to my Learned Friend it was one farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE DE JAGER:</span> It might have been farmed as a unit but it's a separate ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Operating under the same name, that's what they're saying.  Both attacks took place at the Fairview farm Mr Chairperson and this second attack is in respect of the application of Mr Kulman and the two other persons, Makwala and Scorpion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see that their farm was actually attacked but the fire spread over to the neighbours, thank you.  Mr Kulman, thank you very much, you are excused.</p>
