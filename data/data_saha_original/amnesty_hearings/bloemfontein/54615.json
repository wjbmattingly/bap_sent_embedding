I did not say I went to collect the file and you are quite correct, Mr Commissioner, because, clearly, on the hypothesis which you just put to me, if the man went into the room and he saw there are two files, there could be one or two scenarios.\n\tOne is I took the file, I collected it, which he now says he did not say and, obviously, that he would have read it.  The next scenario would be I saw the files, I was told it was the file of Musi and China and that is the end of the matter.  So, the first scenario has now fallen away.  I am now back on the second scenario, Mr Chairman, in which he says I saw the files on the table and I am just going to ask him one question.

You would then go and arrest people.  It is different.  They did not go and collect Musi, they went to kill Musi and I do not know what, why Mr Visser proceeds like this while, at the end of the day, he is going to have problems with his style of cross-examination, because eventually there will not be any weight to be put to it.
