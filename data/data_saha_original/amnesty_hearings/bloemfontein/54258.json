The regarded the South African Defence Force, the South African Police and reservists, farmers and the white homes as bastions and minions of the regime, so hence they were regarded as targets, especially the farmers.  They regarded them that they belonged to Commando structures, over and above the fact that they occupied the farms which they had to drive them away from, so as to widen their territorial operational base which was aimed at eventually consolidating the liberated and repossessed land.  So it was based on that, their policy, the attack on farms, that they regarded them, you know they belonged to commando structures and also they occupied the vast land which in terms of the PAC policy that their policy was based on the land issue, that the land belongs to the African people, so the farmers were occupying those particular land and the vast majority of the land was in the hands of the farmers, so the policy was to drive away the farmers from those lands, so they have to be attacked and also to cripple the economy, as the country's economy was based on the farmers, so what they did was indeed in line with the PAC policy.

The recommendation that has appeared in this document so far is that everybody will receive on the same level, there will not be reparations because for example a person lost an arm and another person is now paraplegic, it will be paid out on the same basis, an amount that the Government will decide on.  It will depend on how many people will apply for reparation and how much money is available.  If amnesty is granted in this case and if we find that it is a political deed, in that case we will then say that you will be classified as victims and then you will also have the right to make  a claim for the same reparation of the other victims in other cases.

We arrived there and used molotovs.  After that - there was no resistance which we encountered during that operation.  We retreated back to Transkei.  We burned the graze land.  After that we crossed to Transkei.  I'm not sure of the estimated damage, what I know is that the veld was burned.

Then he was briefed.  Then the following day it was late when he returned, but I should be present so that I should lead the attack.  All in all we were six and we split into two groups.  In my group it was Roger who was involved in the reconnaissance, therefore I was led by him because of his observations during the reconnaissance.  Therefore we split into - the second group involved Kleintjie, who was also involved in the reconnaissance.  Therefore we executed the operation.  The reason for the attack was that firstly it was an area which was used by whites and it is of benefit to the economy of the country because economically the white people there were helping to make the economy stable or grow and they also benefitted individually from that economy.  Therefore again, the - secondly the far workers - the farmers were members of the Commando structures and some of them were reservists, therefore we wanted to increase the liberated zones so that when we progress as liberation army, we'll be able to use those places as a springboard for further attacks.

How many were you and how were you armed?\nMR KHOTLE\nIn this second operation we were five, it was myself, Scorpion Totina is one person, the third person was King, the fourth one was Roger, the fifth person was Kleintjie.  The reconnaissance for that attack was done by me.  There was a problem.  There was a house, supposed to be occupied by the owner of the farm and there were also houses supposed to be  occupied by the employees and there was also a place where the cows were fed.  Now that was the - there was a problem.  We noticed that either way, the owners of the farm do not live there.  They took Africans and they made them live in that house that was supposed to be occupied by them.   As a result we decided, yes, even if it was occupied by an African, but it qualified to be the target.  This does not mean Africans were automatically targets because they were in that house, we thought they were being used as shields and we had to minimise so that at the end the operation is carried, but there are no injuries, that is referring to the farm workers, so that not one of them gets injured.\n\t\tI was armed with a 7.65.  We had a stun gun as well and we had Molotovs and we had grenades that were not functioning well, the mechanism was not working well, but we took them anyway, so that at the time of throwing the molotovs, the information we do not have is correct, we'd throw them in the fire and they will explode through the help of the fire.   \n\t\tSo we left then for the farm and on our arrival, that is when we approached, many dogs approached us.  We advanced towards them and they shied away to another room, where we threw the molotovs and people screamed inside, they cried.  Now that was the impression, the impression that I got out of that was that the people who were crying were the farm workers.  Now I concluded that they were being used as shields, the owners of the house were not in the house, they might have been living in town.  \tNow during the course of throwing these molotovs, I took out another instruction.  I said the throwing of molotovs should be stopped, only to find that they had been thrown already and then we retreated.  Kenny, who has since died, had the grenades and the sabotaged hand grenades.  The initial instruction was not to throw the grenade in case it is noticed that the occupiers of the house are Africans, but during this whole incident, it happened that he dropped the grenade.  \n\t\tWe thereafter retreated and then we burned the veld and we went back to the Transkei.  I wanted to know, at a certain point, who was left where and whether there were any casualties and that is where I learned that Kenny dropped that sabotaged hand grenade and that was the end of the operation.",

That is why then I'm saying it was one way for them to learn, but then we had to avoid a lesson - we had to teach a lesson but we had to avoid some situations.

Mr Mbandazayo, we do reserve this one.  You would be informed in due course just to be on the safe side.\n\tThis brings us to the conclusion of the hearings here.  Firstly I want to thank the members of Correctional Services.  They gave us an outstanding service.  I think it's the first that I had such prompt attendance of inmates brought by the Department of Correctional Services.  This is highly appreciated.  Should we call upon you again to do the same, please know that your duties are appreciated by this Committee and you are making our job easier.  I want to thank the Church for having made this wonderful venue available to us to conduct these hearings.  We are very grateful to the church and the personnel they have made available and I must say for also spoiling us with the food we have had.  I think I have picked up a few kilogrammes which I will have problems in shedding.  I want to thank you Mr Mbandazayo.  You had the longest serving in these hearings.  Thank you for your assistance.  Ms Mtanga, thank you for the wonderful work you have done, it was so easy to follow.  Thank you very much and we say, you keep it up and that goes to show that we have people who care in the Amnesty Committee.\n\tYou know there are people you seldom see who are caged in boxes on my left.  They do a wonderful job.  You could remember at some time I would say to the applicants:  \"Please slow down because they've got to catch up with you\" and we seldom thank them.  I want to say thank you very much.  And to everybody who has shown interest in these hearings, we thank you very much, your attendance is highly appreciated.\n\tThis hearing is adjourned but that does not say you would not have something to eat.  Please have it even though you'll pick up kilos like me.  Charmaine I'm always with you and I'm always saying privately thank you, but let me say it in public.  Thank you very much for your assistance to us.  We're adjourned.",
