It was attested to on the 11th of March 1997. We understand that it was thereafter (indistinct - not speaking into microphone) to the investigative unit with the request that he forward it to Cape Town, and that that was done.

Where the question is \"home language\", the answer is SAP Internal Security.   I don't know if they have some private language, but he says at the bottom that he is going to tell - he is not going to tell the Commission about what happened to him, but he is going to tell the Commission about what happened to someone else, as I understand the circling.  There is then a document described as a brief description of the violation of human rights.  That is signed by him on the 24th of March, as I understand it, that was the statement he made to the TRC, with a view to his appearing at a public hearing.\n\tAnnexed thereto is a further document, headed Annexure B, the reasons for this application the following.  \nI have no idea where that Annexure B comes from or what the relevance of it is, and would be obliged if we could be told.",

It may very well be that the applicant in fact, when he submitted Annexure B, in fact he intended to apply for amnesty in respect of those particular acts.  But then the next question would be, now how has he applied in a way that will comply with the prescribed requirements.  And that is a different issue which can be approached differently. For example, we may hear argument as to whether the initial application form could be amended et cetera, et cetera.  But we need to understand the exact basis or the exact understanding that existed as the basis on which this Annexure B was submitted.

May I however, preface what we are going to say now by saying that it certainly isn't our objective to stand in the way of anybody who wants to ask for amnesty, where he is obviously entitled to it, but what has occurred here, Mr Chairman, is that at the last hearing, which was, I think the 23rd, 24th of March, when we were in Bloemfontein, we were presented with the hand-written statement which became handed in as Exhibit P28, the one that you have been referring to now as the statement to the TRC.  At the time we requested Mr Mpshe to explain to us what the status of the document was, which at the time he was apparently not able to do.  He, however, wanted to hand it in, and we had no objection to him doing so, and Mr Chairman, unfortunately again, we haven't got a transcript of the record, but there was something placed on record by Mr Mpshe in regard to Exhibit P28.  Unfortunately, I cannot remember what was said about it, but what I do remember, Mr Chairman, is that we stated our position to be that we don't object to it being handed in, but we question its status in an application for amnesty.\n\tNow Mr Chairman, may I take you to last week.  On Wednesday I was confronted by 13 people in my chambers, who came to consult with me on what was stated in the further document which was referred to as Annexure B.  Apparently that had been forwarded by Mr Mpshe to some of the implicated persons as part of Section 19(4) notifications. When we - that is my attorney and myself, were confronted with Annexure B, my attorney acting on my instructions, telephoned Mr Mpshe and he asked him what the status of Annexure B was.  First of all, I am sorry, Mr Chairman, may I repeat. First of all, we asked Mr Mpshe to please forward us the complete application, so that we could see what was intended to be the application.  We then received the original application form signed on the 8th of November.  We received Exhibit P28 and we had received Annexure B.  My attorney thereupon telephoned Mr Mpshe again.  And he said -he asked him what the status is of Annexure B and what the status is of - I'm sorry, Exhibit P28 and Annexure B.  Mr Mpshe then tells my attorney that he wasn't dealing with the matter, Ms Thabetha was.   Ms Thabetha then spoke to my attorney.  In the course of which my attorney told her that we have serious doubts as to the legality of both Exhibit P28 as well as Annexure B. We intimated that we believed that it was our duty to bring this, draw this to the attention of the Committee at this stage.\n\tNow today Mr Chairman, Justice Ngoepe has stated the position exactly as we attempted to state it to the Commission's officials. Maybe the first point of departure is whether Mr Motsamai intended this to be an application for amnesty.  If we assume that it was, the next question is whether ...  (TAPE FADES - INDISTINCT).\n\t... and then over the page at Section 18, which you have already read today, Mr Chairman, makes it plain that an application for the granting of amnesty must be completed in the prescribed form.  That is the one promulgated by regulation and that is the typical form 1 which we have here before us in all these applications.  Then, Mr Chairman, we read on and we came to Section 20, which is quite explicit, in our submission, Section 20, where it says -\n\"Granting of amnesty and effect thereof, the Committee, after considering  an application for amnesty is satisfied that;\n\t\t\t(a)\tthe application complies with the requirements of the Act.\"\nWe read through the Act, Mr Chairman, in order to attempt to find any jurisdiction on the part of the Committee to condone any non-compliance with the Act, and we could find none.  Again, Mr Chairman, we are not here to stand in the way of Mr Motsamai, but these are the considerations which prompted us to inform Ms Thabetha at the time. We will inform the Committee that there is only application for amnesty before you and that is the murder in Melck Street.  \tHaving said that, Mr Chairman, we have prepared on all the other incidents and we leave it in your discretion, Mr Chairman, as to what you are going to do about it.",

We understand that they are at the present time being faxed up here and that the first page or two have arrived.  In these circumstances it seems impossible to proceed with the matter at the present time. These pages must be made available to the parties and an investigation made as to when they were received, because if that is - if they were sent, as we were told they were, we can stop talking about the Annexure B and everything else.  It appears that a proper application was launched at the proper time, with the necessary annexures, because our attitude has been that we do not insist that everything must be written on the principal page, as long as it is attached to the application in terms of the Act.  And if that was done here, well, then the question we have spent a great deal of time on today debating goes out by the window.  We continue and the parties must obviously be given an opportunity to investigate the incidents which he in fact applied for amnesty originally. And it appears that having regard to the time now, it would be impossible to conclude the matter today and it would be unfair to commence the evidence of a witness when one is going to have to adjourn halfway through his evidence in chief, which means that his legal advisers can't talk to him and months later he has got to remember what he said.\n\tThat appears to us, subject to anything that may be said, that the only answer at the present time is to adjourn to a date to be determined and the matter can then be disposed of.  We say this, because there is a matter set down for hearing tomorrow, this has already been crowded out once, and we feel that this matter certainly not be ready to proceed tomorrow.  It also appears to us, having regard to the new incidents which the applicant now, I think is going to introduce, if they are similar to those in Exhibit B, that the argument in favour of hearing the two applications together, becomes very untenable.  \n\tThere are at the most, I think, two incidents in common and numerous other incidents that were not committed by the same people at the same time and it would be far preferable in those circumstances to hear the applications separately.  We propose accordingly, to adjourn this matter to a date to be arranged.\n\tIt may well be that when we - communication is kept up between the parties that it would be desirable to set it down for hearing before or after the other matter that we have already adjourned, because they are the same legal advisers engaged in both matters, that we could do one and the other one immediately thereafter.  But I do not think it possible to continue, certainly, it is impossible to finish it today and I regret very much that it seems that the delay, the wasted day has been caused by the fact that these three pages were not made available. They are the pages that should have annexed to the letter written to the applicant's legal advisers. They are obviously the pages which one says are these part of your application, if they were lodged with the application it is clearly that is a very proper question to ask.  For some reason there has been some misfiling or something of that nature, I cannot say what, but the papers must be made available to all parties.
