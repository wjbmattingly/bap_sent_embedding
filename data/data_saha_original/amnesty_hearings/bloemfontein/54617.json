The first document is a set of three pocket books of Mr Ngo for the period 1987 to approximately August 1988.\n\tThen we have also located the occurrence book of the Mamelodi barracks.  I think that goes right to the end of 1989.  And then we have also located the if I can call it the record book or the, yes the record book of everybody who was resident at the barracks, indicating that Mr Ngo was resident at the Mamelodi barracks from 5 February 1987.  May I beg leave to hand up copies of simply extracts from these documents, which we've made for the Committee's purposes.\n\tThe documents are voluminous and obviously we couldn't make copies of everything, we just made certain extracts.  Captain Koja has the original documents with him and I will elaborate a little bit more during the evidence in respect of certain of the documents.\n\tMr Chairman, my Attorney has suggested that he be appointed to the Investigating Unit at the TRC.  Mr Chairman, the extracts do not really reflect the amount of times Mr Ngo has referred to in these documents, especially the occurrence book which you find copies of from page 20.\n\tIf you inspect the occurrence book, the occurrence book which you find copies of from page 20, if you inspect the occurrence book, the original which we will hand up to you, you will see that Mr Ngo was referred there to probably about every day.\n\tYou will see that the nature of the contents of the pocket books, relate usually to inspections of the barracks and it also relates to when he arrived for duty and when he went off duty, and the same goes for the occurrence book.  Here and there you will note that there are inscriptions referring to specific visits to other places, and reports of other happenings which I will try to deal with.\n\tMr Chairman, I don't intend to go through everything in detail and I simply want to introduce in evidence by Captain Koja, just certain inscriptions, just to make it clear for the Committee.\n\tThank you Mr Chairman, I think the witness' language is Sotho.
