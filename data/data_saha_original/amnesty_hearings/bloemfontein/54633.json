I can give you the assurance, two of the three statements are written in Afrikaans and he does not know what it is all about.  He did make a statement in English.  \n\tWhat I'm tying to say is the following:  the only aspect which can have an impact on Mr Ngo's application is the question about which date or when these events occurred and that I've already conceded to yesterday.  It happened in 1984 and not like Mr Mohapi said, in 1986.  \n\tThis is the only aspect which can have an impact on the credibility or not of Mr Ngo's application.
