            "Chairperson, I will proceed and read the affidavit and after that I will go through with the applicant for explanation of certain issues before he is cross-examined.\nThe affidavit reads thus:\n\"I, the undersigned, Luinkuleka(?) Dlova, do hereby make an oath and state that I am the applicant in the Lichtenburg operation.  The facts to which I depose are true and correct and within my personal knowledge, unless the content indicates otherwise.\n\t\tI was born in Cape Town at Kwalanga Township on the 28th day of November 1962 and grew up in the Western Cape.  I did my primary education at Thembanilo Primary and did my Junior Secondary at  Moshes Junior Secondary.  I did standard 8 and 9 at Langa High School and standard 9 at Matanzima High School at Xala in the former Transkei.  I left school in standard nine, due to financial problems as I was born of a single parent.\n\t\tI joined PAC in 1980 through Azanyo.  I was then a member of Langa Youth Movement under the guidance of Rev Moletsane.  I left the country in April 1986 to Zimbabwe via Botswana where I joined Apla.  I left Zimbabwe in June 1986 for Libya and Yugoslavia where I did my military training.  In Libya I was trained in infantry, explosive and guerrilla warfare tactics.\n\t\tIn Yugoslavia I did an intermediate course on intelligence and security.  We were 26 cadres of APLA who underwent this training.  I only remember, amongst those I trained with, Tsepho Mtwetu, Sipho Mhlango and Medisi Ketelo.  I came back from Yugoslavia to Zimbabwe in February 1988.  In Zimbabwe I became involved with PAC/APLA security under the command of the late comrade Mozi Mdluli, until I was deployed inside the country in July 1988.   \n\t\tAs APLA operative, my general instructions from APLA High Command was to prosecute the armed struggle with all means against the then racist minority regime which was undemocratic and oppressive.\n\t\tThe said armed struggle was in essence, a gorilla warfare, during which we as APLA cadres  had to seek and attack the bastions and minions of the then aforesaid regime.  The ultimate objective of the PAC and APLA was not only to topple the then racist minority regime, but to eventually return the land to the majority of the African people.\n\t\tThe bastions and minions of the then erstwhile regime were in terms of APLA prospective, the members of the South African Defence Force, the members of the South African Police and reservists in general, the farmers, as they belonged to the commando structures over and above the fact that they occupied the farms from which we had to drive them away so as to widen our territorial operational base, which was aimed at eventually consolidating the liberated and repossessed land, the white homes which were garrisons of apartheid.\n\t\tMy general instruction was to seek and identify and attack the enemy who was seen in the context of the above bastions and minions of the regime and also to train other cadres and command them in whatever operation that is being embarked upon.\n\t\tIn consequence of, and in pursuit of the above stated objectives, during or about July 1988 I was called by the late comrade Mozi Mdluli, who told me that I was to be deployed inside the country and further briefing will be given to me in Bulawayo by the late comrade Mato Damiole.  I travelled by train to Bulawayo and I was met by Comrade Mandla at the station, who took me to a safe house.  In this house, I met the late Comrade Mato Damiole,  Ike, Castro and Bonge Mabuto.  Thereafter, Comrades Sipho Mhlango, Medisi Ketelo and Tsepho Mtwetu arrived.   \n\t\tThe late Comrade Mato Damiole briefed us that we were to be deployed inside the country to seek, identify and attack the enemy who was seen in the context of the above bastions and minions of the regime.  That was the order that was given to us by the late Comrade Mato Damiole.  Comrade Sipho Mhlango was appointed the commander of the unit and I was appointed the Political Commissar of the unit.\n\t\tWe were given the following arms and ammunition:  1 scorpion, 4 submachine guns, 6 grenades each, that is 2 Chinese grenades each, 2 F1 grenades each, 2 defensive grenades each, made in Yugoslavia, dynamite, TNT, detonating cords, electric capsules, 6 magazines each and extra boxes of magazines ...\"\n...(intervention)",

            "Thank you Chairperson.\n\"We travelled by Landrover from Bulawayo to Botswana borders.  The Landrover was driven by Comrade Ike and Comrade Castro also accompanied us to Botswana.  The arms and ammunition were in our bags.  Comrade Ike dropped us at the borders and we crossed the borders by jumping the fence, accompanied by Castro.  We were met on the other side of the border by Comrade Chand, Nseki and Junior.  We were taken to Comrade Chand's house where we stayed from Friday night until between  12 midnight and 1 a.m. on Sunday morning.  We were taken by Comrades Nseki, Keith and Chand to Ramatlhapane border post.  We crossed the border post by jumping the fence to the side of the former Boputhatswana homeland.  Comrade Tsepho, the commander was the person who knew the route we were going to.\nChairperson:\n\"... we were going to\"\n\t\t\"We walked until we got a lift which dropped us next to Boputhatswana stadium.  Comrade Tsepho and Medisi left us to get transport and they came back with a taxi which took us to the rank.  We took a taxi mini-bus to Johannesburg.  In the taxi were certain different seats.  Comrade Tsepho was in the front seat and I was in the back seat.  The other two comrades were in the middle seats.  The taxi mini-bus drove to Johannesburg.  The taxi was stopped at Lichtenburg in a police roadblock.  One policeman came to the driver and spoke to him and after that all the passengers were told to alight with their bags or luggage and that we must be next to our bags or luggage.\n\t\tWhilst we were still standing in an almost half moon order next to the fence, the commander comrade Tsepho said: 'green' and we knew what that meant.  He threw one F1 grenade to the police and the police started shooting and I also threw an F1 grenade and there was confusion and police were shooting randomly.\n\t\tI ran away during that confusion and hid myself behind a building which I thought it was a church.  When I arrived behind this building, comrade Tsepho was already there.  We then observed from a distance and I saw comrade Medisi talking to other people around the scene.  Since I was a Political Commissar of the unit, I took over the command of the unit because I was sure that the way the police were shooting at comrade Tsepho after he threw the first grenade, he will not survive.  I told comrade Tsepho to take a taxi to Klerksdorp and we would meet there at the taxi rank.  I told him that I would try to signal to comrade Medisi to do the same thing, but I did not manage.\n\t\tI took a taxi to Klerksdorp and passed at a distance from the scene of the shooting as motor vehicles were being diverted.  On my arrival at Klerksdorp, I waited for comrade Tsepho and comrade Medisi, but they never arrived.  I then decided to take a taxi to Johannesburg.\n\t\tAt Johannesburg, I met a person by the name Ranchero.  I asked him to help me with accommodation.  He took me to Alexander township, where he accommodated me.  I read from the newspaper on a Monday morning that one of our comrades was arrested and the other two died.  There were conflicting reports as to how many people died and were injured in the shoot-out.  After some days, I told this person who was accommodating me, that I want to leave the country and he arranged that I meet a certain person in Messina who will help me go to Zimbabwe.\n\t\tAfter a week, I was accompanied by another person to Messina to meet this person who was to help me to Zimbabwe.  When we arrived at Messina, this person was not present but had gone to Venda.  I came back to Johannesburg and from Johannesburg I went to Ficksburg and I crossed the borders on foot to Lesotho.  I went to the offices of the PAC at Sea Point(sic).  It was at Lesotho where I received the information that the person who was arrested was comrade Tsepho.  That also, comrade Medisi died.  It was alleged that he died when he tried to throw a grenade.  \n\t\tIn Lesotho I made contact with Harare and arrangements were made for me to travel to Tanzania.  I did travel to Tanzania and stayed for about a month before I went back to Zimbabwe.  I was again deployed inside the country at the end of 1991, and was stationed in Umtata where I became a head of intelligence of APLA in the former Transkei homeland. I held that position until the beginning of 1995, when I joined National Intelligence Agency.  I am currently employed as Liaison Officer of National Intelligence agency.  \n\t\tI respectfully submit that my application complies with the requirements of the Act and that I have made full and proper disclosure of my involvement in this operation.\"\nChairperson, with your permission, if the Committee would allow me, if the Committee has no questions, I will start at paragraph 6 of the affidavit, if there's no questions  ...(intervention)",

Chairperson, it is my submission that the applicant has met the requirement of Section 20(1) and (2) of the Act and that he was clearly acting on behalf of APLA, a publicly known political organisation and a liberation movement which was engaged in a political struggle against the state at the time.\n\tChairperson, there is evidence which is undisputed, that at the time when the applicant came inside the country and was involved in this incident, he was clearly acting on the instructions of APLA and that has been confirmed by the member of the High Command.  \tChairperson, further, as one of the requirements of the Act, the applicant has made full and proper disclosure with regard to his role in this incident and also it has been established clearly that he did not act for any personal gain when he conducted the operation.\n   Having said that, Chairperson, I wouldn't like to detain the Committee with any argument with regard to this matter, suffice to say that the Committee is well aware, according to the submission of the PAC with regard to its policy as is also clearly stated in the affidavit of the applicant, that the South African Defence Force and the South African Police generally were regarded as pillars of apartheid and that in order to destroy the apartheid you have to fight against those pillars and you have to destroy them.  And it was in that context that the applicant was engaged in the Lichtenburg roadblock with the police.  He was pursuing those goals and those objectives which had been set by the APLA High Command and PAC and as such Chairperson, it is therefore my humble submission to this Honourable Committee, that the applicant met all the requirements of the Act as prescribed and that he should be granted amnesty.\n   Thank you Chairperson, unless the Committee wants me to address it on any other specific points.",
