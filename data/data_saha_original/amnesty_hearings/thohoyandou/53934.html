<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> When did these offences take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It took place on 11th February 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Is that the same date on which the former president Mandela was released?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes it's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now could you explain to the Committee as to what transpired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes I could.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Please do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> On that day of the 11th February 1990 I found people celebrating about the release of President Mandela and people who were talking and then I reached my hand and said how do you we feel this issue of the people who are committing ritual murders and witchcraft which is such an extent they are not working properly with the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's then that the majority of people that what we think we must do or was the solution on that?  I said that where I am staying there is a person called Joseph Tshimbupfe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>he is a ritual murderer and he is disturbing the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's then that a certain TV Mapulani who is staying in the same village said that France Khomogwe is a witch from there, he said a certain person from Dindela called Thomas Ndau said ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was all this when you were talking about these witches?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It was during the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Of celebrating the release of Mandela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I'm sorry, you mentioned a name, you said Joseph and what was his name was a man committing ritual murders.  What was the name of this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Joseph Tshimbupfe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Spell it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> T-S-H-I-M-B-U-P-F-E.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now you say you were at this meeting and you started raising the issue of witches and ritual murders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes it's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Why were you raising these issues?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's because those two people were not making the community to live well or they were not on good terms with the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What were they doing to the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> They were committing ritual murders and others were practising witchcraft.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And did that have anything to do with politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's because the person who was committing ritual murder he was a member of parliament.  I think if I'm sure he was the speaker of parliament, he was holding a high position in government, I think he was the speaker of the parliament.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was that Joseph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes and then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Then as a community we agreed that this way we are celebrating we must also involve him in this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> How involve him?  How were you going to involve him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> By following him and then killing him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Please explain to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> We agreed that it is better as we are celebrating we must also stand there and go there.  We followed him and found him in his cave and then we found that it was past about 6 or 7 ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you want to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Could you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you want to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It was just because he was participating in ritual killings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's be careful now.  You know, you come here to apply for amnesty.  I want you to listen very carefully and I want you to consider your answers very carefully.  In order to obtain or to be granted amnesty the act or offence for which  you apply for amnesty must have been committed for a political reason.  In other words that act must advance or intended to advance a political position.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And secondly, when you testify you must make full disclosure in relation to that act for which you apply for amnesty, do you understand that?  Full disclosure is you must tell us all the relevant aspects of what you did and why.  Do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I want you to explain to us, this decision to kill the witches, how did that relate to a political objective or how did that advance a political stance or position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It is because those people who were in power at the time were working together with both which the power they used they were getting from the Inyanga and the witch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just repeat that I didn't understand you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> They were participating in ritual killings, it was coming from the witch and the Inyanga so that they can be getting respect or just tell everything in the way that we will just admit it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't follow you.  How would killing a witch improve the political stance that you had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It is because those people who were in power, the power to kill the people who they were getting it from the witch and the witchdoctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, so?  How did that become political?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It is related because the people who were ruling by the time they were the ones who was practising ritual murder getting order from the witchdoctor and the witch, that we as Venda we believed that there is no person who can kill a person ritually and not getting order from the witchdoctor or the witch who knows how these things works.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I want you to listen very carefully to me.  You must remember what I explained to you about the Act, the requirements you need to fulfil in order to be granted amnesty.  Remember you must make full disclosure and the acts for which you apply for amnesty must have been done with a political motive that includes advancing your political position.  Okay, do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now I'm going to try to help you now.  I've been struggling to find out from you what political motive was the killing of witches committed or how did it advance your political position or even that of your political organisation.  We are also aware of the fact that at the time there was an approach towards witches where people were starting to reject the idea of the witches practices especially witches murders.  That was quite apart from any political stance or political activity, do you understand.  It's quite separate, there was nothing political about that in some quarters while in fact we also know that in other quarters the attack on witches indeed took on a political flavour.  Now I'm going to ask you a simple question, I'm going to ask now which category did you fall in when you made this decision or party that decision to kill witches but before you answer I may as well tell you now that whatever answer you give, I'm going to ask you why you say so, do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there anything you don't understand?  You can ask now, feel free.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I don't have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, then I'm going to ask you the question.  In which category did you fall when you took the decision that the witches should be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I was supporting that they must be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes because they were involved in ritual killings or because there was political reason to do so, which one of the two or perhaps there was a third one that we don't know, you can tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I was supporting because those people who were killing people ritually I checked and found that there are people who are holding high position in the government who are high officials in the government and even those which who are witching they were working together with those who were  high officials in the government.  Those people who were in power they get the power from the witch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To rule you, do I understand you correctly?  In order to stay in government they got the power to rule from the witches?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Ndou?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.   Now you were explaining to the Committee as to what transpired on that fateful day on the 11th February 1990 and you had just explained that the group had decided to proceed to the kraal so that the people who had been identifying as witches and ritual murderers.  Now you've already indicated that you proceeded to the kraal of Joseph Tishumbupfe.  What transpired when you arrived at Tishumbupfe's kraal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> On our arrival we were singing those freedom songs.  When he saw we were entering and just because we were many he was coming out from the cave.  When he stood in a plain place he said if you come near me I will kill you then he showed a warning then we go back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now when you say we approached, approximately how many people are you talking about here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> We were about 150.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes and after Thishumbupfe had fired some shots in the air?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you belong to a political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes I'm just a supporter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Of ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were a supporter at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes I was a supporter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes but could I put it to you that the ANC never instructed or asked people to kill the witches, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Now why did you do so if the ANC didn't ask you to act in such a way, how do you think would you by killing the witches support the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> We were looking at the government which was ruling us in Venda at the time of Ravello.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was Ravello acting with the government of South Africa or was he on the side of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Ravello's government was ...(indistinct) opposite to the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So in fighting the Ravello government you were fighting the enemy of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes it's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> May I proceed?  Thank you Honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>	Now you were there at Joseph Thisumbupfe's kraal, he comes out, he fires several shots in the air, what happens to you people there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's then that we go to the house of France Khomogwe.  There when we arrived I asked the house which he used to sleep because I was not knowing it then I was shown it by the one who pointed him who mentioned the name that this person is a witch.  In the house there was a light then I opened the door then I get in together with ...(indistinct).  I was holding a big stick, I hold him and then beat him.  I beat him four or five then he get out then he fall to the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> France Khomogwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Is that the deceased in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes it's the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes and after you pulled him out and hit him several times with a stick and pulled him outside what transpired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> When he get out people started to beat him with sticks and stones until he fell down and died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes and what you did, is all that you did according to the way you explained that you only hit with a stick and dragged the deceased out of his hut?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes and what transpired then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> From there we proceeded to Mafune, we didn't find Mafune we found him already flat.  I think that I took out the matches and then I lit the house he used to store medicines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Then under that guy who was called Frederick he also later and Thomas Ndaw also lied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes you can proceed, just explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Then the whole homestead came to be on fire then we get out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Ndou, the name of the owner of hut that's been set on fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> It's Mafune.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> This is not France, it's not his family either, it's a third?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes a third ...(indistinct) that they proceeded to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it was that house that was burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where the house full of medicines were also burnt?  Was he there, Mafune?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> No he was not there.  We didn't find there on our arrival.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And according to your evidence three huts were burnt is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And you only participated in the burning of one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes I'm the person who burnt the first one which was containing the medicines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> I see.  Is there anything that you wish to tell the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes, I want the Committee to forgive me for all these deeds I have done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I'm afraid we can't forgive you but you can certainly ask the victims or the deceased, family of the deceased and the owner of the house that was burnt.  You can ask their forgiveness.  I'm not too sure if they're present but they are the people to whom the request for forgiveness should be made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Have you ever seen any member of the family of these two families?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Who did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I am seeing Jerry Khomogwe who is the son of the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Anybody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I'm seeing the only person here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Nobody from Mafune's house or Mr Mafune himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Even Mr Mafune and any person from that family I'm unable to identify that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In any event if they are here you can still to them even in their absence I suppose but if you want to say something to the deceased's son please go ahead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Myself here, I'm asking him to forgive me.  I don't have much to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why you asking for forgiveness if you don't have much to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's because I have committed a crime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> That is all, Honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NDOU</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr van Rensburg is this one of the cases in which you appear for the families?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson, I have only</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>instructions from Mr Jerry Khomogwe which is the son of the deceased, that is the only instructions and by and large I'd like to confine my cross-examination to that specific incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Honourable Chairperson, if I may just at this stage?  Regarding the arson incident and the victims in that matter, the names of those victims are not mentioned in the application, we accordingly didn't notify, were unaware of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Thank you, may I proceed?  	Mr Mashamba, there's just thing I want you to explain to me.  If you now succeeded in killing all the witches in the whole of Venda, how would that act cause the people in government in power to become powerless?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> They were going to become powerless because most of their power they get them from the witches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Yes but you've got to explain me would they be so powerless that they can't get out of bed in the morning or will the people not hear them or understand them or will the people not follow them?  How would they become powerless?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Having killed the witches I think that is why the people in power in those times are no longer ruling the country because they were unable to rule.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Because you killed the witches?  That's they become incapable of ruling, because you kill the witches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I think where they used to get their power and medicine we eradicated those places.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> No, you're still not answering my question and I have to insist on that.  How did they fail in having power because you killed a few witches?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> All the witches who were known I think they were all killed because up to now since I was arrested those cases of witches are no longer heard about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> No that's fine but that's still not an answer to the question.  Can you answer this question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Can you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Yes, the question is if you've now succeeded in killing a few witches or even all the witches, how did that cause the people in power to lose their power, to become powerless?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> By killing the witches we were limiting the power of the rulers who were ruling during that period so that they will no longer have power so that they will get out of the government and then the government be re-incorporated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Mr Chairperson, I will not labour that point any further, I will continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But perhaps then I could put an example?  The government is like a torch.  If you take out the battery it wouldn't shine and now the witches, they were the batteries of the government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Witches and ritual murderers were batteries of the government because those people who were ruling, they used to get this thing of ritual murder because of these witches and witchdoctors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tell me, what did the deceased do that he had to be killed, what was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> The deceased it was alleged that he made a certain boy who was a soccer player to get missing or to disappear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, but was he a witch, a ritual murderer of a politician or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> He was a witch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> That is known by the person who pointed him, who mentioned his name in the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now what is this about a soccer player?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's that he mysteriously, the soccer player mysteriously disappeared after being called by him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> And until now we don't know his whereabouts since his disappearance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Had his disappearance anything to do with the playing of soccer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> He was a soccer player and he was called by that old man and then he disappeared and he was no longer seen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> There's just one thing which I want to get from you.  If the witches were responsible for giving power to the people in government what concerns me is the fact that on this day it was a day when President Mandela was being released.  Wasn't that an indication that the power of the witches was waning, why was it necessary to kill them because at that time there was an indication that the ANC was unbanned and the leader of the ANC had just been released so why was it necessary to do something to make the country ungovernable and to remove the witches, especially on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's because we were fighting against the government who was ruling us here in Venda so that it must be reincorporated back in South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Thank you Madame.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>	Did you know the soccer player that allegedly went missing because of the action of Mr France Khomogwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Could you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Did you know the soccer player that went missing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes because since then I have not yet seen him again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> What was his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> We used to call him by a nickname, soccer nickname, called Pula.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Now when you met Mr France Khomogwe in his house did you ask him where this Pula is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> No, he was no longer asked about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Why didn't you ask him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> We didn't ask because we had already decided that those people must be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Didn't you think that perhaps his family would have liked to have known his whereabouts before you killed this man who is linked with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> The parents of the missing person were losing hope because it was long that the person had disappeared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Exactly then it was the last chance that you can find out what happened to him by asking the man that you're going to kill?  Must I repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> You see you testified that the parents of the soccer player was now desperate because they're losing hope because the man was missing for a long time and the only link between the missing person as far as you're concerned is Mr France Khomogwe which you are about to kill so if you kill him his family will have absolute no means to ever find out what happened to him?  Now in those circumstances, I ask you, why didn't you ask him before you kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's because we realised that it's long this thing had happened and the parents of the person have already lost hope and they were no longer interested in that matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could you tell us, when did Pula disappear?  You say it was a long time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I think it was in 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Was his disappearance reported to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I think so but I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Did you know Mr France Khomogwe before that specific date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes he was known to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you know he was a witch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> No I used to hear the hearsays about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before the disappearance of the soccer player or only after?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I'm saying yes that I used to hear about him practising witchcraft before the disappearance of this soccer player.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So even the disappearance of the soccer player was hearsay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> No it was true that he disappeared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did you believe the people who told you that the deceased was practising witchcraft?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes I believed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Did you find any medicine in Mr France Khomogwe's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes, medicines were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> What medicine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It was a medicine in bottles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> I want you to give me a description of the medicine in the bottles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Those medicines were sitting in different bottles differently as they are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> You see, why I give you an opportunity to describe this is to give you an opportunity to tell this hearing that it was in fact traditional medicine and you failed to do that.  Should we therefore deduct that it was medicine like cough syrup and things like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Those medicines were the traditional medicines not like cough remedy medicine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> I put it to you that you killed an innocent old man who was never in his life involved in witchcraft?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I don't agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Except for beating Mr Khomogwe with sticks, was he assaulted by the group in any other way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes he was also assaulted by a group immediately when he got outside the house the group that were there began to attack him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> How?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> In beating, when I get inside the house immediately when he went outside the house I failed to see what was happening because the group of people or a mob was on top of him attacking him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Surely you could see how he was beaten or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I can see what was happening because I was close by.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> So tell us, how did they beat him, how did the crowd beat him and with what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr van Rensburg is it in dispute?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Mr Chairperson, I will come to the point in a question or two if you will just allow me this please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>	What I want to know is was he only beaten with sticks until he died or was other instruments used as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> He was being beaten by sticks and stones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Okay and you see the reason why I'm asking you this is because Mr Jerry Khomogwe who found his father's body the next day says that his head was actually flattened, beaten to a pulp.  What do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> No, I can't dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> You agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I can agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Then I have to put it to you that you are seriously trying to downplay the attack on the deceased and the viciousness thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I have explained that I attacked him inside the house and that when he got out the house there were people waiting for him who started to stone him and beat him by sticks by the people who were outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> I have no further questions, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VAN RENSBURG</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS PATEL:</span> Thank you Honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>	Sir, can you tell us, Mr is it Mafune?  His three huts were burnt, not so and you were responsible for setting the first house alight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes I'm the person who burnt the first house which was containing the medicine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay and this was done because Mr Mafune was pointed out by someone as being a wizard, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Who pointed him out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's Thomas Mete.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> And what did he say about Mr Mafune?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> He said Mafune was taking people, making them or turning them into zombis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> And which people would this be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> One of the persons who was mentioned, Florence Mashia, who was alleged to have been taken by that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> And what did Florence do, what type of work did she do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> She was a churchgoer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, was she involved in politics at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> No, she was a church churchgoer as such, she never participated in politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay and anybody else that you know that he supposedly turned into a zombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Others I heard about them but for now I can't recall the names, I'm unable to recall the names of those people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay now from what you're able to tell us, it doesn't appear that any of the victims of Mr Mafune were involved in politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Florence Mishia was a churchgoer and she was not participating in politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay so the intention even though only his house was set alight, the intention was to kill him, not so, initially?  If he was found he would have been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay now what political purpose would that have served?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> We would have ...(indistinct) the powers of the people who were ruling during those days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> But you've just told us that none of the victims of, alleged victims of Mr Mafune were involved in politics so I don't understand your response?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> As I have mentioned Florence Mashia only as a person participating in the politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry.  The people you have mentioned are people who are victims of Mr Mafune.  Now what I want to find out from you, of the people who were ruling or who were in power in Venda who do you know had received assistance from Mr Mafune either by way of muti or some other powers from Mr Mafune who had been assisted by Mr Mafune?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Joseph Thithbupfe, most of the things he used to receive from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Is Joseph the one who was a member of parliament?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> How did you know this that Joseph had received assistance from Mr Mafune?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Because I used to see him seeing that they've got relationship because Joseph used to go to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> So what, just because he went to visit him how do you draw the inference that he was being assisted by him to maintain his power?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's because even when he go and commit ritual murder he was told that if he wants these things to move smoothly he must do like that.  I think most of things he was receiving it from him.  In Venda it is said a person cannot just go out and commit a ritual murder without knowing the reason for doing that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> I'm sorry, I don't understand your response, perhaps I should ask the question again.  How do you know that Joseph was receiving assistance from Mafune to maintain his power.  What did you see that led you to this conclusion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Because he cannot frequent the place without there is nothing ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> What if they were just friends, can you dispute that, is it a possibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I can dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> On what basis do you dispute that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I can dispute because those people they were not of the same age to a certain extent that they can be friends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Did you know Joseph personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Did you know him personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes I know him personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.  Why was he not approached if your dispute was with him and you knew him personally, why was he not approached?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> His person I mentioned that he shot two warnings while we approached him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, sorry yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Is he still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes he is still alive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Is he involved in politics these days or wouldn't you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I don't know because it's long that I've been in jail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Honourable Chairperson, if you would just grant me a moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> The soccer player, Pula who disappeared, was he involved in politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes he was involved in politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> How was he involved, what was his function in politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> He was a secretary who used to write letters to call the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Thank you Honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>	Okay, besides Joseph was there anybody else that knew of that Mr Mafune assisted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay and you say he assisted them by turning people into zombis or he assisted Joseph by turning people into zombis, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I didn't hear your question properly, could you please repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, did Mafune assist Joseph by turning people into zombis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Mafune was the person who turned people into zombis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you ever seen this thing, a zombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> No I've not yet seen that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now how come you can testify that someone changed whatever into a zombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's because the ...(indistinct) where I'm coming from there is a place which that person was alleged to have put all these things and nobody can gain access to that place, not anybody, people don't reach that place, it's the only person who can gain access to that place.  I mean Mafune is the only person who can gain access to that place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But I'm not talking about where he can get access, I'm taking about this thing called zombi.  Do you believe in that it exists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes I believe they are there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How long have you had such a belief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I think at the age of 15 by then I happened to believe that zombis are there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you are now how old?  You are 36 years old now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes I'm 36.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So for 20 years you've believed now that there exists zombis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes I still believe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And through that 20 years you've never seen anyone, any zombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> No I've never met one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why do you continue believing that they exist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's because where I'm referring to at Chimbuve there's a no go area which is said to be a place for the zombis and nobody will have ever reached that place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes but you haven't seen it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's not possible to see them because you can't reach that place where they are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now let's assume that they only stay there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Maybe it's the place for them, maybe during the time that they want to be released to do their job outside there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, well I was getting to that now.  You say that Joseph used zombis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> No, I've said Joseph was the person who committed ritual murder, I didn't say he used the zombis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said Mafune made these zombis for Joseph or did you not say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> No, I didn't mention that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, whoever made it, what is wrong with the zombi?  What is so bad about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's a problem because there will be a person who will be taken and then be turned into a zombi and that person it's believed he or she is not dead, by then they will be making him to work very hard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A slave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now where would they work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I think they used to work in the fields which used to be cultivated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you've never seen over 20 years any zombi in this field or any field?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes but I'm not staying in the same village with that person, I'm staying in the other village.  The only thing is that the villages are close by.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In your village there's no zombis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> No, there's no zombis we were only disturbed by this person who was committing ritual murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> After 20 years don't you doubt the existence of the zombi?  You've never seen one in 20 years, have you never ask yourself do these things really exist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I simply believed that just there is a name that was a name zombi, it means that a thing called zombi did exist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But have you never doubted that it exists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> No I have no doubt, I think from my perception I think they are there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you were told now these people involved themselves in zombis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Could you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were told that Joseph and Mafune and those types of people were involved in the use of zombis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> With Joseph, Joseph was involved in ritual murder.  Mafune was involved in zombis including his friends.  They were involved also including witchcraft but Joseph was only involved in ritual murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Thank you Honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>	From your knowledge who in government did Joseph assist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I didn't hear your question, could you please repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> The question was from your knowledge who did Joseph assist, who did he help with his ritual murders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> He was helping himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Did he himself hold any political position or position in government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes he was speaker of the parliament.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay I think I misunderstood your initial testimony then.  Well perhaps you can explain, excuse my ignorance but if Mafune's speciality if one can call it that, was turning people into zombis and Joseph's was in ritual murders, why would Joseph go to Mafune for assistance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's because Joseph was a ritual murderer but he doesn't know the medicines that is why he had to go to Mafune who knows about the medicines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand it, he would commit the ritual murder, dissect the victim and take the necessary parts to Mafune to manufacture a pharmaceutical result.  Do you follow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> I do, thank you Honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>	So then it seems that we sit here with the unusual position of somebody who holds some kind of political position who committed his own ritual murders in order to enhance his own power.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sure enhance the idea that they used witchcraft to keep their political powers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Perhaps - well then I'm slightly confused, perhaps you can clarify this for me, would ritual murders be necessary for turning people into zombis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Then I don't understand why Joseph would have gone to Mafune.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand Ms Patel, Mafune was an expert in various fields.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Sorry, according to the applicant, his expertise was turning into zombis and that is why he killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In addition to being a witchdoctor and he was able to make this muti or whatever was necessary to maintain power of Joseph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> I'm sorry then Honourable Chairperson, my understanding of the applicant's testimony when I asked him initially why was Mafune pointed out by Thomas Madaw and he said because Mafune was turning people into zombis and then I went on to question him about well, who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said that, it's just that a specific issue there was he was pointed out by someone who informed them that he made people into zombis but another source told him about witchcraft and he believed that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Alright, thank you Honourable Chairperson.  Then I have no further questions thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS PATEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Do you remember the people who were with you when you went to kill France?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes I still remember them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Who were they, who were with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Eric Matosi, Frederick Matata and Thomas Madawe and the fourth one I think Richard Jawuke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Were they also charged in the criminal trial with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes they were also charged but differently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> I mean for the same offence of killing France Khomogwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Were you found guilty do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> They were found guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Do you know if they've applied for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> No they did not apply.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Are they still in prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> They are out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> How many years where you sentenced to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I'm sentenced to 12 years of murder and one year of arson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And now this no go area in the village where the zombis are being kept, what is the name of that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Dindele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> So if we wanted to go there and have an inspection in loco who would stop us there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I'm told that something will come which you won't see disturbing you, preventing you from going there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who would say so?  Who said that you'd be prevented from going there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> It's what I grew up hearing people talking like that and I've never heard of any person who have reached that place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you can't tell us where it is, you can't give us a place or a road to go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I can assure you the road to that place, that that place I can assure you or point that place, that that is the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can take us there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're not scared?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I think I will not reach that place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Don't you think it's time you start thinking about the existence of this place?  I mean accept you've believed it all the years but don't you think it's time you started thinking for yourself about it whether it really exists or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I believe they are there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> ...(inaudible) of what association or movement or party or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The interpreters didn't hear that first statement, could you please repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> The soccer player, Mr Pula who disappeared, you told us that he was the secretary of some association.  What was the name of that association?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> I didn't say he was the secretary of the organisation, he was the secretary of the meetings which we used to hold, he was the secretary who used to write the minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Now who were you people holding these meetings where he was the secretary?  Who was the chairman and what was the name of this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> We'd simply just hold meetings if say that there is a person who is not living in a good way with other people then we just hold meetings and discuss about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> The whole community or the youth or who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> The youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I see, so he was a secretary, he acted as secretary for a youth meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHAMBA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, no further witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Chairperson, I have no witnesses to call.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Same here Honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr van Rensburg, have you got any argument?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG IN ARGUMENT:</span> Yes, just a short argument, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>	As the learned advocate has pointed out the 2nd February, the 11th February was a very significant day in the history of this country.  I can hardly think of any other event that symbolised freedom for the majority of the citizens of this country more than the release of Mr Mandela on the 11th February but at the same time there were a group of people running around still fighting a war that was already won.  This just doesn't make sense.  The applicant has certainly not been able to give an explanation for this strange behaviour.  The applicant has furthermore not been able to explain how the politicians would become powerless if they did succeed to kill all the witches in the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>	It is significant that this applicant is not basing his application on the attempt or an attempt to make the area ungovernable as the previous applicants did.  The fact of the ungovernability of the country was never raised by himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>	In the circumstances I'm of the opinion that is my instructions Mr Chairperson that the element of a political motive was again not proved and found in this instance and again I have to argue that this application has to fail on this basis.  That is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Thank you Honourable Chairperson, I have no address.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr van Rensburg, do you accept that there was a belief in the community that members in political authority resorted to some kind of assistance with the strange powers that witches allegedly had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Yes I can well concede that but I still don't think that that should be end of the argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I accept that, I just want to know what your instructions were on this belief whether your clients or the deceased was party to that or not is another matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Yes I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm just talking of a general perception in the area here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Yes but I would just add that that would be the can I say supernatural powers available to any other member of the community as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Thank you.  Mr Ndou, we don't need to hear you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is this the end of this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will reserve judgement on this as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there any point in starting a new matter now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> It's already 4.15, almost 4.20 Honourable Chairperson, I believe that there's a problem with the sound technicians.</p>
