<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VAN RENSBURG</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.  Mr Mudau, do you know what a petrol bomb is?</p>

<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Is it not so that on the day that the deceased was killed, you were in possession of a petrol bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> Yes, I was having it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> I have no further questions to this witness, your worship, on the basis that the allegations as far as these pertain to his motivation for the attack on that day is at this stage still in dispute.

<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I haven't had a chance to read these documents but has he conceded that he was in possession of a petrol bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> It was in fact one of the facts found during the criminal trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But I'm talking in his affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why didn't you say in your affidavit that you were in possession of a petrol bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> I might have just left it out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Not might, you did.  I'm asking why.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> Maybe I didn't think about it properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) whether you wanted to make any amendments or add anything, why didn't you then do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> I didn't think about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) petrol bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> I threw that petrol bomb over the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> It was on that day of the (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, why?  Why did you throw it at the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> I was burning the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was no decision to do that, wasn't there?  You went there with a petrol bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> It was by the time when the deceased was starting to fight with the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) to fetch a petrol bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> I don't know if people are in the know of what is  a petrol bomb, can I be allowed to explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) what a petrol bomb is.  I know it for years.  The point of the matter is all I'm asking you is on your way to the deceased's house, were you in possession of a petrol bomb or did you only go fetch it after you arrived there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> It was in my possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) went there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> About 12h00.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) intend to do with this petrol bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> I was just having it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) what?  People don't carry petrol bombs for nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> It was just because something that I was used in holding it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) you serious, don't talk nonsense to us.  Why were you in possession of a petrol bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> I was suspected that maybe on our arrival there, after negotiating, if the deceased did not understand, then if a fight broke, then I will throw it in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now why are we suffering to get that kind of answer?  It's a perfectly understandable answer that, instead of coming to tell me that you carry it because you're used to carrying petrol bombs.  I've yet to see people carrying petrol bombs like they carry packets of sweets or money or knives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> I apologise for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) help your case when you say things like that.  So you in particular knew there was a possibility and I must say you have come closest to the reality and probabilities.  You knew that he was likely to resist and therefor you had this petrol bomb with you, just in case, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> Yes, it's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you foresaw the possibility that if that happens, he can die.  Not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> That didn't come to my mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, but when they started throwing stones and you would throw the petrol bomb, it must have crossed your mind 'He can die now' not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUDAU:</span> Yes, the fight was now serious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Patel, did I ask you if you wanted to ask any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> No, you didn't honourable Chairperson but, I don't, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ndou, do you have any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> No, none.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> No questions, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you, you're excused.</p>
