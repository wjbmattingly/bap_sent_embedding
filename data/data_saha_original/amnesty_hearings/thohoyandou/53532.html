<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIOMA:</span> No, at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) Mr Van Rensburg?</p>

<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Mr Sioma, I just want to put it to you that the reason why you attacked the house of the deceased and burned down his house and killed him was because he was suspected of being a witch and the community was frightened of witches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, let's do it one by one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's been put to you that the reason why you participated in killing the deceased was because he was a witch, true or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIOMA:</span> Some of it, that's one of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, secondly it's been put to you, well Mr Van Rensburg, can you carry on then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Thank you.  And that that was the most important reason why you killed him, because he was a witch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIOMA:</span> That is not the only one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> The most important one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIOMA:</span> The most important one is that he was in the midst of witches and that he was disturbing the activities of the youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> You agree that there was prior to the day that he was killed, no decision to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIOMA:</span> The decision of killing him was not there, was never made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> (Indistinct), thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VAN RENSBURG</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Patel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> No, thank you, honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ndou?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> None.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> No questions, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tell me, what do you feel about what you did that day?  What do you feel today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIOMA:</span> For now I'm feeling in my heart very painful, since it happened I'm feeling very concerned when seeing the children of the deceased in front of me now.  In the past I was unable to meet them so that we can forgive each other as we are living together at home...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) are you prepared to make attempts to come to terms with the family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIOMA:</span> Yes, I'm fully prepared that we can live together like before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I would appeal to the respective representatives to make attempts to facilitate such a meeting.  I don't know if it will occur but at least I'm hopeful that it could.  Mr Ndou?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
