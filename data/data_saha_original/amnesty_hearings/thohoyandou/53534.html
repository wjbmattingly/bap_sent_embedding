<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR NDOU:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Rerani, you've signed an affidavit.  If you look at the last page of this affidavit, you'll see there's a signature there, is that your signature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR RERANI:</span> Yes, it's might.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> (Indistinct) agree that this affidavit may be handed in as your evidence?</p>

<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you want to amend anything in that affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR RERANI:</span> No.</p>

<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you, Mr Van Rensburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VAN RENSBURG</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> If you just give me one minute, please.  At the criminal trial, you could not give an explanation as to why you threw the stones at the house of the deceased on 6 April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR RERANI:</span> Yes, it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Can you now give us an explanation why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR RERANI:</span> Yes, I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Let me ask you this, why couldn't you give an explanation at the criminal trial as to why you committed these actions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR RERANI:</span> When I arrived there, the fight was on.  I just joined and participate in throwing the stones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> (Indistinct) why didn't you tell the reason for the attack at the criminal trial?  Why didn't you tell the reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR RERANI:</span> Maybe they asked me in a way that you are not asking me now.  I might have answered it contrary to what you are expecting of me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So, you didn't know the reason for the stone throwing, you just joined?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR RERANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Why did you think they were throwing stones?  Throwing stones at a person could kill him.  Now why would people do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR RERANI:</span> I thought that if, when arriving there, I could just stand and watch them because they would revolt against me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you had no particular reason for throwing those stones?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR RERANI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> No further questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VAN RENSBURG</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> In light of that response, I certainly don't have any questions, honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ndou, have you got any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> (Indistinct) I can't take it.  Perhaps, let me try.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, well, contrary to the belief that you can flog a dead horse alive, I have serious doubts that you could do it today.  There's been no allegation that you practise witchcraft.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> It will be dangerous for me to (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Thank you, very much.</p>

<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) have you any objection to the taking of the oath?</p>

<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> Yes, it's mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Do you also agree that this affidavit may be handed in as your evidence?  Is there anything perhaps also that you want to add to what appears on the affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> Yes, I cannot add anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there anything you want to amend to that that you can think of now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NDOU</p>

<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I've lost my way a little bit here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Honourable Chairperson, perhaps while my learned colleague is finding his way, we haven't numbered this exhibit nor the previous one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I've just sent it for punching, we'll do it as soon as it comes back.</p>

<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) I just thanked Ms Patel for pointing it out, I'd forgotten.</p>

<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Van Rensburg, can we just number these pages, please?  Mr Mudau, his will be Exhibit C, isn't it?  Then we have Rerani, Exhibit D and Ragwala, E.  Are we all in agreement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, thank you for the opportunity.  Mr Ragwala, can you just tell us, what acts are you making application for amnesty for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> Throwing stones at the deceased as well as burning the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> (Indistinct), in what way did you participate in burning the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> Regarding the burning of the house, it's as follows.  I burned the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you do in that episode?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> I took the tyres, as the car was burning, I added towards the flame.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> In paragraph 44 where you describe what your individual participation on that day was, and this fact that you burnt the car is not mentioned there.  Can you give us an indication why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> Could you repeat the question please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Why didn't you tell us through your affidavit and specifically in paragraph 44 that you are asking for amnesty because you burnt the car of the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> It was perhaps out of forgetfulness in explaining.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you talking about the affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But at paragraph 42 it does say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Yes, in fact I did have a look at that, I apologise, I did.  Yes, under the circumstances, I will have no</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>further questions for the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VAN RENSBURG</p>

<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS PATEL:</span> Thank you, honourable Chairperson, just one.  Sir, at the time you stated when you were asked the reason for your involvement, you said you were just throwing stones because you felt like it and because everybody else was throwing stones, is that still your position today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> Could you repeat your question slowly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> At the trial when you were asked as to why you participate in this incident, you said that you were throwing stones because you felt like it and because everybody else was throwing stones, can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> Yes, I do remember, that was when I was putting a statement or writing a statement before the police.  As I was explaining, I did explain that I arrived at the deceased's house and the fight was already on.  I joined in the throwing of stones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> (Indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> Yes, it was true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) know why you throwing stones?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> I knew that we were fighting against the deceased because the deceased had already been told to leave and he refused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> Could you repeat that question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why he was asked, the reason to go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> He was asked to leave because he was suspected of witchcraft plus...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Plus what, sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> He is repeating that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> Because he was suspected of witchcraft practise and also apposing the people at Mahvunga village.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> (Indistinct), thank you, honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS PATEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ndou, have you got any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> In paragraph 20 of your affidavit you state</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>"As the deceased knew that he was on the list of witches and wizards, he made every attempt to disturb any coming together of the youth as a group as he thought it could be to his detriment."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>Were you discussing at these coming togethers your action that </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>would be taken against?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> The question, please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The youth wanted him to go out of the village, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you present at any meeting where the youth discussed (indistinct) 'If he refuses to go, what are we going to do to him?' or about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAGWALA:</span> I remember that in one meeting at the chief's kraal when the late was told to leave because he was apposing the children at Mahvunga, the meeting did not resolve well because it was then that Petrus' house was burnt down.  As the deceased was really fighting against the people and they started singing towards the house.  And that led to the ending of the meeting, not in a peaceful way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you, you're excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>

<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Born in 1973.  Okay you've mentioned five children that were living with you at this stage, around about 1990.  Any other children of the first wife that lived with you then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are there any children that weren't living with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Well except these five, I used to live with these five.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are there any other children that didn't live with you that he had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So in total he had nine children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Okay can you describe for us where did you live at the time when the deceased was killed and the house that you lived in and what were you doing there to support yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Well we were staying at Mahvunga Village.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Describe the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Well he was a hardworker.  He had a farm which could be six hectares.  It had a number of trees, advocado trees and mango trees and orange trees.  He also farmed in tomatoes which he will really export to Delport.  Avocados he will also export to Mr Fish.  We will also plant mealies and that we didn't use our own hands we were using trekkers which we also use different irrigation schemes, spray method.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mrs Mahvunga we all know why we are gathered here.  It's an application for amnesty in respect of the attack on your house that day as a result of which the house was burnt and your husband unfortunately killed.  Basically most of the versions indicate that there was a belief that your husband was involved in the practice of witchcraft, what do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I don't know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it possible that he was involved in it that you didn't know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I don't know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was also alleged that he wanted to assume the mantle of the headman in the area, in the appointed headman's absence, have you got any comments about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No I don't know anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it not true, or is it possible, or is it just you don't have knowledge of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> It's not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was also alleged that he interfered at times, especially after he discovered that he was on a list of people who were thought of to be involved in the practice of witchcraft, that he interfered with political meetings, especially that of the youth.  Do you know whether that occurred, or can't you say or what is the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> It's not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see I asked that question particularly and I gave one of the options is that you may not have knowledge of that because there was an allegation that him and his two sons, I am not too sure if the names of the two sons were mentioned at the time had attacked a group of youth people - oh him and his four sons threw stones at a group of youths who were having a meeting on the mountain and chanting or singing songs involving politics and that was never denied. If you don't know whether that occurred or not then please tell us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I don't know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Is it true that his family, or one of his family members was in fact the headman of the village?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I don't know of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know Adam Mahvunga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes that one I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was he the headman of the village?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was he connected to your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So that's what I am asking you, was a member of the family of your husband the headman of the area or the district if you can call it that, is it true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes it's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Now do you know whether the headmen and the traditional healers and those types of people were actually involved in governmental authority?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't know, okay.  Do you know whether people who were in governmental authority sought assistance of witchcraft to sustain their power?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't know.  Are you aware that witchcraft was in fact practised in the area?  Not necessarily for political reasons but just in general.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Could you repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know whether witchcraft was practised in the area at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't know or was it not practised?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I didn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  So you don't know who, if it was practised you wouldn't know who would have practised it because you don't know whether it was practised, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Well I can say I don't know because I never heard anything about these kind of things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now let us get back to the 28th of February.  Was your house attacked on the 28th of February - that's not the day your husband died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your house was not attacked.  On the 6th of April ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> The house was attacked on the 28th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Of February?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now I don't want to go into the details of who did it and what time they did it.  That attack were you informed as to why that attack took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No I wasn't told.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you not try to find out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes I wanted to find out but I didn't know how I will know and where to get the information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you not ask your husband if he knew perhaps, or your children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I tried to do that.  We asked ourselves because when it was happening there was nobody at home except Boshoff and Eric.  When I came back in the afternoon and when the deceased came back he realised that there was this damage or attack and the boys were trying to put down the fire.  I asked myself as to what was happening at my place, at my home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you couldn't fathom that out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No we could not fathom that out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you ask your husband then or your children was there any possible reason why this could have occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Well we asked ourselves as to how, what is going to happen, what was going to happen, what was the reason for the attack but we could not get an answer because it was myself and my sons, or the children of the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now at some stage we were informed that your husband wrote a letter to the headman which was intended to be read out to the community, do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I don't remember that, I don't know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you don't know anything about a letter that was handed to the headman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I don't know anything about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Do you know or did you go to the headman to seek assistance after this initial attack on the 28th of February?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Well I didn't go anywhere, I was just at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did your husband go to ask assistance from the headman for protection or whatever, or to settle the problems?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> He didn't go anywhere.  Well I think - well I don't remember exactly whether when that had happened as to how the police arrived, but I know the police got involved.  I don't know how they arrived but it so happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did they say when they got to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Well they had already taken the statements and they were discussing the issue with the ...(indistinct) as to whether the boys were identified and it was said nobody identified the boy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see.  Now during that time shortly or a couple of weeks before your husband eventually died did the police come there to your husband to say he must leave the area or don't you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On the day he died did the police come there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To tell him he must go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Until the day he died were you aware that the people were wanting him to leave the area with or without his family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Could you repeat the question please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Up to the day on this attack where he died were you aware that certain people of the area wanted him to leave the area with or without his family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I don't know because nobody came to bring that kind of information to tell us to leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At the time that there was this attack before he died was the possibility of him leaving the area never raised?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was just this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes it was just - that's when I came back on the 28th there was this attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No I am talking about the 6th when he died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes, now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was no indication that they wanted him to leave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When this attack started did they say why they are throwing stones at him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Nobody explained as to why they were throwing stones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was no shouting that he must go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Nobody said a word, they just acted because that was why they were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see.  How long were they there?  How long were there visitors or strangers at your house in or just outside your fence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Well it took a long time, a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see.  Did these people come, maybe a smaller group at about 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Since the beginning of the day till late afternoon nobody came.  They came in the afternoon to do the job.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright.  Now were you at home when they came there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes I was at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was your husband there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes he was at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did anybody come inside the house to talk to you or him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did they just start to throw stones from outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes that's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that what drew your attention to the people outside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you go outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I could not go out.  I just started looking for the keys and locked the doors and we stood in the passage with the children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did your husband say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> He was out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Out of the house, within the yard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was talking to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I cannot tell exactly whether he was talking to them or he was doing something else because I didn't see that.  I was in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So as I understand your evidence you don't know why they threw stones at your house and you don't know why they killed your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes what I can say briefly is that what I observed on my own was the fact that they were jealous because before there was this burning and destruction and attack they went to the farm and they burnt all the trees, avocados and all the beehives were destroyed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know who did that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I can't tell you exactly because when it happened I was at home, because it is far.  The farm is quite far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you don't know if it is the same people who killed your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Well in my own view I think it was necessary to blame the same people - to associate them with the destruction at the farm because it came as an act even at home until his death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So that is just an opinion you hold, that it's the same people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You've heard the evidence of most of these applicants.  It seems that there was a perception at the very least that your husband was involved in the practice of witchcraft, whether that is true or not is beside the point.  And you have also heard that he interfered with the attempt to have political meetings.  And you have also heard that their problems with witches, they say, was related to a desire to have a restructured political dispensation in this area.  If they would come and want to make peace with you and your family what would your attitude be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Well personally - are you referring to me forgiving these people or trying to come to terms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Come to terms and reconcile with the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Personally if I were to reconcile with these people who destroyed our ...(indistinct) I do have a lot to say and explain to them, because what they did, even if I can live for a hundred years I cannot forget.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No I can understand that.  It's difficult to forget the important things in one's life.  I am asking are you able to see your way clear, not to forget, nobody can ask you to forget your husband and what happened, but to reconcile with the community?  Are you able to do that or are you able to consider the possibility of doing that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Well personally it cannot be possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So even if they make approaches to you to make friends and to reconcile you are not happy to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I cannot do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Where have you been living since the death of your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I have been staying near the police station for one year and two months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And did you go back to Mahvunga afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No I didn't go back to Mahvunga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And today where are you living?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I am staying at Chirore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr van Rensburg are there any other aspects you want to raise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Ja, just one or two thank you Mr Chairman.  If you are staying that from the date of the attack on your house, that was the 6th of April, for a period of one year and two months you lived at the police station, can you just explain to us why?  Why didn't you go back to the area and rebuild your house and continue living there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Well it was difficult because firstly as I was living at the police station even my children were afraid of going to the shop because they were going to meet these boys.  As their mother I was threatened, intimidated and so hurt because they used to share the same food with my kids.  That really led me into saying I cannot go to a very dangerous place because I know I can still see that dangerous zone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> The evidence was led from the applicants that they had absolutely no fight or struggle or grudge against yourself and the boys, and they only aimed their attack at your husband, and even allowed you to escape from the house.  What do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Well let me put it clearly.  Well if it were possible and if there was no fight at all between them and my late husband if you consider that they were cooperating they would have really stayed with him and shown him the good way of living, not really through a fight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>	And besides as we left the house we did not leave through the gate, we jumped the fence and left the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That may be so but they could easily have attacked you while you were jumping over the fence, isn't it?  And perhaps even killed you, couldn't they?  There was opportunity to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes it's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that's why they are saying they allowed you and the children to get away.  I am not saying that that is true, I am just saying that is what their evidence is.  And that's why they are saying that they allowed you and the children to escape.  Can you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes I do understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> What or did you sustain any injuries on that day when they attacked the house on the 6th of April?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes I sustained injuries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Where and from what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Next to the eye.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> What was the injury?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Stone throwing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Now the question is easy, do you believe that when you were hit with that stone that that stone was aimed for yourself or do you think the stone was aimed at your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> It was directed to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see who threw it at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes I saw the person who threw the stone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Can you tell us ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would he not have directed ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> It was Amos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would he not have directed it at the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> The stone was aimed at a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Were you at that stage outside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I was right in the room and I was going to fetch the money which was in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And was Amos in the house when he threw that stone at you or did it come from outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> It was outside but it directly next to where I was in the room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So how were you able to see that it was Amos that threw the stone at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I was directly looking towards the place where he was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At the window?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes, through the window, I could see him through the window.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Was your husband in that same room at that stage with you when you were hit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No he was in the passage with his children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> From the evidence further led by the applicants they seem to have made the allegations that your husband was not sympathetic, he had no sympathy with these people singing the freedom songs, in fact opposed the people who sang the freedom songs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> He did not oppose that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Can you tell us what, as far as you know, he did oppose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> He opposed the issue of burning the houses that the youth were doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> And these young sons that lived with you and also the daughters that lived with you in the house, did you stop them from taking part in the political activities of the youth in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Sorry repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Did you stop or discourage the children that lived with you from participating in the political activities of the youth in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No I didn't say anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr van Rensburg the deceased and the family did they support or were they members of any political dispensation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Perhaps I can ask that question thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>	Can you give us an indication, you lived with the deceased, can you give us an indication what was his political feelings towards freedom and the government of the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> I cannot explain.  I never heard him discuss politics or government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Did you ever hear him opposing the freedom struggle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Can you just give us an indication of what you have lost?  Now we know that you have lost the house because it was burned down.  You have lost the tractor and the vehicles that were burnt out.  Can you give us some indication of what else you have lost because of this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Well as it was already explained, the cars, the house was destroyed, the window panes, the beds were burned, the wardrobes were burned; dining room suite and clothes.  We didn't have any clothes after the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> So you basically lost everything.  Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Yes everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> And what I want to ask you is, one of the applicants testified that at a later stage, after this attack on your house, there was some money collected as compensation and this money was handed to the Chief, have you received such compensation or any compensation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No I didn't receive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Have you heard that the community has collected money for yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No I didn't hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Is there anything else you want to add to your testimony?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VAN RENSBURG</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> The four small children, who supported them and paid for their school fees or anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> There are two boys who were working or who are working, Boy Ntheteni and Aubrey.  These were the people who were staying on the Reef who after the death of the late when I had gone to the place where I am now staying they were the ones who were supporting us, or are supporting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ndou have you got any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NDOU:</span> Just one or two questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a>	I just want to find out from you, since you now live at Chirore is it correct that the other children of the deceased never left their home, they remained there all the time?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> Well I can say that after the death of the deceased these two boys, Eric and Boshoff went to town to their brother.  Maureen went to her aunt and the house was empty.  When they were in town they thought that it will be difficult to get back home because there won't be - then they came back, sold</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>the tractor and repaired the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> I see.  And do you know that the children of the deceased have a good relationship with some of the applicants since some of them were released in April?  Are you aware of that?  And that they play soccer together, they attend functions together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAHVUNGA:</span> No I don't know because I am no longer staying with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> I see.  That is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NDOU</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Patel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS PATEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson no further evidence will be led from the victims' side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Patel do you intend to call any evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> No I don't Honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that - we've done with the evidence now?  Mr Ndou have you got any argument?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Well without trying to be redundant I wouldn't want to - I think the evidence is well placed before the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr van Rensburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman. I would actually like to address the Committee and I see it's now five to one, may I just ask what your time - what our time schedules are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How long do you plan to argue for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> I think it will take about 20 minutes to perhaps 30 minutes and if it can be accommodated I would like a little bit of a break just to organise it and perhaps and that will also shorten the proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How is half-an-hour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Ja that's fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr van Rensburg it's been suggested that we make an offer to you that you submit written argument within seven days.  I don't know if that will suit you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Yes that will suit me fine.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Patel have you got any argument?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> No I will leave it in the hands of my colleague.  The only thing I wish to say would be on the question of the approach to witchcraft matters and I am quite willing to file heads of argument in that regard at a later stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes we've come to the end of this hearing.  I wish to thank the people who were involved in the logistics of arranging this hearing.  In particular I wish to thank the contribution of the interpreters.  I know a lot of people taken them for granted but they do a most important bit of work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>	I wish to thank all those who were party to this hearing and took the matter seriously.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>	We have listened to this evidence and we intend to consider the facts of the matter and to determine whether the applicants singularly are entitled to amnesty or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a>	I wish to thank the three legal people for the assistance they've rendered, though to differing degrees.  And I want to address the applicants and members of the family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>	It is true that this country has been ravaged by various actions involved in political considerations.  The reasons for those are embedded in the history of this country.  Many people have died unnecessarily.  We are now living in a new type of country where everybody is regarded as a human-being; where everybody has their rights, in particular that of the vote; there is a democracy in this country now and it is improving as time goes on.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>	We must realise that there is a society within South Africa.  We have got to start living together despite what has happened in the past - black and white and those who held different political views.  It is to be hoped that the applicants in this particular application, and those members of the family who were the victims of whatever happened on the 6th of April can see their way clear to entering the society as normal people.  And it is to be hoped further that as time goes on that the wounds can be healed.  I cannot hope that people would forget their loved ones, but I can certainly hope that they can start living together and bury the hatchet.  It doesn't mean that if you are able to forgive that you must forget.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>	I thank you.</p>
