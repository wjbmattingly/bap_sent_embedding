<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are we ready to proceed?  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I see you're looking at me.  Visser on record.  Perhaps you would like some feedback on the position of the victims.  I didn't make enquiries this morning.  I see there's nobody here to represent them.  Perhaps Ms Thabethe wishes to address you on that before we start with the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can we proceed in their absence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair.  I will be representing the interests of the victims in this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, they're not here, but we can proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They are aware of the fact that we are starting at half past nine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Chair, they were present yesterday, they are aware.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Yes, Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, before we get down to the amnesty application in regard to Mr Cele, we have made good our threat yesterday of drafting a further document for you in regard to the violence in Natal and which also refers to Operation Vula.  If you have Exhibit A which we handed in yesterday, before you, Chairperson, could I ask you to turn to page 20 of Exhibit A and could I ask you and the Members of your Committee to tear out from page 20, the rest of those pages of Exhibit A.  We will now hand to you a document which will run from page 20, which will replace the documents which you've now torn out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>	Mr Chairman, while we're about handing up to you documents, we have prepared for you an extract from the written presentation made by the Foundation for Equality before the Law.  You will recall, Chairperson, that that's quite a thick document.  I've got one in my hand.  You will recall - you will remember when you see the cover page, what that document looks like.  We're not going to deal with that whole document.  What we've done is we have extracted Chapter 17 from that document and Ms Thabethe has kindly assisted in making copies for you, Chairperson, and we will ask you to accept that as Exhibit B, which we'll hand up to you.  Perhaps I should hand to you these documents now so that you can follow better.  May I approach, Chairperson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, please do.  You'll hand us the substituted pages as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> These are the substituted pages, Judge, that's part of a, b, c, d.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, the substituted pages will be the first document.  That won't be given a new exhibit number because that forms part of Exhibit A.  And it now runs to page 35 if I'm not mistaken, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, it does.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Then you have a document which is headed "Chapter 17", we would ask you to mark that Exhibit B.  That's the extract from the Foundation for Equality before the Law.  B for bravo.  Oh yes, my attorney just reminds me that that document, the Foundation's document, was the original Exhibit P45.  So we mention that as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>	Then Chairperson, you'll see another document.  That document has a chap, a rubber stamp on the top of it stating "Facts to Gail Wannenberg".  Chairperson, this document was made available to us by the TRC on the last occasion when we appeared before your brother, Justice Wilson, Malan and Sigodi, in the other applications concerning Natal incidents.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>	We make that available to you, Chairperson.  We won't specifically rely on it, we're not even certain whether all the detail here is correct.  But it is an interesting document.  It was compiled by a Dr Robert Henderson from Canada and it gives an interesting perspective on Vula.  And that is for your own reading pleasure, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>	Then lastly, we hand up to you a summary of the evidence of Lt-Col Botha, who will be the first witness.  And may we suggest that that be marked Exhibit D.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I don't propose to deal with the new pages 20 and further from the bar as it were, Col Botha who is now going to give evidence in the Cele matter before, when we commence with that matter, is far more au fait with the facts and we thought it better for him to run through that document with you, so that if there are any questions which may occur to the Members of the Committee, they could raise it with him because he's the ideal person to deal with issues which may arise from Vula and Butterfly etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr Visser, I don't have a copy of Exhibit D, can you perhaps assist me please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm terribly sorry, Chairperson.  Terribly sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Well Mr Chairman, if you are satisfied so far, then we are ready to proceed with the Cele matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, please do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, we appear in the kidnap and killing of Mr Dion Cele, on behalf of Col Botha, Col Vorster, V-O-R-S-T-E-R, and W/O Wasserman, W-A-S-S-E-R-M-A-N.  Perhaps you would require the other interested parties perhaps to just place them on record, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, well I think we already have, we did that yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  If I may proceed then, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I call Col Botha to give evidence.  He prefers to give his evidence in Afrikaans.  He is ready to be sworn in.  He had no objection to taking the oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">H J P BOTHA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Mr Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>	Mr Botha, you are an applicant for amnesty in the application with regard to the abduction and killing of Mr Dion Cele.  He is also known as Mr Mbova, M-B-O-V-A Mzimela, M-Z-I-M-E-L-A.  His MK name as Charles and he had an alias, Dion Cele.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Your amnesty application can be found in the Cele bundle, from page 19 to 34.  Do you confirm the content and the correctness, with the exception of any amendments or adjustments that you wish to bring to the evidence of your official amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, the incident is at page 29 of the bundle.  You will probably not find it necessary to refer to that bundle, in view of Exhibit D.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But that is where it is - where it resides in that bundle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You have also compiled a statement along with your legal representatives, in which you according to your current recollection have summarised the facts of the matter, and that can be found in Exhibit D.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you also confirm the content and correctness of Exhibit D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In Exhibit D you refer to Exhibit A, that is the general background, and do you have personal knowledge of the matters with regard to annexure A, insofar as they refer to Lesotho and Botswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now with the exception of those two aspects, do you confirm according to your knowledge and insight, the correctness of Exhibit A?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If we could then page through Exhibit A, I would like you to go to page 20 of Exhibit A, actually page 21.  And then when I ask you to submit to the Committee the circumstances as you understood them with regard to Swaziland and Natal.  Would you be able to do so please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Certainly.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>"Chairperson, during a summit which was held at Simonstown approximately at the end of 1980 or the beginning of 1981, during which all the members of the Security Committee were involved, among others a decision was made that the information collection and actions in Swaziland, even though they were situated outside the borders of the RSA, fell below the auspices of the Security Branch of South Africa for the purposes of the collection of information and the execution of duties."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We are not really certain of the definition of operations in those circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>MR BOTHA</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>"Because the South African Police had no statutory powers to act in an independent neighbouring country, it meant that actions in Swaziland would be illegal.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>		However, an agreement was made with the Swaziland authorities two years before the Umkomati Accord, which made provision for actions in Swaziland prima facie."</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see that we did not add this. The Umkomati Accord was signed in 1984?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that means that the Swazi Accord would have been in 1982?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This is the agreement with the Swaziland Government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 1982?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>MR BOTHA</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>"It was the knowledge of the members of the Security Branch that intermittently from Mozambique through and in Swaziland, an active role was fulfilled by high profile MK members in the planning and execution of violent actions in the RSA.  That weapons of war were smuggled by and through Swaziland to the RSA.  That a great deal of terrorists had left the RSA and after they had completed their military training, had returned to the RSA via Swaziland.  That there was an extensive network of safehouses and other facilities with which terrorists were supported.  That financial and logistical support was provided to such persons in Swaziland.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>		Due to the geographical proximity of Natal to Swaziland, the activities of the liberation movements in Swaziland became known to Natal.  The Security Branch Eastern Transvaal was naturally also affected by this.  Due to their intelligence capacity, the Security Branch was kept up to date very well with activities and personalities and their activities in Swaziland.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>		The Security Branch was up to date regarding who the ANC operatives were and what their intentions were.  By means of well-placed informers they regularly received information regarding the terrorists and weaponry that would enter the RSA, as well as the routes along which they would travel, as well as the situation of the DLBs and safehouses.  The DLBs actually refer to weapon stockpiling location and not necessarily points of information.  They also had knowledge about safehouses, contact persons and so forth, which placed them in a capacity to act in future.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>		Swaziland also played an important role in the execution of the ANC/SACP alliance's Operation Butterfly and Operation Vula.  In Swaziland certain structures had been established by the ANC/SACP alliance and had been operated as such.  There was an RPMC, a Regional Politico Military Committee under which the so-called political committee and a military committee functioned."</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and for the convenience of the Committee two quotes have been taken from the Further Submissions of the ANC to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of the 12th of May 1997.  The first deals with the period from 1983 to 1985, and that refers to page 48 and 49 of that document.  And the second refers to the period from 1985 to 1990, and that is from page 53 of that document.  And that basically deals with the committees and the personalities involved in those activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now with Natal itself, could you submit to the Committee from page 25, paragraph 79.  Chairperson, I'm going a bit quickly ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's quite alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I suppose you understand what I'm referring to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm referring to the Further Submissions and Responses by the African National Congress to questions raised by the Commission for Truth and Reconciliation of 12 May 1997.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Please do stop me if ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, you carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>	Please continue, paragraph 79 from Exhibit A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>MR BOTHA</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>"Chairperson, with regard to the province of Natal and with the exception of somewhat uncoordinated commission of violence which was experienced across the country, Natal suffered the consequences of two highly organised structures of the ANC/SACP alliance, namely Operations Butterfly and then Operation Vula.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>		Operation Vula which was established in the final phases of 1985 and went to 1990, but which was actually aimed at lasting much longer ..."</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was a five year plan, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes.  And it had to lead to the unleashing of a civil war.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>"During the five years an infrastructure would be established within the country and weapons would be stockpiled within the country.  And according to the plan the masses would be politicised to such an extent that they would spontaneously rise up if there would be a spark to the so-called flame.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>		By these means the Vula operatives did not commit violence ..."</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> They were busy with preparations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And we will hear later what the spark or one of the sparks at least were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>MR BOTHA</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>"Operation Butterfly was a structure of MK.  In other words it was a purely military structure within the ANC, or at least a purely military operation within the ANC.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>		While those members shared very much the same objectives as Operation Vula, they were more violently oriented and committed acts of violence.  Operation Vula in contrast was an operation of the SACP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>		Initially, during the '80s, Natal was into three security divisions within the SAP, namely Division Natal with the head office in Pietermaritzburg, Division Port Natal, with the head office being Durban and Division Northern Natal, with the headquarters being Newcastle.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>		It is important to mention this due to the fact that over the period of the 1980s, initiatives were brought in from the three divisions which later became one, Division Natal."</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And in which year did this take place, can you recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> I cannot recall the precise year, but I would think that it was in 1988 or '89.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Very well.  That is when there was only one Division Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Very well.  In the following paragraph, 83, you have given a background of how your staff was numbered, with specific reference to Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you have also given the position of Col Andy Taylor.  And if we look at the bottom of page 26, where Mr Botha gives evidence, you say - and you refer here to the evidence that you gave in the Ndwandwe amnesty application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>"Mainly in command was Col Andy Taylor with an investigation unit directly under his command."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>Now his unit was actually a unit that dealt with research regarding terrorism.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, it was a terrorist unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was a terrorist unit.  And furthermore you say in your evidence before Judge Wilson and the Committee Members</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>"And there was an MK Intelligence Unit, which was under my command."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>That is below you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And then we speak of manpower and you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>"Chairperson, in total at the Security Branch (and you refer to Durban) we were about 200 members."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>Does that refer only to Durban?</p>

<blockquote class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>"Chairperson, Natal was a boiling pot of violence, especially from 1985 the violence escalated.  Col Andy Taylor kept an informal record of incidents in which he kept record of the acts of terrorist as they manifested themselves.  A copy of this was handed over to the TRC's Investigative Unit in Durban in 1997 and also served as an annexure or an exhibit in the Ndwandwe amnesty application."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And there you refer to Exhibit A.  Mr Chairman, this was a document written in manuscript, which we retyped at the time.  We can hand it to you so that you can get the feel of the document.  Mr Chairman, what it deals with is it deals with the dates, the places where violence took place, it gives a reference number, it gives a description of the type of violence and where there was a result it gives you that.  We are not going to formally hand this in as an exhibit, but we will make this available to you to page through to get the general feeling of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If we require it we will do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, if you find that you would like that as an exhibit, then clearly we will reproduce it for you and we will hand it in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.  So in paragraph 85, the Exhibit A is this document here ...(intervention)</p>

<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But it gives a running commentary on the violence as it were, in Natal.  Then Mr Chairman also in the Ndwandwe amnesty hearing, in the record at page 568 and following, that document is discussed and summarised in the evidence of Mr Botha.  And we've given you that reference at page 27 of Exhibit A.</p>

<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now one of the things which took place here in Natal was the so-called Operation Butterfly.</p>

<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that is the one which fell below Umkhonto weSizwe, is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Could you inform the Committee with regard to the brief summary that we have compiled regarding Operation Butterfly please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Chairperson - or before I continue, let me just explain to you that in the past MK operatives or trained terrorists would infiltrate the country, carry out an order which had been given to them, either in Zambia or in Swaziland, and then they would withdraw again.  Either that, or in other circumstances they would be arrested, prosecuted and sentenced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>	Now in the case of Operation Butterfly there was a shift of emphasis from the usual to an establishment of a high profile infrastructure within the RSA, consisting of trained MK operatives or terrorists, who wen they had established themselves within the country would be supported or were supported by local members of MK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's within the country?</p>

<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>		Now the Amanzimtoti limpet mine explosion on the 23rd of December 1985 was one of the more prominent examples of terror which were committed by this particular group."</p>

<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct, and I will explain what DPMC stands for.  It is Durban Politico Military Committee, because that was the area in which they were actively involved.</p>

Could you then briefly address us regarding Operation Vula, on page 30, paragraph 97 and following.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>"Operation Vula, and as it appeared from the document which was compiled by Ronnie Kasrils "Politics on the Armed Struggle - the Revolutionary Army, appeared to have the following ideas as its basis.  Kasrils' idea was that the internal bases of power had to be established by advanced attachments of MK.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>'The development of the armed struggle is dependent on its being rooted among the people.  Our MK combatants and organisers must therefore base themselves amongst the people in order to involve the masses in a people's war.'</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>		Trained MK cadres had to activate the masses politically:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>'The armed struggle must compliment mass struggle and we seek to combine all forms of struggle, violent and non-violent, legal and illegal.'</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>		The underlying strategy was:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>'Political and strategy determines military strategy and our combatants and organisers must be imbued with political theories and ideas, must understand politics guides the gun.'</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>		The central concept for the operation was that a power basis had to be established within the borders of South Africa, which would replace the necessity to leave the country to obtain training and swallows the necessity of receiving orders from outside the country.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>		Kasrils' idea of a basis of power within the country was accepted by the ANC/SACP alliance, but the viewpoint was that it was ANC leaders and not MK cadres who would have create the basis of power and politicise the masses.  There would have to be an abbreviation of the communication from the front of the struggle to the head office in Lusaka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>		The operation would have three corner stones, namely: a) political combat work, military combat work and the intelligence work, specifically aimed at the SAP, the South African Defence Force and National Intelligence Services, as well as other targets which would be identified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>		Vula was launched during December 1986 and would be a five year operation.  The ultimate objective was a violent revolution.  Vula's origin was preceded by a preparation phase which had already been initiated in 1984/1985.  Legends were created for the prominent members who were involved in Operation Vula, namely Mac Maharaj played the key role in Operation Vula.  He would have cancer and would have to be treated for five years in Russia."</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  There are various deviations or other perspectives which have been offered by other persons.  For example, that he would have had kidney problems or whatever the case may be.  The fact of the matter remains that the legend that was created for him would have indicated that he needed five years of medical treatment in Russia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That's correct.  "Dit sou verduidelik sy afwesigheid binne die strukture van die ANC in Lusaka". ...(no English interpretation)</p>

<blockquote class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>"High profile ANC/SACP members had to operate covertly in the RSA and establish an infrastructure for the establishment of underground structures, DLBs, once again for the purpose of weapons stockpiling, safehouses, transit facilities, as well as a communications network.  The plan was that the armed struggle would fall under the direct internal command of the MK commanders who were present in the country.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>		Within the ANC itself it was a secret movement.  It was only in selected groups.  Only selected groups were aware of it and acted supportively for this.  The initiative for this came from the SACP.  And one could draw the golden thread from the involvement of individuals within operation Vula, that all of them were registered members of the SACP and/or that they were considered for action within the SACP."</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I wonder if we could just pause there and just refer to Exhibit C, where on page 4 reference is made to the secrecy - in paragraph 3, from the top of the page.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>"The authorisation for implementing Operation Vula was a "Top Secret" NEC resolution, taken in 1986, working out of the ANC headquarters in the Lusaka.  The operation was placed under the President's project, chaired by ANC President, Oliver Tambo and included Joe Slovo as principal planner, Mac Maharaj as principal recruiter and in-country commander, Siphiwe "Kebusa" Nyanda, as deputy in-country commander, Ivan Pillay as administrator responsible for project co-ordination and a few others."</blockquote>

<blockquote class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>"The major objectives of Operation Vula were to relocate senior and middle-level leaders from the ANC external leadership into South Africa to create a nation-wide underground network to co-ordinate and support a general insurrection against the apartheid State and to penetrate the South African governmental and security structures for the purposes of intelligence collection and covert disruption.  	But for Vula to succeed it had to create an underground organisation far more sophisticated, secure and secretive than the ANC and its military wing, Umkhonto weSizwe had been able to achieve to that point in the armed struggle.  In addition, it had to create or obtain a secure means of real time communication between the external leadership at the ANC headquarters in Lusaka (Zambia) and the Vula operational command inside the country.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>			Its existing communications system with internal underground operatives, consisted of a combination of one-time inscription pads, air flight couriers, cross-border smuggling messages etc."</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>Now Mr Chairman, if you will allow me to confuse you even a little further, from the Internet there is a document available, which can be down-loaded.  It is called "Talking to Vula" and it is by a Mr Tim Jenkin.  He was a gentleman who lived in England and who developed and perfected this one-time encryptic pads and the communication system which evolved through telephone modems talking to computers, which allowed instant same time access, both from South African, Lusaka and England.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>	Now it's an instructive document to show how it evolved.  And if you are at all interested, Chairperson, it is available on the Internet as I stated, under the heading "Talking to Vula".  We have a copy thereof, which again we can make available to you.  We don't believe it really is more than of interest value to you, but of course it is available if you want it.</p>

<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> We are referring from 1988 to approximately 1990.</p>

<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Mr Chairman, if we may refer you to Exhibit B for bravo, at the page which is marked 117, paragraph 10.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just hold it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Paragraph 10 reads - a particular aspect, which is of the most significant importance is the content of a particular paragraph which appeared in an encoded message sent from Mac Maharaj in Johannesburg, to Siphiwe Nyanda in Durban on 24 June 1990, a mere 13 days before the arrest of the Vula operatives commenced.  The said paragraph reads as follows.  Yes, my attorney has a computer printout, but it's unfortunately not here, but this appears to be a correct quotation from that encrypted message.  The said paragraph reads as follows</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>"In the meantime we have had word from Cleo, codename for London, that Donald, codename for Chris Dlamini, will be coming into the country round the end of June 1990.

From the description that Ntabo gave me, one of the pieces seems to have an optical sight and given the internesent (there's a comment to say, it should probably mean internecine) struggle within the enemy camp I am attracted to borrowing one of those pieces if it is suitable for use by us, even if on a temporary basis."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>	And Chairperson, further down the document it appears that when Mr Nyanda was arrested secretive compartments were found in his car.  At the bottom of page 118 there is a reference to that.  It was a Toyota Cressida and in one of the compartments was found a 45mm submachine gun, serial number so-and-so and an optical night-sight for that weapon.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>	Chairperson, in the other side of the story the little booklet that was given out by Gen Herman Stadler, on the very last page you will find photographs of that car and the weapon which we've just referred to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>	Now just in conclusion with regard to the general background - and I now refer you to Exhibit C, Chairperson.   The first paragraph "Discovery of Vula", Dr Henderson says in Exhibit C:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>"On the weekend of 6 July 1990, the South African Security Police picked up two suspected African National Congress underground operatives in Durban.  Mbuso Shabalala and Charles Ndaba were in fact part of a major ANC underground operation to create the political and military structures necessary for launching a general insurrection - a people's war - within South Africa, a covert operation which had been running for two years unknown to the South African Security Forces."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>And that refers to the person, Ndaba and Shabalala, who are also the subject of another amnesty application in the current session before the Amnesty Committee here.</p>

<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And do you find yourself in concurrence with the summary that I have just read to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, I do agree with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, thank you for allowing us to deal with those.  If we may now return to the incident, with the following comment.  After this moment, Chairperson, we will not deal, unless you specifically require us to do so, with any political or general background any longer.  We believe that we have placed what is necessary before you and this will form the basis of all the amnesty applications in regard to all the incidents mutatis mutandis, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you very much.  Yes, I think Mr Visser, you may proceed.</p>

You have referred to Exhibit A and we have heard the aspects of that document that you know about.

<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you have just - I think there are A's on the first place, I think it should actually be a B.

<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If we can then page to page 2.  Could you inform the Committee regarding your share and knowledge in this incident please.</p>

<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>	I refer to the amnesty application of Lt-Col J A Vorster with regard to this incident and concur with it insofar as it is of application to me.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>	My further share in the incident was the following. I confirm that we had information which indicated that Cele would be willing to co-operate with us as an interpreter(?).</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now the complete background is given by Col Vorster and among others reference is made to this information which was supposed to have come from an informer.  Now usually it would not have been expected of you to expose the identity of an informer, but with regard to this specific case I understand there can be no prejudice should the name of the informer be made known.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now can you tell us who the informer was who made this information available to the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What are we talking about, the information that Dion Cele is prepared to work for the government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, Chairperson.  And this particular person is also involved in the kidnapping, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I beg your pardon ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And in this particular case, we are satisfied that there can be no harm if we disclose the name to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> The informer which was handled by Col Vorster and the others in Pietermaritzburg was one, Neville, also known as Goodwill Sikhakane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, I don't know whether you have the document - no, my attorney tells me you don't have it, but Goodwill Sikhakane is also the subject of another incident for which amnesty will be asked, but not before you during this session.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see.  Anyway, just carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Very well, proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you informed by this man, Neville?  He was the informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And who did he inform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Neville was handled by Col Vorster in Pietermaritzburg and at that stage the divisions Natal and Port Natal and Northern Natal still functioned separately from one another, but due to our success in Port Natal and the recruitment of infiltrated ANC terrorists, which we could redeploy into the structure of MK, Col Vorster liaised with Taylor here in Durban and asked for assistance in this recruitment attempt of Dion Cele.  	Now this attempted recruitment would mean that we would have to abduct Cele from Swaziland and that here within the borders of the RSA, he would be persuaded to co-operate.  And the information which Vorster gave Taylor and me was that Cele had declared himself willing or had given an indication of willingness to come out to the informer, in other words, out of Swaziland to work with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>	Col Vorster will provide more detail to you regarding how the informer, Neville himself, came out of Swaziland.  ...(transcriber's own interpretation) It was due to his position that he identified Cele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see that there is a gap here in Exhibit D.  Could you just inform the Committee what the arrangement was and how the arrangements were launched.  You were in Durban, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, Col Taylor came to speak to us, at least he contacted me and requested my presence when Vorster came to visit him with the request that we assist in the recruitment of Cele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Colonel Taylor was Col Andy Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And he has since then passed away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Very well.  Now you had this order and what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> We began with the preparations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who is the "we"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That was Col Andy Taylor, Col Vorster, myself, Laurie Wasserman.  From Pietermaritzburg there were persons by the name of Jerry Brooks - I cannot recall his rank anymore and ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I beg your pardon.  Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> ... and then Col Taylor also called Frans Labuschagne from Middelburg, as well as a Sgt Verwey to assist, due to their knowledge of the road network in Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>	The planning was that we would enter Swaziland illegally via a border post and that we would meet the informer Neville in Manzini and that he would point out to us the college where Cele took night classes.  We did not know him physically, we just knew his name.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>	And then after the informer had lured him to a vehicle we would take him illegally over the border fence to the RSA, and for that purpose Labuschagne and Verwey would be of value to us because if we experienced a problem within the Swaziland territory according to our knowledge, they knew the dirt roads which led to the fence where we would then cross the border illegally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Very well.  And as far as you can recall, Sam du Preez was one of the members who went with you from Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Because Mr Verwey stated in his amnesty application that Mr du Preez indeed accompanied you, but you say that this is not the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, that is incorrect.  Chairperson, it then also came to be that during July 1988 we travelled to a place which belonged to the Department of Forestry and was situated between Nerston and Amsterdam, where we spent the night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just give me the name of the place again, where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> N-E-R-S-T-O-N, Nerston.  It's a border post, Chairperson and the town is Amsterdam, as in the Dutch Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What did you travel with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> We travelled a hired Volkswagen kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where was the vehicle hired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> It was hired in Durban, from Avis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And who went with you in the kombi to Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> With me in the kombi there was Laurie Wasserman, Andy Taylor and Vorster, as well as Jerry Brooks, who drove with a vehicle and Verwey and Labuschagne joined us later.  I don't know whether this was at Amsterdam at the place that belonged to the Department of Forestry or at a later point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You say that Taylor and Vorster travelled with you.  In the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, they travelled in their own vehicle.  We travelled in three vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Brooks in the one, Taylor and Vorster in the other and you and Wasserman in the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now let us go to the point where you arrived in Swaziland.  You and Wasserman then went through the border post into Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Legally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, legally.  Just to supplement that, before the night of the seizure action or the abduction we legally entered Swaziland via the Nerston border post with our passports, we met our informer at the George Hotel, he identified the college to us, he identified Dion Cele to us and according to that we could undertake planning in terms of where we would seize him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And who had to be placed where in order to undertake the reconnaissance surrounding this entire operation so that it would run safely?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> The following evening we went in three vehicles to the Nerston border post and crossed into Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you and Wasserman still in the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, Sgt Wasserman and I were in the kombi.  Sgt Verwey was in a vehicle and Col Vorster and Mr Labuschagne were together in a vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where was Col Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Col Taylor and Sgt Brooks remained behind at the Nerston border post ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can I just stop you there. I got the impression that you were already in Swaziland and you say now the following you were back in Nerston.  That's in South Africa.  So you legally entered Swaziland and did you come back again into South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Chairperson, I will explain.  I said that the entry to Swaziland did not take place upon one occasion only, the night of the abduction was preceded by a reconnaissance trip to Swaziland during which we followed the entire procedure of picking up the informer at the hotel.  He showed the college to us, he identified Dion to us and surrounding that we understood our planning for the abduction operation.  We returned to Nerston and then the following evening we re-entered Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So there were two occasions, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well this time, did you enter legally again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Legally again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You were in a kombi with Wasserman and you have already told us who manned the other two vehicles.  I think that would bring us to paragraph 4 of Exhibit D, but before we get to that, did you meet Neville again in Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, we met him again at the George Hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you pick him up there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, we picked him up and a small distance from the George Hotel, Neville then took over the driving of the kombi while Wasserman and I concealed ourselves in large cardboard boxes which had been placed in the back of the kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>	He drove to the college and parked diagonally opposite the gate.  Sgt Verwey and his vehicle stopped some distance ahead of us, and behind us were Vorster and Labuschagne.  They would be our backup should something go wrong.  The informer met Dion after he had finished his classes at the college and accompanied him to the kombi.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>	For the purpose of the abduction we damaged the left front door of the kombi so that it could not open.  We wanted him to enter the kombi by means of the sliding door.  After he had climbed into the kombi he sat down on the seat directly in front of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That would be next to the driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, directly behind the driver.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I beg your pardon, perhaps we are misunderstanding each other.  Mr Cele climbed in by the sliding door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, and sat down on the seat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Which seat are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> The kombi had double seats behind the driver's seat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So he sat in the second row of seating on that bench.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> And I just want to explain.  Because a kombi usually had double bench seating, the first seat next to the sliding door had been removed so that we had more room in the kombi.  In other words, there were two seats in the front of the kombi, one for the driver and the passenger and then one bench seat which was adjacent to the engine and adjacent to the section containing the boxes in which we were concealed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is all this detail necessary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Not really, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well you must try and control it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Very well, please proceed.  Cele then climbed into the kombi, and did you move away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, the vehicle drove away and while it was in transit, Wasserman and I seized Cele and kept him under control.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did he scream?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, he screamed and shouted.  We gagged him so that he could not make any noise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> On the way we stopped near the border post so that the driver, who was the informer, could climb out and stay in Swaziland.  I took over the driving of the kombi while Wasserman remained with Cele and we drove up to the border.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>	At some point we left the usual road and followed a dirt road, according to which we crossed the border into South Africa illegally after the fence had been pressed down to ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Please pause there.  Wasserman will tell the Committee that he hit Cele a few times with the first in order to bring him under control.  Did you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that was in the process of controlling him and making sure that he was quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, if I may interrupt.  Would you perhaps give an indication whether you would take the tea adjournment at quarter to eleven or at 11 o'clock.  I know some of the judges prefer to take it at quarter to eleven and others at 11 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well now there's no hard and fast rule about that.  I was under the impression we'd finish.  If he hasn't very much more to say on this aspect of the matter, we'll adjourn at 11 o'clock if you don't mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, he's virtually through, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a>	Now after you had left Swaziland, where did you go then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> We went back to the house belonging to Forestry in Amsterdam, where Vorster and I began to speak to Cele that night under the leadership of Taylor.  This whole exercise was aimed at winning his co-operation as an informer.  And the other reason why I was there was to correlate and confirm any information as correct, should he give any information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was there a chief interrogator of Mr Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, the interrogation was jointly undertaken by me, Taylor and Vorster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So it is actually incorrect when you say that Cele was interrogated by Taylor, he was actually interrogated by you, Taylor and Vorster?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was his attitude?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Initially Cele responded to that which was known to us, because we had to put leading questions and consequently he would be able to respond to what we wanted to know.  But I was under the impression that after he had crossed the border he would very willingly offer his services to work as an informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a>	Now during the interrogation I received the impression that he was not very favourably inclined to do so and upon occasion it was said 'This guy isn't going to work with us'.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did it become clear to you the evening after the abduction there at Amsterdam already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, one would have a feeling that when one was involved in such a seizure action and attempting to replace him into a structure, there would be feeling whether it was going to work or not.  Sometimes there would just be an immediate summation of the person's attitude, sometimes one's impression would only be garnered after a few weeks of dealing with the subject.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The fact is that he was abducted and he wasn't willing to co-operate, so what would the repercussions of that have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> We had to take him back from Amsterdam to Pietermaritzburg or to a safe place where we could work with him further.  Now he knew that Sikhakane was instrumental in his abduction, that he had in fact lured him to the point of abduction.  We could not leave him there immediately and say go back to Swaziland ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Are you referring to Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What would he then do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> He would immediately convey the identity of Neville as an informer to the ANC, and that is why it was decided to take him to Pietermaritzburg.  And the following day we then indeed transported him to Pietermaritzburg and all the members and their vehicles returned to Pietermaritzburg with the exception of Verwey and Labuschagne, who had already returned to Middelburg the previous evening after they had finished their task that we had brought them out for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where was Wasserman?  Did Wasserman return with you to Durban or did he remain on the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, Wasserman remained on the farm with the rest of the people. I brought the kombi back to Durban in order to return it to Avis, because there was a limited time for which we had hired the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Very well.  And then in paragraph 11 you say that the following day you heard that Cele had been eliminated.  Who told you this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> I'm of the opinion that it was Col Taylor who told me this, because I made enquiries regarding Cele to determine whether or not there had been any progress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  And the reason was that he had not wanted to co-operate as an informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You then say in paragraph 12, that for obvious reasons you did not make the matter known and you made yourself guilty of defeating the ends of justice.  The evidence will then be placed here before the Committee, the evidence of Vorster and Wasserman regarding what exactly took place on the farm after you had departed from there.  Perhaps I can just ask you the following ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where was this elimination of Cele, was that in Pietermaritzburg or was it still while he was still on the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, the evidence will be that it is a farm in the Elandskop area, in the district of Pietermaritzburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh, I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was used as a safehouse - to use that expression, and that as the same farm on which Ndwandwe as well as Tekere were also assassinated.  Cele of course also, but you'll obtain more detail from the other witnesses later on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Perhaps I could just ask you this.  On that evening when you came out with Cele from Swaziland and he didn't want to co-operate and you then foresaw that he could possibly be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> It wasn't specifically discussed, but I foresaw that, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And the one reason was because if you had released him he would be able to expose the identity of the informer, which then would be the end of the informer.  Was there any other reason that emerged within you indicating why nothing else could be done with him other than elimination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> What also became known to me after my first meeting with the Swaziland informer, is that he did not operate alone in Swaziland, but that there was an entire family network within Swaziland, because he lived there and that it was not only his own life but the lives of his family which would be jeopardised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And then from paragraph 13 onwards, would you just conclude.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> I cannot recall who said this to me, how he was eliminated and who precisely had eliminated him.  It wasn't necessary because I didn't ask for those details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what do you say about your conduct in the abduction as well as you emission to make the matter known?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Chairperson, I did this.  It was aimed at protecting the State and the National Party, as well as maintaining the government.  I was not benefited in any way or rewarded for the action.  I did not draw any personal advantage from this.  I did this because I believe it was right for the country and it was part of my duties.  It was necessary that if the decision was taken to eliminate Cele, this would be the right decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would you please turn to page 1 of Exhibit D.  Your application involves an abduction or illegal arrest.  That would be the chief offence, abduction or illegal arrest of Dion</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a>Cele, the transgression of border control regulations when you brought him out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> His illegal detention or depravation of his freedom, defeating the ends of justice, which you have already informed us about and any other offence or illegal deed which may emanate from evidence.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, thank you, that is the evidence-in-chief which we wish to place before you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you very much.  We'll take the adjournment at this stage and resume at a quarter past eleven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">H J P BOTHA:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have no further questions to put to Mr Botha in-chief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, no Mr Chairman, save for drawing your attention to one further aspect, and that is that in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Report, volume 3, at page 205 there is reference to this incident of Mr Dion Cele.  I just draw your attention to it.  Perhaps I can read to you quickly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'll save you the trouble.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But it does not - it's not at variance at all with the evidence which you're about to hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you very much.  Do you have any questions to put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I have no questions, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR NEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you have any questions to put on behalf of the victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I do, Mr Chair, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you please do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a>	Mr Botha, when it was reported that Cele would be willing to co-operate, were you there?  Were you present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That's correct, I was present, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Were you told on what basis he would be willing to co-operate?  Or rather just to rephrase the question, did Mr Sikhakane tell you on what basis he reached the decision that Mr Cele would be willing to co-operate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Chairperson, Col Vorster informed us that Sikhakane told him that Cele was willing to be recruited as an informer.  I was not personally informed by Mr Sikhakane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> So what you are saying in other words, is that you don't know the basis upon which Sikhakane reached the decision that Cele would be willing to co-operate.  Is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Would you know when Mr Sikhakane actually informed Mr Vorster?  In terms of time, when did he inform him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, I would not know exactly when he informed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> When were you informed that there was such a possibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> A few days before our departure for Amsterdam to execute the abduction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Was it two days, three days, a day before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> I would say it was less than a week, within a seven day period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Would you know whether the information, whatever information was given by Mr Sikhakane to Mr Vorster was verified?  About Dion Cele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, if I understand the question correctly, the information which Col Vorster had via Sikhakane, he verified it with me on the grounds of information that I had which we received from Swaziland that Cele was responsible for border work.  And we confirmed that he was responsible for border work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I think the question you're being asked is a subtly different one.  She's saying, was the information that the deceased would co-operate with you verified?  In other words, was the information Sikhakane gave you that led to the abduction of the deceased, was that information that he'd be likely to become an informer or a worker with you, was that verified?  That's what she's asking you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, that information was not verified by me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Was it verified by anyone else as far as you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Not as far as I know, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Now you've also indicated that Mr Vorster informed you or requested you to come and join them for this operation of the abduction of Mr Cele.  Do you know why specifically you were called to come and join them for this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Chairperson, I said that at that stage Col Vorster was at the Division Natal and we were the Division Port Natal and right up to that stage we had much success with out actions against terrorists in the Division Port Natal.  We had a very thorough network of informers in Swaziland.  This was the first operation for Col Vorster and Pietermaritzburg and that is why they needed our expertise in terms of what our information network was, and that is why we were asked to accompany and work with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> When you were requested to become part of the operation, what was going to be your role in the whole operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> At that stage I worked with MK Intelligence, I was responsible for the analysis of this information.  And consequently if Cele conveyed information I would be able to verify it on the basis of what was already known to us.  And in the whole process I would play a part in his abduction and it would be an active role.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You have also indicated that when you went to Swaziland you first went for the reconnaissance and then you went back to the borders.  You've also indicated that Mr - you went to a hotel where Mr Sikhakane pointed out Mr Cele.  Would I be correct to say so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No.  We found Mr Sikhakane at the George Hotel and from there we went to the college where he identified the college to us, and he met with Mr Cele that evening so we could identify Mr Cele as to what he looks like.  And that was the purpose of the reconnaissance that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do I understand that to mean that when Mr Sikhakane was talking to Cele, you watched that from a distance, or were you part of the conversation between the two of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, Chairperson, this took place over some distance.  Mr Cele attended classes at the college in Manzini and when classes ceased at approximately eight in the evening he would come out and Mr Sikhakane would meet him at the gate so that he could identify him to us.  And this was done over a distance by means of observation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Can I proceed, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a>	Before Mr Vorster told you anything about Dion Cele, as a person who was responsible for information analysis, did you know anything at all about Mr Dion Cele before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes.  I knew he was part of the MK Natal structure in Swaziland, responsible for border work.  Border work entailed that he worked in certain areas at the border, he recruited people who assisted them in the insurgence of terrorists into the country and the smuggling of weapons by means of couriers.  So his role and activities within the MK structure of the Natal machinery was known to me, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> So you wanted to recruit him, that's correct isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say it was known to you, you did not know the individual, you knew somebody by that name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> What I wanted to know is, you had indicated that you had intentions to recruit him, what were you going to use him for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> As an informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Another question with regard to that, that the family asked me to ask you is, would you have recruited him if you had not been informed that he was willing to co-operate?  Bearing in mind that you already knew about him before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> All persons were targets for recruitment by the Security Branch.  The fact that we became aware that he was an easier target is why we specifically focused on him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You have indicated that when you took him into the car, when he was taken into the kombi he screamed.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Did he say anything else besides screaming?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, asked who we were and what were we doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You've also indicated that from there you took him to Amsterdam where he was questioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And where he furnished you with some information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> What kind of information was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> It was information with regard to the structure in Swaziland, information which was known to us or which was not known to us, which I could verify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And then you said also that it became clear that he did not want to co-operate with you.  On what basis did you reach this decision?  Like I want to understand because there was information that he gave to you.  Now what made you, or what led you to believe that he's not willing to co-operate with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> The moment one would ask the person "Are you prepared to go back and receive information as to when terrorists would infiltrate?  Would you get that information for us with regard to weapons being smuggled in?"  And that is what we would want from an informer which is placed back in Swaziland.  And when these leading questions are asked with regard to that, there was a refusal and his body language indicated that he was unwilling to concede.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You've also indicated that you were not present when Mr Cele was killed, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> So you wouldn't know how he was killed would you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> At this stage Mr Chair, thank you, I have no further questions for this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a>	Mr Botha, I am not hundred percent clear with regard to the reconnaissance that you undertook.  You did not mention that in your application or in Exhibit D which is before us.  Would you not regard it as very relevant to your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes.  During consultation it was not regarded as relevant and in my evidence today I mentioned that the area was not strange and we knew what Cele looked like because he was identified do us.  And the point was Skosana was introduced to me for the first time by Vorster in Swaziland - oh, excuse me, Sikhakane.  I knew of his existence as an informer, but what he looked like and so forth was not known to me and he was only introduced to me in Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Was it discussed beforehand that you would go back and report back and then you would do the final planning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, I think Col Vorster would be able to give more evidence in detail, but I can just explain it as such.  There was no finality with regard to a precise day and date on which he would come out, that is why there was an excursion, there was an arrangement with Vorster and the informer.  He confirmed it and a final arrangement was made for the following evening, and the following evening we carried it out.  ...(transcriber's own interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thanks very much, you are excused for the time being.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
