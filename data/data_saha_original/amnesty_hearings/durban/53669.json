            "As it was explained before, that this Chesterville was a place where there were many comrades.  I can say there were ANC supporters there.  All of us, we were politically educated from a young age.  We were used to attending meetings and the young boys would be victimised or harassed by the police because of that.  That led to a situation whereby we wouldn't sleep at our homes as young boys.  I am one of those boys who did not sleep at home during those days, who couldn't sleep home.\n\tOn the 20th, I think it was between 6 and 7, I met with Russell who was my neighbour.  We used to sleep together or spend nights together.  We used to sleep at his sister-in-law's place with Stanley, because he was also in the neighbourhood there.  I cannot be sure at what time it was, I think it was before or after 10, I'm not sure, we went up to the house where we were going to sleep.  We stood at the door.  We were still smoking our cigarettes, as we did not want to do that inside the house.  As we were still smoking there at the door, we were at the road called number 15 as we were going up to number 16 road.  The coming from road 16, going to 15th road.  The house is in road 15 where we used to sleep.  If you are at road 15, 16 would be further down.  We noticed a car, as we used to take note of each and every car that would go past.  It was white E 20, if I'm not mistaken.  It was standing right at the end of the road at road number 16. That was next to a shebeen.  We asked ourselves some questions as to what was the car doing there because it had been there for some time, but we decided to go to sleep.  \n\tWhen we got into the house we went to bed.  Perhaps after an hour and a half or so there was a knock at the dining room in that house.  We could not respond because we were not the occupants of that house.  The owner of the house went to open the door.  When he opened, we saw a person who was known to us, it was Sandile who was staying at road 16.  He was with another gentleman called Ray, who was staying at road 8.  Road 8 is quite at a distance but Chesterville is such a small area, therefore we used to know one another, therefore that did not disturb us, meaning the seeing of the seeing of the ...(indistinct).\n\tSandile came to tell us that he was there to wake us up.  He said there were people who were at the ring who were looking for Charles.  Perhaps he had some idea that we can tell him about Charles' whereabouts.  We told him that we do not know where Charles sleeps.  He said the people had showed him some guns, or firearms and hand grenades,  they said they were looking for the youth of Chesterville, to help the youth as they were with another person from Chesterville, who was in exile but they did not want that person to be seen.\n\tWe woke up because we were in need of firearms in Chesterville.  Russell told them that we could not meet with the people that we did not know at the door.  He told them to meet us at Ncapeshe's shack.  When we left there it was myself, Russell and Stanley and Sandile and Ray, the people who came to wake us up.  We told them to go to those people and we told them that they would find us Ncapeshe's shack.  We got in there and we told Ncapeshe that there are people who were around.  We waited for them to come.  We couldn't trust them and we just closed the door and we were not saying anything inside the shack.  After some time we heard the footsteps and they were talking in some rather strange language.  I cannot say it was Zulu or Xhosa.  At least I know those languages, I even know the Sotho language.  That was a language that was not familiar to me.\n\tThey knocked at the door.  We kept quiet.  No-one told the other that we should keep quiet, but we just kept quiet.  They tried to knock, or they kept on knocking until such time that we realised, that we heard some footsteps, that they were rather, they were like going back to where they were coming from.  Though I cannot remember who said that the door should be opened for them, though I cannot remember who said that the door should be opened, but someone said that we should open the door.  When they came back, they came back with Sandile as well as Ray.  Two men came into the shack as well as one woman.  We were seated in such a way that we were crammed together because the shack was small.  The door of the shack was on the side and we were sitting on the other side of the door.  There was a bed and I was sitting on the bed, Ncapeshe as well, Russell as well.  Sandile and Ray came in and they stood on the other side of the shack.  \tThe people who came into the shack stood next to the door and one of them stood somewhere in the middle of the shack but not nearer to the position where we were sitting.  They introduced themselves.  There was one dark-skinned person and he said they were coming from exile, they were ANC soldiers sent to Chesterville because of the problems that were prevailing there and that there is one person in the car whom we knew, the person is from Chesterville, but we would not be allowed to see the person because we were told they were working underground.\n\tThey then started asking us questions as to what was happening at Chesterville and what problems we had.  We then explained to them what problems that we had.  Our major problem was the police, we explained and the vigilante group, the group that was called A Team, which group was assisted quite a lot by the police, that was our main problem.  They then asked us while we were there, they referred directly to Ncapeshe, because he used to be a boxer and he was wearing these boxing pants and he was naked on the other part of his body.  They then indicated to us that they were going to make arrangements for us to go to exile.  They also mentioned the death of Moses Mabida.  \n\tWe had discussed with them to such an extent that one person among them, one person who was standing at the door, unzipped his jacket and drew a firearm.  It could have been of this size.  He indicated to us that that was an AK47 and gave us a brief course on how it operates.  One person, I think it was myself, requested to have a look at this AK47 and he removed something which I think was a magazine.  He then handed it to me.  We then all came together to have a look at this AK47.  We then requested to use it, to see if it was indeed working properly and they responded by saying if we were to fire a shot, that might draw the attention of the police because there was a police camp nearby.  We accepted that.\n\tAfter discussing with them, they then agreed that they were going to fetch some firearms and ammunition which they thought we needed.  The lady then went out.  She apparently was their Commander.  They had indicated to us that she was their Commander.  They were still standing at the door and we were sitting down.  When they went out, I requested to go out to relieve myself.  They refused.  That is when we started suspecting that something was wrong.  \n\tAfter a while after the woman had left, she came back.  She just opened the door ajar and whispered to the person who was standing next to the door.  They then went out.  On moving out of the shack, gunshots were immediately fired.  Gunshots were fired to what I can estimate to have been 6 to 7 minutes.  I think it was 2 minutes, I wanted to use seconds in my estimation, but it was something that happened swiftly.  After the shots I heard footsteps.  I heard a car engine running and I heard the revving of the engine, that the car was moving at a high speed.  \n\tI shouted once I was sure that they had left.  I called out to Ray.  I think he tried to respond to my shout but something that sounded like water dropping was happening at the same time and when I shouted again, trying to establish who was still alive in the house, I was alive, but I didn't know whether I was injured or not.  What I knew was that I was not able to move.  I could only move my hands and my head.  There were people who were on top of me.",

            "Nobody responded to my shout when I called out to their names.  I then pushed the people who were lying on top of me.  I didn't know who they were because it was dark in the house.  I only realised that I could not move when I attempted to get up and walk.  I then remained there for a while and somebody responded, asking whether I was still alive and who am I and I indicated that I am Tebello, I am still alive and my whole body is burning from the bottom to the top, I cannot move and he indicated that he was thinking of going out to seek some help.  I then realised that it was Stanley because he had already identified himself.  I then requested him, that is just before he went out, people were dying and I was in the process of dying too, I requested that he takes me out of the shack and hide me among the mielie fields because these people might come back.  He did not listen to me.  When he went out of the house, he started making noise.  His explanation is that he travelled, or walked a distance from the house to the street shouting, by which time a lot of people had started gathering and he then gave them an explanation to the effect that they had now been injured.\n\tThere were people who came to the scene first.  These were not members of my family, but neighbours.  One such person was Skolo, he was a next-door neighbour.  He was a middle-aged person and Mdo as well.  When they came it was dark.  There was poor visibility and he lit some matches.  On lighting matches he exclaimed with shock and he withdrew, he went out of the house.  That's when I started realising that indeed a person is badly injured.  \n\tThe second group of people to come in were my two uncles.  They attempted to lift me up, but they realised that they could not.  They tried to put me onto a blanket then they lifted me by the blanket.  When they came, a van had already arrived, that is the van into which I was taken and they covered me with a sail, or a canvass.  Before this van left, came this police minibus.  It had doors on both sides and when these people explained, they said they had come for the injured people.  By that time I had already been taken away in that van, so they missed us.  \n\tThen I was taken to Makhote Hospital.  When I arrived at Makhote Hospital I was told that they could not help me because they didn't have certain machines, so that I had to be taken to King Edward Hospital.  There were certain whites with whom we worked at the King Edward Hospital.  These whites had come from the Black Sash.  These are the people who took me and hid me in a certain compartment, because when we arrived there we were told that the police had been there looking for us.  \n\tI refused to go to the theatre until about 2 o'clock.  My aunt arrived at 9 o'clock in the morning.  By that time I had already been informed that others with whom we were shot, had already died.  It was my aunt who convinced me to go to the theatre.\n\tI think I regained consciousness after 6 or 7 days because my family say I would stare at them when they came to visit me but I would not say a thing.   So when I regained consciousness, I inquired as to what happened.  They explained the whole story again.  I managed to have a recollection of the whole scene and I had several gun shot wounds on my body, about 9 of them, I think, such that I spent about 4 to 5 months recuperating in hospital.  \tThere was a time when I was under police guard and some police would come and take statements from me.  We had a lawyer, Mr Shezi.  He came to me.  He indicated to me that I should not give the police any statement.  If they wanted to arrest me, so be it.  I had already read in the newspapers stories to the effect that we had fired shots at the police.  The police who were guarding me spent about a month, if I'm not mistaken, after which they disappeared.  I have no reason to say I know why they disappeared.  I think what explanation I have given you here is, to my knowledge, according to what happened.",

            "Mr Chairman, I'm going to request this Hearing to believe that the, to accept that the version that has been put forward by Mr Nofomela is a full disclosure of the particular events which occurred on that particular day and that his application also complies with the Act and that he had made a full disclosure.\n\tThere is just one aspect which I want to touch on his evidence, the question of the vehicle, which Mr Nofomela says there was a vehicle and the survivor says there was no vehicle.  I just want to point out that one has to take into account the fact that the witness himself has not seen, suspected - first of all, he saw the vehicle and he suspected that that vehicle could have been used by the attackers.   When the vehicle left the scene, he heard the vehicle being started but he is not able to say conclusively that in fact the attackers were using the very same vehicle, therefore the question arises whether, under the circumstances, would it be a - would the reasonable inference be that the attackers were travelling in a vehicle under those circumstances?  \n\tThat is a question that I will just leave to the Hearing to consider, but I will also further say that if the Hearing comes to the conclusion that in fact the attackers were using the vehicle, it is my submission that it could not be said that Mr Nofomela did not make a full disclosure.  In fact he will obviously not be deliberately lying about the fact that a vehicle was used and I would then attribute, if the  Hearing comes to a conclusion that the only reasonable inference to be drawn under the circumstances is that a vehicle was used, that due to the failing recollection of the memory of Mr Nofomela.  Particularly in view of the fact that when regard is had to the evidence of Mr Nofomela and the evidence of the last witness, they are ad idem in the sense that they make sense.  According to Mr Nofomela he was told that people were going to get shot, he was not supposed to get involved and indeed, according to the survivor yes, the people were shot at and there were no - the inmates of the shack did not have any firearms or nothing, so nobody was trying to arrest them and therefore what Mr Nofomela is saying does make sense.  \n\tNow when you look at what the last witness is saying and one considers also what Mr Nofomela says Mr de Kock told him, they agree.  Mr Nofomela says: \"Mr de Kock said to me that the people are going to get shot\" and indeed according to the evidence, those people were assembled in one point and then shot at, so it does make sense.  It does make sense what Mr Nofomela is saying, it is actually the truth about what happened on this particular day.  \n\tOn the other hand when you look at the evidence which was given by Mr de Kock, Mr Radebe, Mr Vermeulen, it doesn't make sense at all.  It doesn't make sense at all.  For instance, Mr de Kock talks about the fact that two Security or three Security Police officers were killed in Durban and that's why they had to go to Durban.  If you look at, I think it's Exhibit B, the one of, which was an application for a firearm, an AK47 of Mr Nortje, according to that exhibit there was just to be an infiltration in Natal, in Durban.  The note was compiled, the note was made in a hurry on the 3rd of June but they went to Durban on the 20th.  Why do you go to the police headquarters to seek for a permission to carry a firearm on the 3rd of June, in a hurry, without typing the document and then you leave on the 20th?  You have more than 15 days you know to type a proper document and get permission.  So that doesn't make sense.  \n\tNow Durban was a flesh point, it was a boiling point, police officers were killed, etc, etc, etc.  Now they come to Durban, according to their version and they attempt infiltration.  They get shot at and they never even attempt to arrest the survivors or to check what happened and they never pursued the case of attempted murder against the police officers.  Now what is very strange again is a whole contingent of Vlakplaas went to Durban.  Immediately after the shooting they go back to Vlakplaas.  Almost 40 members of Vlakplaas went back to Vlakplaas.  Now, the killing of the police officer was not yet resolved.  Now why would they go back to Vlakplaas, because the murder is still unresolved, but they went back to Vlakplaas.  It is quite clear, as Mr Nofomela says, that they went to Durban precisely to go and shoot at those people.  They shot the people and then they went back to Vlakplaas because the mission was accomplished.  \n\tIt is my submission that my client's version of events as to what happened on this particular day, is the one that has to be believed, because it also is being corroborated by what the survivor said on this particular day and the survivor has nothing, the survivor and the applicant are people who are not, you know, they don't have the same interest and therefore there is no reason why the survivor cannot be believed and there is no reason why Mr Nofomela should not be believed and I therefore request that Mr Nofomela's application  for amnesty be granted in this particular instance.",

Now it was the whole contingent which went to go and investigate, but according to his own testimony the same time also, they had no such skills to investigate you know ordinary murders, because that was an ordinary murder of police officers, they just happened to be Security Police officers and in the evidence that has been led today, there is absolutely no shred of evidence which shows that the killing of those two or three police officers was pursued in Durban.  There is absolutely no evidence that indicates that anybody tried to find out who the killers were.  Radebe talks about Municipal police and a Municipal Police officer and a police officer, but there is no evidence that anybody tried to investigate any murder in Durban.  There is absolutely no evidence.  The only evidence before you Mr Chairman is that they went to Durban, they went to Chesterville, they shot at people and that they went back.

In other words, you know, there is no evidence as to what they did  and anyway about 40 of them had already left, so the question arises, why did they leave for Pretoria because they had a specific task to come to Durban to undertake. Now they left for Pretoria in large numbers, so that should be, one is - it will be fair and reasonable to draw a conclusion that they had already accomplished their mission because if they didn't, as Mr de Kock says, they  will never ...(indistinct) at doing anything.  Now if Chesterville was a boiling point and they haven't accomplished their mission and it is Vlakplaas, you know they never hesitate to do anything, they are trained, now they should have remained there to resolve their problem.  They never did so and we are talking about a unit which is specifically trained to deal with opponents in a very vicious way.  So if they go back, then my conclusion is that they had accomplished what they went for to do.\n\tI will also further say that that document which was handed in relating to the fact that, which was Nortje applying for a firearm, that document is very suspect.

            "Yes, Mr Chairman, the significance is that my client says that he was, firstly he was told by Mr de Kock that people were going to get shot at and also that Mr de Kock was at the bridge.  The significance lies in the fact that, should the evidence point that Mr de Kock was at the bridge, in fact then that will actually mean that Mr de Kock also knew about what was going on and what was going to happen in Chesterville and that is the significance, as far as I see it and when looking at that particular point, I think one should also consider the background of Mr de Kock himself, his position, he was a Commander, he had a lot of experience, he was involved in a lot of illegal activities at that time and now, if you look at his background, you look at the number of people who went to Durban and you look at the fact that he was in Durban and Chesterville was a boiling point, the comrades were in control of Chesterville, as he put it, it was a liberated area,  when you look at that particular situation and you look at the evidence of Mr de Kock that he was asleep, it doesn't make sense.  It doesn't make sense.  Here was a man who was in charge, who was a Commander, he was very dedicated to his cause and the place is in turmoil, the comrades are in control, but yet he goes to sleep.  He doesn't even know when people go into Chesterville, he doesn't know it.  When an AK47 is given, he hasn't seen it and if you look at his background and what he was doing at the time, it is my submission that it is not really consistent with what he was doing at that time as a Commander at Vlakplaas, it is not consistent.",

If you look at Mr Vermeulen himself, you look at his evidence in order to see whether you can believe his version that Mr Nofomela was not at the bridge.  If you look at Mr Vermeulen's version, Mr Vermeulen, with due respect to him, he says you know they went to, they drove to the bridge and at the bridge they were waiting at the bridge and upon being asked he says, no they wanted to assist the people who had gone into Chesterville by vehicle but according to Mr Vermeulen, he did not know where they had gone into, he did not know how far they had gone into, they didn't even know Chesterville. So according to his own testimony, Mr Vermeulen, you know he wouldn't have been able to assist them because he didn't know where they had gone to and his own testimony, he doesn't - it is not clear, there is no reason whatsoever why they were at the bridge, because they couldn't offer assistance to those guys.

Therefore, it is my submission that when a lot of Security Police officers are at a bridge, surely a person of Mr Vermeulen's position should know why he was there.  He should know.  If he doesn't know why he was waiting there, then there is something wrong with his evidence.  That is Mr Vermeulen.\n\tMr Radebe is the same position.  He says they went there - firstly, Mr Radebe, he says they went there to infiltrate but he doesn't know, after infiltrating, what they were supposed to do.  You see, you must remember, the Hearing should consider the fact that they went to the UDF activists to infiltrate them, according to Mr Radebe and if you take the background that the comrades were in control, police officers were killed etc, now they would infiltrate the UDF.  After infiltrating them, what then?  What they were supposed to do?  Are we to believe that a specialised unit from Vlakplaas will send people into Chesterville to infiltrate the UDF without telling them what they were supposed to do after succeeding, succeeding to infiltrate them?  Are you infiltrating and do nothing?  It's a boiling point.  You have taken the whole contingent to Durban, now you instruct people to infiltrate but you don't tell them what to do.

His own version again about the fact that, I know he's not an applicant but his own version about the fact that he was acting in self-defence, also it doesn't make any sense.

            "My client has complied to the statutory requirements of the Act as stipulated in Section 20(2)(a) and 20(2)(f) Act 34 of 1995 and has at all times acted in the course of his duties and in the execution of his orders from Mr de Kock.\n\tIf we look at what the order had been to the Vlakplaas members, they went there to infiltrate and to gather information and then to do further planning.  I have quoted in the cross-examination, the point of view of Gen Coetzee on page 10 of Exhibit C of the aims of Vlakplaas and this, just to use this as a starting point, Gen Coetzee says in paragraph 2.2, Gen Coetzee's point of view, as can be drawn from this is that it was countering terrorism and this was to identify so-called terrorists and then after this they would be arrested and then they would be convinced to co-operate as askaris with the members.  In these cases where there had been people who had been followed up, if you can remember then I quoted a part where they say that the specific Commanders of the unit then had to take responsibility for this.  I would then ask that after this information had been gathered, then a return would be made.  It would be conveyed to the Commanders and then the Commanders would make a decision in the Security Branch, what the further steps would be.   The reason why I'm saying this Mr Chairperson, is that I am getting the impression that this shooting had been a sporadic incident that happened.  Something must have happened.  \n\tIf we look at this and you have heard many of the hearings of de Kock, this is not the normal covert operation.  We don't have a weapon that has been drawn from Vlakplaas's stores where there is no record of which had then afterwards been used in a covert operation or afterwards been destroyed or burned.  This is not the normal action of the Vlakplaas unit.  \n\tNortje in this case, he goes and he draws on a written document and we can have all sorts of suspicions about this document, Chairperson, but it is very clear that it is aimed at Section C1 Security Headquarters and we do not know what the roles of Brig Schoon in the past had been and it surprises me that Mr Wagener is not present in this aspect today, but he did approve it, he approves it.  We draw a weapon, we give a reason for wanting this weapon, we say that we want to use this weapon for a period, 30 June 86 or 3 June to 30 June 86 and this weapon is necessary to secure the credibility of this team, to ensure the infiltration of this team with a group of ANC terrorists\nin Port Natal and this is, according to my experience of the few hearings that I've done, not the normal action, if it was not an overt operation.  There was nothing covert about this operation and now they come down and this incident takes place.\n\tMy application is to a very lesser degree.  I realise this, but in the light of the evidence of Mr Nofomela where he makes very serious allegations, we had to get involved.  Let's look at the evidence of Mr Nofomela and then we see all the answers that I had taken down in English.  He said:\n\"I do not remember, if my memory serves me well, could have been, not sure if de Kock was, cannot remember if Vermeulen was in the car.\"\nYou see and I'm not criticising him in this respect, it did happen a long time ago, but the fact is that his evidence is full of unsureties.  If we look, then most of his assumptions are based on hearsay.  He says de Kock had dealt out the weapons and later on he says Nortje had dealt out the weapons and later in cross-examination he says but they were both there when these weapons had been handed out and these are important aspects and what had been said at those scenes would have been very important evidence.  He remembers Steve Bosch, Frank McCarter, but he cannot identify Vermeulen.  He can admit that it is a possibility.  In his application he gives evidence on page 85 that AK47s had been given and when I questioned him about this, he tried to rectify this and he said well actually it was only one AK.  One does not make such a plural mistake if you had been present when these weapons had been handed out Chairperson.  I then put it to him if he wants to correct the version in his application and he said yes he would like to do that, it was actually just one AK47.  \n\tWhen my learned colleague, Mr Schalk Hugo, cross-examined Mr Nofomela, then it became very clear that a vendetta is being held by Mr Nofomela against Mr de Kock and you  asked the legal representative what reason would Nofomela have to imply de Kock and there you have the answer, Chairperson.  There is a vendetta that has come from the Court case, there is evidence before you that de Kock had received a message when he was in the Adriaan Vlok Prison, with the following idea and this is an indication Chairperson, that it's not necessarily just from Nofomela's side, it's from both of them because I understand that the same message had been sent to him for the murder on Lourens, this man on the farm and de Kock said: \"You just have to take the pain\" and then between these two there had been a vendetta and there is a vendetta which would definitely give an indication or give a reason why he would like to imply de Kock and if we ask, what is the easiest way to get de Kock in trouble?  If you say that you had been on a scene where de Kock gave orders, then de Kock has problems, that's logical. So you are implying yourself, in other words.",

            "Mr Chairperson, apart from this aspect that he now places himself on the scene where the weapons had been handed out, he transports these alleged murderers to the scene and he played a very actual role according to his evidence, with all respect and if you look at page 29 to Willem Albertus Nortje's statement, then you see that he says that the following members departed to Chesterville to go and do duty there and then he mentions 10 names and it's a complete list.  What could the reason be why at this stage Nofomela's name had not been mentioned?  He says:  \"We departed, the driver ...\"  He could say \"We departed, the driver of the vehicle was Nofomela\" and there was no reason at all to leave out his name and this appears in all the documents that had been handed in at the inquest and this really puts a question mark over his evidence for me.  And if we look at the evidence of Mr Nofomela, I have problems with his political motive.  I think members of the Committee specifically asked about this, but he associated himself almost with the aims of Vlakplaas.  We could maybe try and infer this as a political motive.\n\tImportant, Mr Nofomela was not present when the orders had been given that the comrades had to be killed.  We have evidence that he said:\n\"Those people will be shot.\"\nThis could be interpreted in many different ways.  It could be that the askaris could be shot or it could be that the white members could be shot or it could be that other people could be shot.  It does not necessarily mean that enemies would be shot.  It could be, as it was put, but this is an inference, that he possibly wanted to protect Nofomela.  He did not, he shouldn't be at a scene where a possible shooting could take place.  They go into a flash point in Chesterville where there are serious unrest with active ANC activists and comrades and A Teams and it is logical that it possibly could have been said, but it does not mean that he had knowledge that steps would be taken to eliminate people in a kind of an ambush.  \n\tIf we then - Nofomela cannot remember what Radebe had said.  He said Radebe just said that it would appear to me as if the mission was everything but successful.  It is not the normal type of action to leave survivors.   From the hearings that I had seen, it is definitely not the case. We have the perfect example with the Nelspruit murders where Tiso had been the spanner in the works, to put it this way and he was murdered.  Maybe a miracle that Mr Mbatha's sitting here today.  He was shot 9 times and apparently this was the intention to kill him.  You shoot a person 9 times if you want to kill someone.  There are other people who have been killed 20 times, the other people 15 times and it appears to be a very serious attack.  It was undoubtedly a very serious attack, we cannot doubt this, but something happened to trigger this off.  There is a very interesting allegation that, I don't think you missed it, that one of the people's machine guns had gone off too quickly and this appears in one of the statements and it wasn't brought up by my learned colleague.  It's a point.  Something happened that then triggered off this incident.  If it had been a shot from inside the so-called shack, or an uzi that had been triggered off too quickly, but something happened that then led to an incident that was not planned.",

It was two incidents and then later on he acknowledged that it could have been the same evening.  An aspect that had been important that the Assessor Adv de Jager had asked about, is that according to Mr Nofomela they walked into the township and I think it is rather clear, even from Stanley Dlamini's statement and the evidence of Mr Mbatha, that a vehicle had been on the scene.",

Then Mr Nofomela on page 85 of his application says\n\"The plan was that the Squad member who were to meet with the UDF people, would kill them.\"\nThe plan.  This is a fact.  He says it's a plan, but he was not present when the orders had been given by de Kock.  Then how would he know about a plan?  How can he make such a statement?  If he had said, as the Committee had noticed, that something might have been said in the vehicle on the way from Pretoria, then this could possibly have solved it.  he says:\n\"The plan was that...\"\nand then he continues.  He cannot make such a statement, he was not present.  He does not know what the instructions had been and the instructions of de Kock could have been infiltrate, get information and report back.  He can't say what the plan was.  It then bothered me and the Committee also asked questions: didn't he talk to the other askaris afterwards, didn't he gain information that would then tell him what exactly had happened?

            "Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, first with regard to the application by Nofomela, it is apparent and even from his evidence, both under cross\nexamination and his evidence in chief, even though the point was not canvassed in much detail by his legal representative that there was no political motive.  In fact under cross-examination it would appear that Nofomela, he himself never had any political motive, nor was he even aware or sure of the political motive of his masters, that there was any.   All that one can submit, Mr Chairman, is that he just followed orders and on those basis Mr Chairman, his application ought to fail.\n\tHowever, Mr Chairman, the significance of his application serves to highlight one point, that the Chesterville Incident, with regard to that incident and how it came about, there were more forces at play and that there was planning, there was conspiracy.  Infiltration, as one understands it, whether in the manner it was being used or applied or practised at the time, or if one follows the convention or the dictionary meaning of the word infiltration, it is not something that can be done within the span of a short space of time and something which can just be delegated to some junior officers or to some junior members of the operation.  It is something which is normally well-planned, with such precision.  For Mr Radebe to come and say their instructions were to go, infiltrate, look for information about Charles, if you find any, well and good, if you find no co-operation, kidnap them, come back with them.  That Mr Chairman I submit doesn't make sense. \n\t Mr Radebe in his statement which he made subsequent to the event, he says they came after he had decided that the people in the room must be arrested on whatever basis, however questionable that basis might be.  They took up positions around the shack.  What for, it is not clear and even the whole question of arrest, it was canvassed thoroughly during Mr Radebe's cross-examination and some questions came from the Chairman and the Panel, that how did they go about arresting you know, when they asked other members of the group to go out?  \n\tMy submission in that regard, Mr Chairman, is that this was part of a plan, they took position because they intended to shoot and calling out the other members was that it's now time.  The whole plan of going to Chesterville was to, I submit, assemble as much comrades as you can, wherever you can and then shoot.  This was very much well-planned, use and AK to elicit their co-operation and their trust and then once they trust you, then you can shoot them.  And it is not something that Sgt Radebe and the askaris that were in his company, with respect, Mr Radebe's competence and capability, it is something that I submit it was not within his domain to plan and do, but somebody in the higher echelons of the C10 Vlakplaas Unit had to do.  \n\tMr Eugene de Kock was the Commander of the C10 Vlakplaas Unit which came down from Durban to Pretoria, yet according to Mr Vermeulen, when this aspect was discussed of going to Chesterville or of rather conducting the search of the killers of Security Policemen at the initial briefing the Commander was not there.  This whole thing of going to Chesterville, it would appear that it was just an initiative by Willie Nortje.  The taking of the AK47 which was under the control of Commander de Kock and who had requested it, somewhere at some point in time he never knew where it was, he never knew it was controlled, Willie Nortje could take it and go wherever he wanted to go.  I submit even some junior member of the Unit could have taken it to Umlazi or to kwaMashu if Sgt Vermeulen was to be believed.  \n\tAlso and finally Mr Chairman, Mr Vermeulen applies for amnesty for unlawful possession of a firearm, an AK47.  His evidence under cross-examination reveals that both in fact and in law, he never possessed any firearm.  Under cross-examination he told this Hearing that in fact he did not even know that there was even a firearm in the vehicle he was driving from Pretoria to Durban and he only saw it, or alternatively became aware of it when Willie Nortje handed it over to Sgt Radebe, somewhere in Chesterville.",

            "That is so and even at that time, he did not even touch it.  Mr Chairman, I thought that maybe had he told these two legal representatives, they would surely have advised him, but you have committed no offence here, there is no point for you to apply any amnesty because as I indicated, even if he was charged, I do not believe that any competent or right-minded prosecutor will take this thing anywhere, even if is taken anywhere, it was not contested in court.\n\tI submit Mr Chairman, that his only purpose to bring an application here, it was merely to cover up and dispel any fear that there was any conspiracy from the higher-ups, in the higher echelon's of the C10 Vlakplaas unit.  His application with respect Mr Chairman, is nothing else but a farce.  One cannot understand why Nofomela would just out of the blue, out of whatever vendetta, however that vendetta might be defined, would place himself in the scene, implicate himself on a number of other charges, purely because he wants to get back at de Kock.  I submit, Mr Chairman, that there are far more serious issues, or there are far more many ways even, Nofomela said it before with regard to Mr de Kock, that he was going to take this incident as part of the thing.  The idea that de Kock was sleeping when this whole thing happened, that he never knew anything about it, I submit, Mr Chairman just doesn't make sense.  \n\tFinally Mr Chairman, shortly after the incident in Chesterville, the shooting, they left.  That whole crew left Durban, they abandoned the main purpose why they came down here i.e. to search for the killers of the Security Policemen, because of the incidence in Chesterville, they just abandoned it and went back.  The people who came to conduct such a search, by their own admission, they had no investigative skills.  These were murder cases, whether of Security policemen or Municipality policemen, they were murder cases, local policemen ought to have been involved, local C I D's ought to have been involved, but they weren't part of it.  I submit a specialised unit was sent to Chesterville to carry out a certain .... (intervention) mission i.e. to kill comrades, i.e. to kill the people that had been assembled at that point in time.  I submit, Mr Chairman that, as I said earlier on, that application by Mr Nofomela in particular, is nothing else but a farce, this is not a Commission of Inquiry, one may add, however Mr Nofomela's application highlights the fact that there were more other forces at play, de Kock and the others were involved.

He took the risk that he's now going to lie and say that de Kock was on the scene, well knowing or taking the risk that de Kock is able to bring witnesses like it's happened here, to indicate that clearly he was elsewhere, he was somewhere else.",

I wish to state at the outset that my submissions to a large extent accord with that of my learned colleague Mr Shezi and I won't repeat those.\n\tIt is my respectful submission that the probabilities in this case are overwhelmingly in favour of the fact that there was in fact a conspiracy to murder.  My submission is, after having listened to the evidence of Mr Mbatha, that the primary intended target of this operation was indeed Mr Charles Ngcobo.  We have the affidavit of Mr Hamilton, who states specifically that Mr Nortje and company requested information on Charles himself and not the other way round.  We have Mr Mbatha saying that the physical features of Charles and that of one of the deceased was very similar.  It appears to me a reasonable inference that the group that had gone to Chesterville were falsely under the impression they'd in fact found the intended target and then proceeded as instructed.\n\tMy difficulty ...(intervention).",

He acted purely under instructions, his evidence to us was clear.  As early as 1984 he had difficulties with the role and function of Vlakplaas, the only reason he stayed there was to a large extent that he didn't have any other options, that he stayed there out of pure duress.\n\tSo my submission is, purely on that ground, Mr Nofomela's application should fail.  \n\tRegarding the application of Mr Vermeulen, I think Mr Shezi had addressed you quite thoroughly and competently on that score and I will not repeat those submissions.

I just want the Hearing to note that the evidence of Mr Nofomela is to the effect that he never heard Mr de Kock instructing the unit members to go and shoot the people.  His evidence on the contrary is that Mr de Kock told him that people were going to get shot, so one should make a clear distinction about that.\n\tThe second point is the political objective.  It is my submission that the act which was committed by Mr Nofomela is an act which is associated with a political objective and that he knew that the UDF activists were going to be killed and he associated himself with that particular act and therefore he qualifies in terms of the Act. \n\tThe last one is the vendetta.  Mr Chairman, I would like the Hearing to consider this in analysing the evidence.  firstly the Hearing to determine whether Mr Nofomela does have a vendetta against Mr de Kock and if that is the position, then the Hearing should continue further and find out from the evidence itself whether the vendetta that Mr Nofomela had against Mr de Kock led to Mr Nofomela actually saying that, implicating Mr de Kock because you can have a vendetta, a grudge against a person, but it does not necessarily mean that each and everything that you are saying is not true.  One cannot say, \"Once a liar, always a liar\", therefore, if the Commission finds that Mr Nofomela does have a vendetta against Mr de Kock, the Committee also has to further on, to determine whether in fact this vendetta led to Mr Nofomela saying what he said and I submit that when the Hearing does so, if it finds that indeed his vendetta led to him saying what he has testified about,  then we would be left with the improbable version of Vermeulen, Radebe and Mr de Kock himself.",
