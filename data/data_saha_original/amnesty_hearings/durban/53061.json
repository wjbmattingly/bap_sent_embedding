As far as I understand, they have to show that their actions were politically motivated firstly.\n\tI submit that it is not disputed that they were ANC members, UDF members initially.  It is also not disputed that during the course of their membership as UDF members, they were recruited to become the members of the SDU's.\n\tI do concede that their recruitment might have been done in an amateurish manner, but nevertheless, I respectfully submit that they were members of the Self Defence Unit.\n\tThe story that Mr Mkhize was participating with the kwaZulu police cannot be regarded as being improbable.  I respectfully submit that the TRC hearings are full of that history of the kwaZulu police collaborating with Inkatha and I respectfully submit that what the applicants have said, should be taken as the truth.\n\tRegarding disclosure, I submit that in so far as relevant facts are concerned, they have fully disclosed their activities in the killing of the deceased.  They have done so in great detail.  Although I concede that there is an aspect by the last applicant, Mr Mbutho which seems to be unsatisfactorily, that he didn't indicate who the people he got the ammunition from, were.\n\tBut I submit that compared to the overall picture of what he has given to the members of the Committee, he has made a full disclosure and his failure to give the names of the people that gave him firearms, could be attributed to a lapse of memory.\n\tThis incident happened in 1992 and this man has been in jail, he has been thinking about some other things and I respectfully urge that his lapse on that score, should not be held against him.\n\tThe evidence has been led and the members of the Committee are apprised of the evidence, and I respectfully submit that to run through all the evidence would be a waste of time, unless there are specific questions which the Committee wishes me to respond to, I cannot take my argument further than this, thank you.",

Firstly I would like to put it on record that I don't have any objections, to them being granted amnesty.\n\tSecondly, I think there is a very thin line between two situations here.  One scenario is that it is possible that the applicants saw, or it is possible that the deceased had attacked the applicants before, who were ANC and the deceased was IFP.\n\tThe deceased came to visit his mum, the applicants saw him, they decided to kill him.  It might have been a revenge.  That is one scenario.\n\tThe second scenario is of course that from the judgement, even from the evidence of some witnesses, I am reading at page 107 of our bundle, where one of the State witnesses did make an indication that the deceased was an IFP member, it would appear that the situation really was one where there was political conflict in the area between the IFP and ANC at Macubeni.\n\tThis was not an unusual situation, especially in kwaZulu Natal, where you would find that the ANC would attack the IFP and the IFP would attack the ANC.  Basically my submission is that I wouldn't have any objections should the Committee decide anyhow, I would abide.",
