<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning everybody.  Mr Dehal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.   Mr Chairperson, Mr Webster is not here today.  I do not seek any further indulgence as far as he is concerned.  He is not an applicant, he had received a notice to avail himself of these proceedings as an implicated party but perhaps I should just place on record that I did confer directly with him on the telephone and he asked me to record in the unlikely event of him not being present here today or during these proceedings that he supports all the applicants in their application for amnesty, that to the extent I discussed the evidence of the first few applicants and indeed those that I and Mr Kooverjee represent with him, he aligns himself with those versions, does not take issue with them and as I said supports their applications.  Thank you.  He apologies also for not being present, as I said earlier he is unemployed, he doesn't have funds to be present here.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Dehal.  Does that then conclude all the evidence that is going to be led on behalf of all the applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr Chairperson, insofar as I am concerned, yes that is so.  I believe that Ms Kooverjee would probably want to address you on two remaining witnesses, but very briefly, on the same lines that I did insofar as Gordon Webster is concerned.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Kooverjee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MS KOOVERJEE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Insofar as Janet Apelgren whom I represent, she has confirmed that she is unavailable to attend these proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We heard that she's in Victoria, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MS KOOVERJEE:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairperson.  She aligns herself with whatever has been - the evidence which has been given at this hearing and she supports the application for applicants' amnesty.  The same with Mr Du Preez, he has also been subpoenaed as a witness, he is unavailable to attend due to lack of funds and ill health.  He also supports the evidence that has been led before this Committee and supports the application for amnesty by the applicants.  That is all, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Ms Kooverjee.  Mr Richard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Sorry Mr Chairperson, before Mr Richard begins perhaps I hand a return Exhibit D which has so long with me, I apologise.  I've also made an additional copy.  I also have made copies of the documents I undertake to make which deals with an excerpt from Volume 4, chapter 7 of the TRC report, an extract of which Ms Narkedien read out.  May I hand these copies in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Certainly, thank you Mr Dehal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, just for the record on behalf of the first to the fourth applicants, we do not intend tendering any further evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Chairperson, with regard to the attack on Mrs Klein's house, it's appropriate to record that she's satisfied with the disclosures made and does not oppose the amnesty application in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>	Then to turn to other matters, Mr Webster has chosen not to come and give evidence before the Committee and I do not believe that my learned colleague's statement takes the matter any further, it's certainly not evidence before the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, no we know that Mr Richard and we won't be regarding any of the statements made as to what people's attitudes are who haven't been here as being evidence of any note.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Then I proceed to call Ms Burton to make an unsworn statement.  She is one of the victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Ms Burton, could you please give us your full names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS BURTON:</span> My name is Mrs Claire Evelyn Burton.   Evelyn</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS BURTON READS STATEMENT:</span> That's right, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>	I would like to give my sincere thanks to the Truth Commission for affording me the long awaited opportunity to hear these proceedings and to be able to respond.  On the 14th June 1986 my family suffered the loss of my sister, Julie van der Linde.  She was a young 28 year old woman at the time of her death.  She was not a soldier or a police person.  She was a civilian.  She was murdered by Robert McBride in the Why Not/Magoo's bar bomb attack. </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>	Ten months later, my family buried my father.  He was unable to deal with the shock and horror of his baby daughter's death.  Aboobaker Ismail was the commanding officer of the terrorist operatives, a commander who says he assumes responsibility for all the activities that his operatives carried out but he did not know that the Why Not bar was the target of attack on the 14th June 1986.  He has indicated that he would have chosen the Natal Command Military Base on the Marine Parade.  In fact, as the commanding officer, he knew hardly anything about everything.  His terrorist army seldom reported back to him, he gave commands that were not carried out, he relied on newspaper reports pasted in a scrapbook to keep himself updated with all the movements of his commandos.  He handed weapons and kilograms of explosives to 19, 20 and 21 years old boys, boys whose training consisted of a few weeks in some cases a few days and then turned them loose on society, all of them to do as they pleased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>	Aboobaker Ismail says that he was fighting a war.  I have sat here and heard Robert McBride with arrogance and pride boast of all the crimes he committed during this period and that he chose the Why Not/Magoo's bar because he'd been told that this bar was frequented by military and police personnel.  I do not believe him.  I heard his story of how he once went to the Magoo's bar with the intention of joining the people inside but he said that he was refused entry because the bar was too full but he could clearly see that this was not the case.  I believe that this was the reason that he chose the Magoo's bar on the 14th June 1986, he chose this bar to vent his own personal anger and not because he was ordered to do so.  I do not believe that this was an ANC organised operation.  Robert McBride is asking the Truth and Reconciliation Committee to dish amnesty onto a silver platter and hand it to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>	Recent news reports have reported his involvement in a Cape Town brawl and that he spent six months in a jail outside of South Africa.  I have not read in the newspapers that Robert McBride speaks out against rape, I have not heard in the news that Robert McBride is going to establish a special armed unit to free this country of violence and crime.  What has Robert McBride done to earn amnesty?  What has Robert McBride done to deserve amnesty?  Robert McBride is a despicable man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>	I respectfully appeal to the Truth Commission to deny amnesty to Robert McBride and all who were involved in the bombing of the Why Not/Magoo's bar.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mrs Burton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Mrs Burton, is there anything else you would like to add?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS BURTON:</span> That's all I'd like to add, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  The next person who would like to come forward is Sharon Welgemoed.  Ms Welgemoed is prepared to take the oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Welgemoed, is it correct that you wish to give evidence, take the oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS WELGEMOED:</span> I'm going to read out a statement but I am prepared to take the oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I don't know if Mr Richard explained the difference between merely making a statement or taking the oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS WELGEMOED:</span> Yes he has.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because if you take the oath then I will then be giving opportunity to the representatives to put questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS WELGEMOED:</span> That's fine.  That's acceptable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's your choice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS WELGEMOED:</span> No, that's acceptable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you wish to give evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MS WELGEMOED:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your full names are Sharon Welgemoed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">SHARON PATRICIA WELGEMOED:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Sorry Mr Chairperson, may I come in at this, I apologise for the interjection.  I have a concern insofar as the applicants Mr Kooverjee and I represent and Mr Berger seems to align himself with my concerns insofar as the first witness Mr Richard represents is concerned and the nature, quality of the submission she has made in the format that she has made them.  I do understand that there is no evidential value to her statement made in the nature it was made but in addition there are many aspects in that statement that cast ...(indistinct) on Mr McBride, his credibility, on aspects outside the ambit of this application on things that attack his credibility, his character etc, for example the Cape Town brawl, the Mozambique issue.  I am seeking clarity for I do not know what my status is, what my applicant's rights are insofar as that statement is concerned.  I think leaving it as it is without expressing our views especially with the public recording offered and the wide publicity that this is going to receive I have deep concerns and it counters reconciliation, especially in the spirit with which it was read out.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I align myself with Mr Dehal's comments in particular we understand from the Committee's point of view that a statement made not under oath doesn't carry any evidentiary value, we understand that completely and we have no problem with that, the problem of course is that these proceedings are being recorded by the public media and will receive as Mr Dehal correctly points out, wise publicity and it's that publicity that would be uncontradicted and uncountered and we have a serious problem with that as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Richard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you Chair.  When consulting with victims I was at pains to explain to them that it is their prerogative and privilege to say what they feel and what they have on their hearts and minds to say.  For a witness to be censured or to be restrained or to be confined to what they wish to say I believe would be contrary to the rights of a victim in a particular situation.  I don't think Ms Burton transgressed any rule or practice in the Commission, it's what she wanted to say and she has had her right to say it and it stands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you want to say anything Mr Prior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> To the extent that the statement was not under oath, obviously the evidential weight in these proceedings is minimal.  There is precedent for the procedure or for the fact that unsworn statements have been read out throughout the history of the Amnesty Committee, such practice has been followed and allowed in many amnesty applications to the extent that the applicant feels that he is now prejudiced by that, unfortunately the process doesn't cater for that save that if there is a feeling that the public only have heard one side of the story obviously I think that could be addressed via the media or through the media.  Unfortunately as Mr Dehal has pointed out there is very little that this Committee can in fact do to assist the applicant in respect of the objection that he makes.  The statement is now on record, it's been attended at an open hearing, I don't have any practical solution other than if the applicant feels aggrieved by that he could also maybe talk to it and get equal time to talk to it via the representatives of the broadcasting media.  Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll just take a five minute break so that we can just discuss this issue before ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, might I just add before we take the adjournment that I'm not sure if Mr Prior is correct in saying that there is provision made in the Act for an unsworn statement.  I refer the Committee to Section 19.4(b) of the Act which says that if an application has not been dealt with in terms of (3), the Committee shall conduct a hearing as contemplated in chapter 6 and shall, subject to the provisions of Section 33, (a) says "notify the victim" and (b) says "inform the persons referred to in paragraph (a) which includes a victim of their right to be present at the hearing and to testify, adduce evidence and submit any article to be taken into consideration.  It speaks about testifying and adducing evidence which I would submit would mean evidence under oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> But may I reply?  Submitting any article, article is very widely defined, I'm simply saying that in the history of this process there are many, many amnesty hearings where such unsworn statements were tendered and received by the various Committees.  If this Committee requires examples of those ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We know that that happens at a large number of these hearings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> That's basically what I was alluding to, that a practise has developed, been allowed to develop and I think it's not out of line of (4)(b) in terms of the definition of article.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> You see, Mr Prior, that is true but I think it's probably the first time that certain comments were made out of context and irrelevant comments to the application, attacking peoples person, integrity and that seems to be the nub of the problem.  Had the comments been confined to the facts of the application, I don't suppose anybody could have any problems with it and that seems to be to me the sore point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll take a short adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Perhaps Mr Chairperson, I should just mention in all fairness before the adjournment, I'm sorry to interject, in the prudence and the exercise of our discretion, in the exercise of our professional will, Ms Kooverjee and I, together with Mr McBride, Robert and Derrick, had considered it appropriate not to have his statement handed in inasmuch as he does not have anything inflammatory to prevent a situation like this arising and I think the other side was aware of this and the possibility of Derrick McBride's statement possibly being one that would take that line, called in advance for copies of statements and we considered it wise not to read them, not to hand them in.  Now we've not had the opportunity of seeing these statements in advance, we heard afresh, it goes to the public media, it is now flashing all over the world on TVs, Mr McBride is attacked, is defamed, how do we address this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> May I object at that stage?  The statement that Mr McBride was attacked and defamed I believe is an inflammatory statement in its own right.  Ms Burton did not say anything that was not within her rights to say.  She said, as this tribunal allows, what is on her mind.  She has every right to have her point of view and to put it on record and I believe her right in the situation should be respected.  It is her opinion and her feeling which she gave her statement regarding and I do not believe that it's appropriate to put her under attack for making use of what is her right.  As it pleases you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Chairperson, not only was Mr McBride defamed but so was Mr Ismail defamed.  To say that he was a commander of terrorists, that he was a terrorist commander who put young boys into the public domain so that they could commit terrorist acts, that is nothing but defamatory of Mr Ismail and the African National Congress and Chairperson, to make those statements without giving us notice of what the statements are going to contain in a public domain which is where those statements are irrelevant for purposes of this hearing can only be to make them maliciously and then obviously then litigation will follow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes thank you, we'll take a break now and we'll let you know when we'll reconvene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  We've lost quite a lot of time today, but I believe I've been informed that the time hasn't been wasted, parties have been talking to each other and preparing various statements.  We are at the situation now where Mrs Burton has made a statement, there were certain objections made to it by the applicants, Mr McBride and Mr Ismail and in the interim period from when we adjourned until now we, the Committee, have that opportunity from time to time to speak with all the representatives together and a request was made by Messrs Dehal and Berger to be able to submit a statement, an unsworn statement, in response to the statement of Mrs Burton.  This is an unusual step but we are also in an unusual situation here, first time that something like this has occurred and we as a Panel decided that it would be appropriate for such statements to be made.  Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Ismail has prepared a typed statement I believe, everyone including members of the Committee have copies of the statement and if that is so I would ask Mr Ismail to read his statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ismail, you may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR ISMAIL READS STATEMENT:</span> Mr Chairperson and Honourable Members of the Committee, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was brought into being by the ANC led government.  It is called upon to discover the truth about our past and to facilitate reconciliation.  It is an unique process in the world.  More unique because for the first time we have a situation where the oppressed talk about reconciliation rather than calling for Nuremberg Trials.  The history of the struggle is well-documented.  The ANC has made extensive submissions to the TRC on this.  Ms Burton has sought to vilify the entire basis of the struggle for freedom.  We reject her charges of terrorist operatives and terrorist army with contempt.  The policies of the ANC over decades of armed struggle ensured that our country did not descend into a racial war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>	Two weeks ago, we reminded the Committee of blacks stretching out the hand of friendship to whites with whites generally spurning the gesture.  Every day of this hearing has been spent with victims in an attempt to bring about reconciliation.  Reconciliation, however, is not a one way process and Ms Burton's remarks show that reconciliation is a road little travelled.  Ms Burton seems to forget that the majority of victims of apartheid were blacks and civilians, whether in Sharpeville, Langa or Uitenhage, black civilians died.  Nobody batted an eyelid because they were black.  The truth is the blacks have not been seen as people.  Nothing is said about the loss of black lives.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>	In 1976 when the so-called well-trained and well-armed police and soldiers of the apartheid regime went into the townships they killed innocent children in Soweto and other parts of the country.  When they killed those children they were protecting Afrikaans and Afrikanerdom and white privilege as fascists.  Those Security Forces consisted largely of 17 and 18 year old white conscripts, that the white society gave to the system to defend white power and privilege.  We recognised the rights of victims to oppose applications for amnesty and to speak their minds.  However, the statement made by Ms Burton this morning is inadmissible and unacceptable and against the spirit of this process.  We ask the Honourable Committee to make a ruling to this effect.  The ANC and the applicants reserve their right to institute legal proceedings in as far as Ms Burton's statement goes outside and beyond the law.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Dehal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Sorry, on the same terms, Mr McBride has prepared a statement that he wishes to read and I believe copies have been handed to all the members present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE READS STATEMENT:</span> Thank you Sir, Mr Chairperson and Members of the Committee.  Firstly, in spite of Mrs Burton's rantings and ravings which she has a right to, I still want to continue to participate in this reconciliation process.  However, she will not be able to deny that there have been millions of victims as a result of the conflict of the past.  The cause of this conflict was apartheid which benefited white people like Mrs Burton at the expense my subjugation.  I fought against a subjugation with utmost dedication and for this I am proud.  No amount of rantings and ravings will make me change my belief that it was correct to fight against a crime against humanity.  Mrs Burton has no copyright on being a victim or of having suffering during the conflict of the past.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>	It is no exaggeration that millions have suffered or died on the subcontinent as a result of apartheid trying to perpetuate itself.  Apartheid as a system attacked black South Africans as a whole.  In fact it attacked them because they were black.  All the applicants in this hearing are victims of the apartheid system. </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>	Mrs Burton has referred to newspaper reports of me.  In the two incidents she mentions I have been completely exonerated.  Furthermore, these two incidents have nothing to do with this hearing and are irrelevant.  Mrs Burton begins her statement by thanking the Truth Commission.  I wish to remind her that it is the same ANC that she refers to as terrorists that drove the process which culminated in the establishment of this Truth Commission.  Ironically, I as a legislator of the new democratic government voted for the establishment of this Act which gave birth to the Truth Commission.  This Act ultimately gave rise to this forum in this hearing for Mrs Burton.  She has now abused this opportunity.  I trust that her comments will not be taken into account in deciding my amnesty application.  I nevertheless reiterate that I'm in favour of reconciliation and I am willing to actively contribute towards achieving this.  My rights arising from Mrs Burton's statement remain reserved.  Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There's just one point which I must make reference to before we adjourn.  Mr Berger raised or questioned the right of the victim to make an unsworn statement such as the statement made by Mrs Burton.  Our view as a Panel is that the Act does not exclude the right of the victim to make an unsworn statement.  Mr Berger referred us to Section 19.4 of the Act which states inter alia that the victim shall have the right to testify at a hearing and that testify implies giving evidence.  However, it has been practise from the very start of these procedure for victims to make statements, unsworn statements at hearings and this has happened on many, many occasions at many other hearings and also our view is that Section 19.4 does not although it only refers to a victim testifying does not exclude the lesser right to make an unsworn statement particularly when one takes into account the provisions of Section 11 of the Act, that's the Truth and Reconciliation Act, so-called Truth and Reconciliation Act which provides inter alia that victims shall be given the right to present his or her views and submissions.  So we are satisfied that the giving of unsworn statements is not either illegal or improper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD REPLIES:</span> Thank you Chair.  May I make a reply?  It seems to be forgotten that Ms Burton is indeed herself a victim of a gross human rights violation, the death of her sister.  While it might be that reference to post 1986 events did not take the matter further, they must seen in the context.  She asks the question has he done anything further to earn reconciliation and amnesty.  The matter that we debate today is one particular event.  A bombing of The Parade Hotel on the Durban beach front.  As a result of this morning's interchanges and indeed I'm sure I'll be asked the same questions again later, I had been approached to answer the questions, is it not the right of some and I certainly stress the word "some", not all victims, to make the submission that they see this particular event and I leave reference to other events out of my address now, as a bombing which was firstly a terrorist attack, which was secondly on civilians, thirdly possibly racist in nature, committed with a purpose and intent of spreading terror amongst the civilian population with the object of destroying their morale.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>	The Committee has referred to Section 11 of the Act creating the Commission and I would point out that the Act specifically provides that victims shall be treated with compassion and respect for their dignity, shall be treated equally without discrimination of any kind, including race, colour, gender, etc. and then particularly the Commission and this Committee is enjoined to ensure that victims have the right to have their views and submissions presented and considered at appropriate stages of the enquiry and in this regard I specifically refer to a Section 11(d)(ii).  It is my submission that Ms Burton did nothing more than what was her rights and that the reaction that we have been subjected to since she made her statement has been utilised for mere propaganda purposes.  Thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Berger do you wish to say something?  I would just like to say that when I made the reference to the making of unsworn statements please don't interpret it as being the ruling requested for by Mr Ismail in his statement, I was merely saying that in our view the reception of unsworn statements is allowed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.  Might I just respond very briefly, I never understood that this was going to be an opportunity for my learned friend to argue before the Panel.  I thought that we were going to save argument until all the evidence has been led.  I will reserve most of my comments then for argument but I wish to point out to my learned friend that not once did he put to a single applicant that the attack on the Why Not bar was a terrorist attack or that it was a racist attack.  He never put that to a single witness and it's not open for him to argue that now or at any point in the future.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes well we can deal with these questions in argument and also the question of the ruling asked for, I think we can also deal with in the argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Sorry Mr Chairperson, lest it be said that Mr McBride's silence caused him to align himself to one or the other side, I align myself totally to what my colleague, Mr Berger, has said and may I just add that in the time that was given us for which I am thankful, for which we are all thankful, Mr Richard, I, Mr Prior and all the attorneys had lengthy discussions about the proposed statements.  Never once were we alerted, forewarned about the possibility that Mr Richard was going to adopt this line. I did not prepare argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes we can deal with it later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, before we proceed and I'm mindful of the Committee's ruling about being able to receive unsworn statements, I take it that we're all and perhaps just for clarity purposes, we're all ad idem that those statements have no evidential value whatsoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes with regard to the unsworn statements given by victims, not only in this matter in any hearing, as I've said we consider that to be one of the rights of the victim or indeed an implicated person if such a person would desire to put in an unsworn statement.  However, such statements do not carry evidentiary value for the simple reason that they are unsworn and the maker of the statement is not subjected to cross-examination or any other form of testing and that is in accordance with the general principles of the law of evidence and certainly it's no exception in these proceedings and also it must be made abundantly clear that the Commission cannot tell any victim or implicated person what to say as pointed out in Section 11 the Act provides that a victim can come forward and express his or her views.  Those views obviously will not be agreed with by everybody who hears them and maybe controversial and we also know that sometimes there's a lot of anger and there might be a controversy in the views expressed but however it must be made clear as well that when such statements are made it is expected that the statements be confined to matters relevant to the subject matter or the incidents of the hearing and also that the statements made in such a fashion also taking into the account the rights of others and are within the confines of the law.  We as a Committee approach these hearings in a completely and utterly unbiased fashion.  We know we are implored by the Act to treat the victims with compassion and respect which we do and are fully aware of that.  We also are fully aware of the rights of applicants.  We come into these hearings cold as it were, receive evidence, listen to the evidence, listen to the arguments and submissions of legal representatives and apply the evidence that is relevant to the criteria in the Act and  then arrive at a decision.  That is our function, that is why it's sometimes quite distressing when we get conflict in these hearings because we are of the view that these hearings should be carried out with dignity and decorum and I'm not saying that there hasn't been, that this has been undignified and with no decorum but that is what we aspire to.  We will now proceed with the rest of the matters.  Is it Ms of Mrs Welgemoed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> At this stage Chair, with your permission, I would like to change the order of my witnesses for the reason that I think the other alternative witness that I can call now will take us further quicker.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Prior, did you want to say anything or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairperson, save to say that time spent this morning up until the resumption was fruitfully spent.  All parties concerned were negotiating with each other and all problems that seem to be there have been properly addressed and have been addressed properly and are acceptable in the circumstances.  May I just make one point, that it seems to -it's encouraging to state that by dialogue and by communicating parties with divergent interests may come closer together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I appreciate the efforts made by all concerned for smoothing things over and doing their best to smooth things over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>	Ms Welgemoed, you did take the oath but we will as indicated by Mr Richard perhaps hear you later.  He wishes to change the order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  I call Mr Jeffers, he is prepared to be sworn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">JONATHAN JOSEPH JEFFERS:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR RICHARD:</span> Mr Jeffers, where did you live in 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I was staying in Queen Mary Avenue at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> In which City is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And for how long had you been resident in Durban before that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> From 1980.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now is it correct that you knew the Parade Hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And how often did you visit the Parade Hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> In around 14th June over the past I'd say six months to a year at least once a week.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now could you describe what the Parade Hotel consisted of?  Were there residential rooms, hotel rooms, places of entertainment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes there were, there were residential rooms upstairs and as you went in on your left the Why Not bar, on the right hand side the Magoo's bar and also further toward the back of the building you had Garfunkel's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now what was Garfunkel's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> It was a restaurant, entertainment centre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And what happened in Garfunkel's?  What distinguished it from the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> There were tables and set menus that you could order meals from time to time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And then ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it a restaurant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You'd go there for dinner or lunch and then you order food.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Onto which street did the restaurant, Garfunkel's, face?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Well it wasn't the Marine Parade, it was the street going up alongside the hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> In other words the street running from east to west?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now after Garfunkel's to the east I understand you had the Why Not establishment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now what was particular about the Why Not as an establishment, what distinguished it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> It was like a - I'd call it like a stand up bar, there were a few tables but at the time it was like - the Why Not bar and the Magoo's bar they were sort of the in place to go, everyone was there, if you wanted to see some of your friends you would meet there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> We'll come to that point.  Now we're talking about the Why Not bar, you're saying it was a stand up bar, in other words what I understand from what you say is that were places to stand and drink as opposed to places to sit and eat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, before you proceed Mr Richard?  Mr Jeffers, you said that in the year prior to 14th June 1986 you went to the Parade Hotel about once a week.  What did you go there for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> To meet friends in the evenings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you used to go to Garfunkel's or the Why Not or Magoo's or all of them or did you go there for breakfast or did you have drinks in the evenings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> No, generally if I went in the evening or Saturday afternoons or in the evenings you could attend each venue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You could move from one to the other without paying a covert charge or anything like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> No covert charge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now which day of the week did you prefer, was the week or the weekend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Generally the weekends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now we have established what the Why Not was, now what was particular about Magoo's, what distinguished it from the Why Not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> The Magoo's generally had live music, a band playing there Friday nights, Saturday nights.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now earlier you said something about its popularity, how would you describe its particular reputation during 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Well generally in 1986, 1984, 1986, all clubs, one club would suddenly become very popular over a couple of months and then stay that way and some wouldn't, people wouldn't attend them so much and move on to other places like the Cattleman for instance but at that time Magoo's bar and Why Not bar was a place where I'd meet my friends</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now as a result of being a frequent visitor to both Magoo's and Why Not, did you become familiar with other patrons of the establishments?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now from what walks of life did they come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> From all walks of life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you make friends with people there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now did the people who patronised the Magoo's as opposed to the Why Not sections of the Parade Hotel, differ in any way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Well in a material way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Yes, was it a different group of people or was there anything that would distinguish them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes there was, Magoo's seemed to be a bit younger and there was always live music and people dancing and bobbing up and down and it seemed to be a lot more packed and if you found it difficult to get into Magoo's you'd retreat sort of to the Why Not bar, generally could get in there and have a drink.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now would you say that your familiarity with the patrons of the establishment would have enabled you to know what their occupations during work hours was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> The friends that I had I knew what kind of work they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Were any of them soldiers, policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Mr Jeffers when you went there once a week was it always the same people there?  You see I can understand, why I'm asking the question if you belonged to a sports club and you go to a clubhouse, golf club or bowling club, one will normally meet the same people there because they are members but was this a public place, there was a membership because you did use the word club earlier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> No, no membership.  You could walk off the street and everybody could and go in and have a drink or meet people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, so what was your impression, was it a floating clientele, change in clientele or was it always regulars?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> There were a few regulars at the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, few regulars and then other people that would pop in, maybe residents in the hotel, tourists, whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> As in regulars I'd say that people that were there basically every evening to have a couple of drinks.  A couple of guys that I know that were car salesmen and things like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes thank you.  Mr Richard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> My question was, did you get to know the regular patrons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Just one or two of the people, the regular patrons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now if the establishment had become the regular so to speak watering hole of persons from either Natal Command or from the C R Swart Police barracks some distance away would you have been aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I'm sure at that time I would have been aware of it, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Now how far away ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Mr Jeffers, why would you have become aware of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Well because the few times that I went there kind of thing it was a - all the people you could see, I could see a person that was from military background.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Are you talking about uniform or other references, other modes of reference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I never heard that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> I say do you say that you'd be able to see they were of military background or whatever because of expecting them to be clad in a particular uniform or were there other ways of establishing that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I'm not sure of any other ways of establishing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> So do I understand you correctly then that you didn't see anybody there clad in uniform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Generally no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now was it your habit to indulge in idle conversation with anyone who might have wanted to speak to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> That's the way I am now as well, yes I think it would be like that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now from your last answer I take it to mean that you did not go there to particularly socialise with a particular group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Jeffers, we're talking now about the Why Not, was that the case you went rather than Magoo's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> It was either or.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What has been saying to us now in response to Mr Richard's question are applicable to both those establishments, Magoo's and ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> They are applicable to both, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> In fact in what criteria would you choose which side to go once you walked in the entrance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Depending on how you're feeling at the time, Magoo's was always very packed, generally very packed.  Sometimes you'd want to squeeze through the people and get into the bar at Magoo's, sometimes you felt it's not worth the hassle, turn left and go into the Why Not bar and get a beer faster than you could of if you turned right into the Magoo's bar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now did you know anything of who occupied the hotel rooms on other floors of the building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Not to my knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now let's talk about the age groups of the patrons, was there any difference in the age grouping of people who would go into either one or other side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I think the younger age group tended to go right or to Magoo's.  Well it's hard to say, both sides but as again, if Magoo's had filled up before anyone could get there then we'd turn left and went into the Why Not bar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now what was the general age grouping of the people who congregated in the Parade Hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I'd say 18 to mid 30's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  Now on a Friday night what would the attendance at the hotel be?  Busy or quiet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was the 14th June a Saturday night?  Why are we therefore interested in Friday nights Mr Richard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> On a weekend night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Generally at that time it was well patronaged on Friday and Saturday night and Saturday afternoon as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when you came from where you lived to the hotel how would you normally travel, would you come by car, bus or walk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Well on that particular night I was staying nearby and I walked, walked at the back of the Edward Hotel up left into the Why Not bar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And what was the condition of the traffic in the Marine Parade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Marine Parade at that time was generally always busy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What time would that have been Mr Jeffers, when you walked there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Plus minus 9 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Indeed if you had a choice between walking and talking a car which would you prefer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> It depends where I was living at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It depends, he wouldn't walk in kilometres if he lived around the corner he'd walk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was parking a problem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Parking was basically a problem, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now if on a Saturday night between eight and half past nine you walked up to the hotel, what would you see, would you see evidence of it being active or quiet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> In the vicinity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> In the area in the Marine Parade?  There was always people walking all over the place and cars up and down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Would there be other pedestrians around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And on the night in question, that's the Saturday 14 June 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes there were people around and traffic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now how full was it that night when you arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Perhaps you could be a bit more specific, if you deal with a particular bar you're dealing with Garfunkel's as well and the hotel rooms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Mr Jeffers, what time did you arrive that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Plus minus 9 o'clock and I'd say it's about 18 percent full as far as I can recollect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And were you people that you knew then inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now what did you to do once you entered, what bar did you go into?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I went into the Why Not Bar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Why did you choose that bar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Because generally that bar was the easiest place to get service quicker, the bar lay out, it was easier to get a beer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now after you entered the Why Not section how long were you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I was there until the explosion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> How long was that about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Plus minus 40 minutes as far as I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now during that 40 minutes do you remember what you were doing, who you were talking to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> The last thing I remember was holding a beer and speaking to a friend of mine, David Fletcher and then all I felt was a force, then the lights went out and I went over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Were you injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What were your injuries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> My face was - I had injuries from glass to my face, chest and arms and I had to have an operation on my hand here as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now were there any people in uniform in the pub that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Not that I recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you go into Magoo's section that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I don't think I had the chance to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR RICHARD</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Richard.  Mr Berger, do you have any questions you would like to put to Mr Jeffers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER:</span> A few questions, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>	Mr Jeffers, you say that you lived in Durban since 1980.  Where did you live before that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I spent plus minus 9 years in Australia but prior to that from the 60's our family moved to Durban in 1961 for the second time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> From where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> From England.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then you left South Africa when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> In 1970.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I left South Africa to go surfing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In Australia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes and not to do my military training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you were opposed to serving in the South African Military.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I preferred surfing as doing military training, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well I'm sure most people would but my question was more pointed than that.  Did you leave South Africa for political reasons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Well at the time I was about 18 years of age so it's hard for me to say at the time I was a political objector but now I think down the line we didn't want - none of our family, there was five boys in my family, none of us really wanted to do military training for some reason or the other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Mr Jeffers, did you say you originally came from England?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you a South African citizen, were you liable for conscription?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> At that time yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So would it be correct to say that you left South Africa to avoid military service?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Because you were opposed to serving in the South African Military?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I can't question at this - well at that time I wasn't sure because none of my friends that I grew up with ever wanted to go to the army.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Would it be correct to say that you opposed apartheid and that was the reason you didn't want to serve in the military?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I've never agreed with apartheid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No?  Would it be correct to say that at that time you opposed apartheid and that was why you didn't want to serve in the military?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I can't - see I was 18 years of age at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes can I just ask the audience please to be tolerant and give the witness a chance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I can't, I'm not sure, I can't honestly answer that question.  So I was opposed - I know I didn't want to do the military training and then for 10 years I spent overseas surfing in Australia, I wasn't into - didn't know much about politics at all at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> All I'm really asking, Mr Jeffers, is did you recognise at the time when you were 18 years old that there was an unjust system operating in South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the option open to you was to leave the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I can't answer that question, I've only realised once I was overseas what was happening in my life through talking with foreigners and that kind of thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But are you saying that one of the reasons why you left was because you didn't want to go into the army?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But the main at that time for you, correct me if I'm wrong, was the lure of the waves in Australia, surfing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why did you come back to South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I came back in '73 for one year and then I went back to England until 1980.  I came back because my family were here in Durban and I actually came back with a return ticket back to Australia and stayed on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So would it be correct to summarise it as follows, when you left the country at the age of 18 you soon realised being outside of the country what an unjust system there was in South Africa, you returned to South Africa in 1980 realising there was an unjust system and you stayed here until 1986 and afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> No, in 1971 I came back to South Africa for another year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> And in 1973 I went back to Australia until 1980.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You returned to South Africa in 1980 fully aware then of the unjust system that was operating here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I knew there was an unjust system.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you elected to remain here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> That wasn't sort of my choice at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you aware on the night of the bomb that a State of Emergency had been declared two days before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I wasn't aware that there was a State of Emergency two days before but I knew that there were state of emergencies occurring on and off in Durban, that I know for a fact because I was working at the Chamberlain Road when there was a State of Emergency when four explosions - I was working that night and four explosions went off at a substation, I was right next to it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What work were you doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I was production foreman for Toyota.  It was then I think called metalling at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you knew about the State of Emergency in the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> In which year?  On the night in question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> 1985 and 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The night in question is your answer, on the night in question.  We've heard evidence Mr Jeffers that a State of Emergency, national State of Emergency was declared on the 12th June 1986 which was two days prior to the explosion and the question being asked by Mr Berger is when you were at Magoo's that night were you aware of the fact that there was in fact a State of Emergency?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Not that I recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you weren't aware of what was happening in the country outside of your circle in Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I knew that there was something going on because there were bombs going off all around the place at the time, on and off but I wasn't actually, I didn't completely know what was going on other than there was some conflict going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Are you serious, Mr Jeffers, that you didn't know what the nature of the conflict in South Africa was in 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Could you repeat that question again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Are you seriously stating that you did not know what the nature of the conflict was in South Africa in 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> 1986?  Ja, I'm sure I wasn't too fully aware of what was going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think Mr Berger's asking you whether you knew of all the details of the conflict that was taking place, he is asking you a broader question.  Did you know the nature of the conflict, South Africa was a country in conflict in 1986 and were you aware of the nature of why it was in conflict?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I wasn't fully aware of the conflict.  Well when I think now that there were a few months prior to that - I must have known that there was some kind of conflict going on but putting it down to who was fighting who at the time, I wasn't too aware of that no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So there were bombs going off and you living here in Durban didn't really know who was fighting who and why the bombs were going off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Only until it happened to me at Why Not bar afterwards did I realise what was really going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Did you not realise when it went off at Chamberlain Road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> When the Chamberlain Road one went off I remember reading in the paper the next day, there was an article that big saying four explosions were heard as far down as Toti and that, that's all I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Well fine, that may be so, I'm just asking didn't you realise what's happening in South Africa then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Not a hundred percent, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm sorry Mr Jeffers ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> I'm sorry, at that time you said you had just come back from overseas and that is where you - but I mean when you were overseas you said it was then that you realised what was happening in South Africa, that it was an unjust system.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I didn't realise there was a war going on, I realised that was a, you know, an unjust system.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Oh.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you.  So ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Mr Jeffers, did you not during that period look at TV or read the newspapers or were you living in recluse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> During which period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, basically the whole of the '80's.  People were dying, people were being necklaced, bombs were going off, states of emergency were being declared.  Were you unaware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Well through my work colleagues I was aware of necklacing and internal conflicts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Now are you unable to tell us what you thought the nature of this conflict in this country was?  Let me help you, wasn't it based on apartheid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes it was based on apartheid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> We'd got what you called apartheid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> It was based on apartheid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you know that in 1986, June of 1986 that the struggle in South Africa centred around apartheid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I was aware of that yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that was why bombs were going off, did you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I knew bombs were going off but if you're asking me if I knew it was the ANC coming around and putting bombs, I wasn't too sure about that, no.  I knew that there was a conflict going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Alright, now that you've established that, why a short while ago when I asked you whether you knew what the nature of the conflict was in South Africa in 1986, did you say you didn't know what the nature of the conflict was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I wasn't sure if you were meaning the immediate, talking about the bombings and that.  I've always known that there's been apartheid and the problems of apartheid in South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But it hasn't really bothered you, has it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> How can you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, you weren't concerned as to what was - I'm putting to you or let me ask you, were you concerned with what was happening in South Africa from 1980 through to 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Well from 1980 to 1983 I think I worked for nine months between those three years and I had very little contact with - I was on the beach.  From 1983 I started working for the Toyota group which was a different - November '83, then I started becoming more conscientiously aware, working with my work colleagues on the floor day and night, what was going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what did you discover was going on from 1983 onwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> That there was a lot of internal conflict besides the apartheid problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that there was a struggle for liberation going on in the country, did you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Not too clearly no, I knew there was a conflict going on but I didn't realise that it was so close onto the doorstep, that immediate until the Chamberlain Road, twice our company was effected through the Chamberlain Road substation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you know in 1986 that black South Africans were denied the right to vote?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> In 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes and had been ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That they were denied the vote in 1986 but that during that period they had no right to vote, they didn't have the franchise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I think I was aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You think you were aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I'm trying to recall back, in 1986 I had my own conflicts as well, family life.  Ja, there must have - I'm actually not sure that they were denied the right to vote in 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think it was ambiguous.  The question you put was "did you know that in 1986 the black Africans were denied the right to vote" and I think it's being interpreted that that only started in 1986.  I think if you could just rephrase it Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you know that in 1980, let's start in 1980, the only South Africans who had the right to vote and this is a situation which had been in the country for decades, centuries, was white South Africans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes I was aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And did you know that in 1983 the government then introduced a tricameral parliament, did you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I only started learning about tricameral in a  passage here the other day.  Hey listen, I'm not into politics, I've never really been into politics so I don't know - you know if you want honest answers I'm going to try my best to give you honest answers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, I think we needn't cross-examine him about his political knowledge, he has given the evidence that he was in the bar when it exploded, he hasn't come here saying that he was fully aware of the politics of the country etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I take the point.  Mr Jeffers, the only point I want to make is that it appears and correct me if I'm wrong, it appears that your world revolved around surfing and going to the bar and going to work and you weren't concerned with anything outside of that, would that be fair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> No, not totally fair because quite a few of my work colleagues used to come home with me, spend time with me prior to 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you frequent other bars besides the Why Not and Magoo's bar in 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So would it be correct to say that you didn't only go to a bar once a week, you went to several bars during the course of any week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> No, that would not be correct to say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At the time when you were frequenting the Magoo's bar and the Why Not bar, was that the only bar that you were frequenting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> On weekends, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And during the week you would frequent other bars?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> During the week I wouldn't frequent other bars.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Okay.  Now you say that you had a couple of friends that also used to meet at the Why Not bar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> That's generally where I would find my friends, at the Why Not bar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So the situation is you would go to the bar and more often than not there would be people there who you knew?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You didn't say make the arrangement of the group of you saying look, we'll meet at 8 o'clock at the Why Not or Magoo's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And if you could, could you estimate the size of your circle of friends who would frequent the Why Not bar or the Magoo's bar at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Well generally I knew a lot of people as acquaintances but friends, one Saturday the one lot of friends would be there, the next Saturday or Friday night a different lot of friends would be there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> And in total, what did that total?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Total?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> How many friends would that be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> At one given time at one night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> All your friends whenever you got there, you would sit around and drink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> There would be about five, six of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you know or do you know Dennis Eaby?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Spell that surname please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Eaby - E-A-B-Y.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I can't recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you know or do you know Paula Harvey?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I think I only met her in the hospital, I didn't know her beforehand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you know Michael Blair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> The name rings a bell, I might have known - I knew a couple of Michaels, I don't know surnames even today, I don't remember surnames very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Do you remember the names of your friends?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Those six people that you said formed a circle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> At given times, five, six people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Any of these names one of those friends?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Which names?   David Fletcher was a friend of mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Like Michael Blair and Dennis Eady, you've mentioned Dave Fletcher.  When you say you would go there and meet friends, were these people that you initially met at the Why Not, started chatting and got to know each other as one of the regulars and they were regulars, you used to talk to each other?  Or when you say you were friends would you invite them around to your house for dinner or they invite you for dinner or you go elsewhere together beyond the environs of the Why Not or were they strictly speaking just people you would meet at the Why Not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> A lot of the friends that frequented the place were friends of mine for quite a few years before and I'd always hoped to see them there whatever the case was.  Some were acquaintances that I'd met there before and just general.  I'm a friendly person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say that your circle was about five or six people wide at any given point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> When you mentioned circle before I thought you meant when you went in and sat down with people or there would be five, six people standing that you talk to as friends, that generally was the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, I'm talking about ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Close associate friends?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, if you had to extract all the people that you were friendly with, who would go to the Why Not bar on any particular weekend, how many people would form part of that group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I'm not sure I understand your question, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Say you went to the bar on a Saturday night and there were three people that you knew and then you went there the next Saturday night and there were another two people and you went there a week later and there were three other people, if we extracted all of those people we might find that in total there were six people, you know, in the total group of people whom you knew, what figure would you put it at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> There were some nights that I went there that I knew many people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No I think what he means is in total, all your experiences going to the Why Not bar, how many other people would you say that you would regard as friends went during your whole period that you went there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> The whole?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you might only see six at a time or five at a time but if they were all there together, how many would be there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Many, many, many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well this is what Mr Berger wants to know, any sort of ball park figure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Oh, maybe 80 people over the period I was going there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Eighty or eighteen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Eighty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 80?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Eighty, more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And these are people who were not your friends but also associates, people that you bumped into at the bar and then you struck up a meaningless conversation with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> No, a lot of them were friends, genuine friends from the old years that I'd see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Lifesavers, surfing, talking friends, work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Okay.  Let's move to the night of the attack.  You said that the Magoo's bar was so full, correct me if I'm wrong, so full that you went into Why Not because it was easier to get a beer there, would that be right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I think I said that it was about 80 percent full and to go into the Why Not was a lot easier, less hassle to get in and just get a beer.  I did mention I walked there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Approximately how many people would you say were in Magoo's, Why Not, together that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Both combined?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I'd say - it's hard to say, could have been plus minus 200 people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And of the plus minus 200 people how many of them did you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> As I said when I walked in and turned left and walked into the Why Not bar and struck up conversation with a friend of mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You didn't go into Magoo's to see if you knew anybody there or not prior to going into the Why Not that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> You didn't have to because when you walked in the entrance, as you walked in it was jam packed by the stairs that go upstairs and that so I just knew by looking like that, go left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You went in, you went into the Why Not and then ordered a beer and starting drinking, chatting with this friend of yours, Dennis Fletcher?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> That is correct, Dave Fletcher.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it Dave?  I think that the question of whether how many of his friends were there when he said in his estimate there were 200 might be a bit, I think it's a bit unfair because he didn't do the rounds in Magoo's bar to see who he knew or didn't know.  How many people were in the Why Not would you estimate, that section you know, the Why Not when you went in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> It's very hard to give an estimate but I know it was full because when you walked into the Why Not bar it was full then, it was full.  It was fairly full.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I haven't been there Mr Jeffers but when you say it's full what are you talking about, 30 people or more, less?  50?  I've got no idea of the bar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> It could have been more than seventy people I'd say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In the Why Not itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> It could have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Would I be correct to say that the only person whom you saw that night whom you recognised that night was Mr Fletcher?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Fairly correct, I can't remember meeting anyone else, so I'd go along with that basically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And since that night have you ascertained whether any of your friends were present either in Magoo's or in Why Not at the time of the blast besides Mr Fletcher?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes there was a guy called Carl Haddon, Helen who was the barlady, Helen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, anyone else who was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> The barlady Helen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, besides Helen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Besides Helen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He mentioned Carl Hannon, is it Hannon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Haddon I think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Haddon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Anyone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> There were two other guys that - no, I can't remember their names.  That's all I know at this point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So would it be fair to say that there were just under 200 people approximately there in the Why Not and Magoo's bars that night whom you did not know at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I did not go into the Magoo Bar that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well since then, it's thirteen years ago, since then no one has come to you to say, to discuss that they were also in the bar that night?  Either of the bars?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I sure Mr Jeffers that if you had friends who were also in the bar on that night when the explosion took place and tore the place apart that you would have known whether they were there because that's the sort of thing you would talk about, surely?  Later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Ja, over the years I've learnt to - I've come across people that were going there or in there, that kind of thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now what Mr Berger is trying to establish is from all your discussion afterwards and I'm sure it must have been a huge topic of discussion, a bomb in your local drinking place would have obviously have been discussed a lot after the event by the people who were regulars at that bar.  Now from those later discussions do you have any idea as to how many of your friends were present, present in either of those bars at the time of the explosion or can't you say?  You've mentioned about four here, Carl Haddon, the barlady Helen and two other people, would there be any more that you know of that were there who you would say were your friends or acquaintances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> There were a couple more but they could have been more of acquaintances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When you speak of a couple more, how many would that be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Well I know a couple is two, I'd say about three or four.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Mr Jeffers, of all those who were not your acquaintances who patronised either of those bars, are you able to say what their occupations were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> No, I'm unable to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So Mr Jeffers, for all you know there could have been a whole host of Security personnel in the bar that night and you wouldn't have known it, aren't I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I'm not sure that you could be correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well you testified to the Committee that the only way in which you could have identified a security person, Security Force person, would have been if that person was in uniform, that's what you said to the Committee, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> That's what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You also testified that you don't recall anyone in uniform that night, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What I'm putting to you is for all you know there could have been a huge concentration of Security Force personnel, not in uniform, in the bar that night and you wouldn't have known about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> On that particular night?  I probably wouldn't have known about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BERGER</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Berger.  Mr Dehal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a>	Mr Jeffers, did you ever participate in any State President's Fund that was then set up shortly after the Why Not bar bomb for a claim for monies from them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And did you receive any benefits?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I think it was one thousand and forty rand or one thousand and thirty eight, something like that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> But no more than two thousand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said it's just over a thousand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you.  Do you mind looking at the list of witnesses in bundle A1.  I presume your attorney, Mr Richards, may have it.  If he doesn't I'm prepared to show you my copy, page 3 and 4 which is a list of the victims.</p>

<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr Jeffers, do you mind going quickly through that list, you know your name well, you can identify your name, can you tell us where on that list your name features?  There are a list of 74 persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does the name feature, Mr Dehal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I do not see it.</p>

<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It appears that the names of the deceased persons are on the right hand side column.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you.  I think two, three and four are the list of the deceased and their next-of-kin alongside of that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Do you oppose the application for amnesty of Mr McBride and Mr Ismail?</p>

<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Is it not correct that during your reconciliation with Mr McBride and Mr Ismail you felt satisfied that they have made full disclosure, that you're happy having shaken their hands, having met with them, having discussed with them their sorrow for the incidents, etc?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And during these discussions you told them, in particular Mr McBride, that you were a surfer, you had been to Australia, you left this country so as to not participate in the army, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> That is correct.  May I please add something here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I was informed that what took place upstairs there was in total confidence and that nothing here would be spoken about until I was ready to carry on further with this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, but I decided not to object.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well Mr Dehal knows about that, I don't know if you want to ask further questions which - I don't know if what Mr Jeffers is saying whether he's against answering him but if you are certainly feel free to say so Mr Jeffers, but I think it would be in confidence then keep it at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I would ask that the confidence be respected?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I think that's not unreasonable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Sorry, will you bear with me, Mr Chair, please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a>Thank you Chair, I'm indebted to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a>	Mr Jeffers, do you know the Dunnottar Boys, a group of boys who ride motorbikes and who frequented the Why Not, the Why Not bar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I knew there was two brothers that had a keen interest in motorbikes and repairing bikes and actually racing bikes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Are these the two brothers that were SADF pilots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> No, I don't know.  I just knew of them and here of talking.  I'm not sure if they are twins or two young guys or just one year apart in age.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Well what did these two boys or men that you talk about do as an occupation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I think the one guy was a fitter and turner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> You're not sure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I'm not too sure, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And the other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I wouldn't like to speculate.  I just know their interest was in motorbikes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But did you know a group of people that went to the bar referred to as the Dunnottar.  Is that Dunnottar like the Dunnottar Air Base in Boksburg or Springs or wherever it is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Yes I think Chair, no the correct is Dunnottar Air Base, not gang, as in training school air base.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Did you know anybody, group Dunnottar Group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> No not that I can recall, I though it was a surname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Sorry, forgive me, I'm not familiar with these pronunciations, I think it's Dunnottar now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a>	Did you know Mr Russel Davidson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Only just to greet and speak to and only because he went to school with my older brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> He wasn't a friend of yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> No, not a friend of mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> So he wouldn't fall of the ambit of the friends, the six or seven that you spoke about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I don't think so, he might - by face I'd know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> You do know however that Mr Davidson was at the time you so frequented the Why Not bar the owner of that bar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Yes I did know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And he was a friendly person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Well he battled to give me a shirt after the bomb you know so I don't know how friendly he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Well, did you know that he, Mr Davidson, was a member of the Dunnottar bike club?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Up until now I'm not too sure what this Dunnottar bike club is all about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> You see, I'm instructed that a group of Dunnottar bikers, if you'd pardon that phrase, had frequented the Why Not.  Mr Davidson was a member of this Dunnottar club, he as client of mine has told me so.  Now most of these Dunnottar bikers were SADF pilots, you cannot dispute that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> To be honest, I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think it's quite clear he doesn't know, he won't be able to dispute or deny what you're saying, he's just unaware of it and also I gathered from the evidence, my impression might have been wrong, but that these people were from Gauteng or Transvaal, from Dunnottar and they would come in as a group for a week or so at a time and then out.  They weren't local, the impression I got from what I heard of them before, local Durban crowd who used to go there once a week, every week of the year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Except that Mr Davidson owned the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Chair, if you'll bear with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a>	Sorry, as an ardent surfer, you must have surfed on the Durban surfs as well in the '86's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> In the 80?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> '86?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Ja, in the early '80s.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Do you recall at the time that - sorry, firstly I presume you would have surfed on the Marine Parade directly in front of say Why Not or in that vicinity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Mostly down South Beach and in the early '70's I surfed in the first or second Gunston 500.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Now would you agree that in all those areas you spoke of, no non-whites were allowed at the time to surf in those areas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> In the early '80's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I'm not aware of that, I just didn't think they - I didn't think they were educated into surfing, surfing wasn't their natural sport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> No, we're talking about ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I'm talking about surfing on a surfboard, I'm not talking about swimming.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I'm talking about the general usage of the beach in the area, the sea in the area that you surfed.  Did you not see the signs on the outside on the shore at the beach saying no blacks, no dogs allowed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> In 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> No I think maybe Morris Fin cut the board down, I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Okay, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Dehal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Chair.  So you recall these signs, you were aware of them but you were also aware of Mr Fin having then cut them all off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do we need the evidence from Mr Jeffers about whether he saw signs or not, Mr Dehal, what are you trying to get at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Nothing more than the fact that I'm preparing for argument at the end relative to his absence of knowledge on the political scenario, the political situation in this country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Well, if you're trying to establish that apartheid existed you can take it for granted, we accept that it did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I accept that, my difficulty is in regard to this witnesses knowledge or ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> It's not going to take us further, one way or the other.  We know apartheid existed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And this witness hasn't come to say that he was politically aware, made any suggestion of that at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a>	Did you know a Mr Erasmus or a Mr Nel or a Mr Engelbrecht?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you can be a little bit more specific because we don't now want to hear about a whole lot of Mr Nels, Erasmuses and Engelbrechts who worked at Toyota or who were surfers, which if you could just home in a little bit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thanks Chair, I was just about to complete that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a>	These are three men who featured as state witnesses in the earlier trial of Robert McBride, they claimed that they had been present at the Why Not bar on that night.  Did you know of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I can't recall those names at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Did you ever do any service in the police force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Not ever?</p>

<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Sorry, he didn't do service, he did surfing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Chair, that is all.</p>

<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You describe bombs going off at the time.  What effect did they have on you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> In what respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> We know that he was a victim of a bomb blast and he had to undergo medical treatment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> No, there were other bombs besides the particular one.  Did the fact that the Chamberlain bomb go off near you effect your workplace, have an effect on your mind or your perception of life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> No really, it just - we got the day off work because they could put the factory lights back on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When you say work colleagues came with you, what work colleagues?</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Guys at work.  Friends of mine from work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What sort of, did they - so that means there was no special method of selection of them or anything else?  No differences between them in race or clothes?</p>

<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it Hayden, thank you Mr Richard, I had it down as Hadden.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Hayden.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I think Haddon is more correct, H-A-D-D.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you still know him Mr Jeffers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> I still know him, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Why can't he come to these hearings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> Because he phoned me a couple of weeks ago, he's been unemployed for some time and he had to go for - what do you call it when you go to work on a Monday - not an interview, an induction and he didn't think that if couldn't ask for time off because it was a shut down and the work would only last for about three weeks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR RICHARD</p>

<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Judge Pillay?  Mr Jeffers, I've just got one.  On that night in question the 14th June you say you walked there, we've heard that it was drizzling, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You also said that at that time of the night that time of the week there was usually a lot of people around.  Would the drizzle have an effect on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR JEFFERS:</span> It was a very light drizzle at the time and as far as I'm concerned I don't think it would have an effect on that.  I walked there so it wasn't a problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Any questions arising?  Thank you Mr Jeffers, that concludes your evidence.</p>

We're prepared to carry on, I don't know it would be ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Chairman, may we just establish how many more witnesses or presentations are going to happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I have one more particular witness that is relevant to the fact of the matter.  A bar person who worked at the hotel at the time.  I can't see from where I sit whether she's still here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will it be convenient to proceed or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It would be convenient to proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I have no difficulty in proceeding.  May I call her?   Our next witness is Ms Kearney as she also will take the oath.</p>

<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  Ms Kearney, in and during 1986 where did you live and work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> I lived in the Parade Hotel itself, on the second floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And for how long did you live there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Two years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now where did you work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> At the Parade Hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And for how long did you work at the Parade Hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Seven years between the Why Not and Magoo's bar and two years in Garfunkel's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Two years where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Two years in Garfunkel's Bar Restaurant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you worked seven years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> In the Why Not and Magoo's bar, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And an additional two years in ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you'd been - is that by 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You'd already been working in the establishment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> From '81 to '87.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You worked from, in ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> In the Parade Hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> In other words it was not seven years, it is seven years in total?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> In total in the Why Not and Magoo's bar and a further two in Garfunkel's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So that's nine in total?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Right in what capacity were you employed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> I was first employed as a barmaid, then I was head barmaid of all three bars which Garfunkel's opened a new bar so I was the head barmaid between Magoo's, Why Not and Garfunkel's, I was also manageress for two years which I dealt with the hotel itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now how long were you manageress for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> For two years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When would you have been the manageress of the hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> I was manageress from 1987 to 1988.  From '86 to '88.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Would you please describe to us what the establishment known as Garfunkel's is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Garfunkel's was a restaurant and an entertainment centre as well with music and it was a late night entertainment organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when you say entertainment, what sort of entertainment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Well they had a live band there as well and the food was very good and you had a passageway through from the Magoo's and the Parade Hotel right through so you had a non-stop venue in all three bars.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So in fact Garfunkel's was for all purposes part of the Parade Hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Oh yes, definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And it was hotel space above it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now then so as to achieve clarity, which pub adjoined onto Garfunkel's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> The Why Not bar was directly behind it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When you say behind it was that the east or the west?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Well it's the front of the hotel, the front of the Parade Hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think we've got the Why Not was on the Marine Parade, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On the corner and then if you walked away from the Marine Parade down that side street you would get to Garfunkel's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEERNEY:</span> That's exactly, but we had a door adjacent that was open, if you're going in and out of Garfunkel's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Directly from Garfunkel's into Why Not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You could get from the one to the other without going down a passage or going out of the building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now if I could put it correctly, the Parade Hotel is situate on the corner of Serridge and Marine Parade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And the Garfunkel Restaurant faced only onto the Serridge Road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And in fact faced south?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And if I then proceed, Why Not Pub was on the south east corner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think we've got this one that was facing east on the side then the Magoo's was to the north of the Why Not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Also facing the Marine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What sort of person patronised the Why Not pub?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> The Why Not was more of a social, quieter pub.  If you wanted to have a gathering or a meeting or conversation with your friend or your loved one or whatever the case was, it was a quieter pub, they played music whereas Magoo's was a very heavy live band action bar</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now in and during June 1986 is it not correct to say it was the in place and much in vogue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Not only in '86, it had been the in place for about 5 years non-stop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And accordingly a very popular ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> I said a most popular with the most regulars frequenting the Why Not and Magoo's Pub and Garfunkel's for that matter, for that matter of fact.  I saw faces there for the next six years that were regulars practically every day and every weekend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now how well did you get to know the patrons who attended all three?</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Quite well, quite well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, if I may just intervene, Mr Richard?  During June 1986, were you - what were you then, Ms Kearney?  Were you then a barmaid or were you manageress at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> No I was the head barmaid, I had to run between the three pubs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Of the three outlets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So you - what was the head barmaid, did you check stocks, check that the fridge is alright?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> And checked that the girls had everything they needed, change, stock from the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then you had barmen or barladies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> That's right, two in each pub.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In each pub, so you weren't so much behind the counter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> I was not that much behind the bar at that stage I was running three pubs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were more managerial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Richards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now prior to 1986 you had been a barlady?</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> For how long were you a barlady?</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Well from the time I'd started in 1971.  Only the Why Not bar was in action at the time, we built Magoo's in 1982.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So in fact you were associated with the Parade Hotel from 1971?</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> From '81.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> '81, sorry, I misunderstood.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And for how long were you so to speak floor barlady?</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> I was barlady until '86.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Until '86?</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So as at June '86 for how long had you either not been a barlady as opposed to chief barlady?  What was the situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> I was barlady until '86 and then they made me head barlady and then five months later they made me manageress for two years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When did they make you head barlady?</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> In '86?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> The fourteenth - what was that answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> January of '86.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> You were what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Made the head barlady.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now during the period January '86 and June '86, did you lose contact with your customers and clientele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And were they well known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Very well known.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now if we take it this way on a Saturday night how many people would fit into the Garfunkel's Restaurant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Garfunkel's was sometimes packed to capacity.  It was a very large establishment.  We used to have to sometimes close the door and queues would be outside to get in and we weren't allowed to have that many people inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you on the premises on the 14th June?</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you recall what the patronage was like on that particular evening, if you could just describe it to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes I can.  Well Magoo's was packed to capacity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> How much was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> I'd say about 180 people squeezed into that tiny space in Magoo's bar.  I'd say the Why Not bar had about 160 people and Garfunkel's tables were full.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And how many people could be seated in Garfunkel's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> In Garfunkel's approximately 200 people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now why do you recall so clearly that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Well I work, that is my work log, this is something that you learn and this is something that you cope with.  As far as getting stocks and seeing how many people are in bars you know exactly when the fridges are empty to the clientele which you need in the pub.</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now let's start with the residential hotel part.  How many rooms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> We have five floors and we have eighty rooms and on the first floor we have twenty three back rooms down the side and round the back which was let out to students of all walks of life and different colours, elderly people, for accommodation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When you say to students of all sorts and walks of life and colours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, you say those twenty three back rooms they were let out to what you may call permanents, people who would take it for a month or even a year maybe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Students, permanents, yes residents, yes.  They had to sign for three months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So yes, you would classify them as permanents and they would do their own thing in their room, they didn't have to rely on Garfunkel's for their dinner or anything like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Not at all, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Chairperson, it has been indicated to me that my two clients to my left need to go home to their families and children and may they be excused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Certainly.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And Ms Kearney also indicated to me that she is expected at work shortly.  May I ask for how long it would be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't know how long any cross-questioning would take but otherwise we can decide when we finish here how much time she needs and maybe do cross-examination tomorrow.  Just depending, I don't know if we can get some indication of how long.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> No problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't know how long you will be Mr Richards?  When do you have to be at work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> 5 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 5 o'clock?  I think it would be better if we could get to the end of evidence-in-chief, you know, rather than adjourning midway?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Certainly.  Now you said people of all races and colours were ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Permanent residents, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Were there any police, soldiers, sailors, traffic cops?</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Permanent residents?  No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now that was on the first floor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now on the second to fifth floors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Second to fifth floors, second was mainly staff, there were a few rooms that were let out to clientele which I mean is the day-trippers coming in for two days or one day at a time.  Third, fourth and fifth floors were for holidaymakers, tourists or whoever wanted to book into the hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was there any colour bar on who may take accommodation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> No, definitely not, not in five floors.  At one stage we had some Kenyan people down for seven days seminar and they had the fifth floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And if a local South African of colour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> They could choose any room they wanted, there was no difference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now you've heard mention of a Dunnottar motor cycle gang have you ever ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> No, I have to correct that, there was no such thing as a Dunnottar Motor Cycle Club, it was a Dunnottar Air Base Club.  They used to come down once every two years, 19 year olds to about 22, 23 year olds with a major or a lieutenant and even fly down in their Dakotas and were given Friday and Saturday as a weekend off for entertainment and they came down to the entertainment that was offered them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that quite a big group of them that would come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> It was about twenty four of them, yes, with the lieutenant, but it was not a motor cycle club, it was the Dunnottar Air Base club.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now how often would that happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> That was the general thing for about two years at a time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Every second year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Every second year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And would other members of that air base come and stay there at any other time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> No, not to my knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now during the six months prior to the 14th June, had the Dunnottar Air Base people been in the hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> They had been the previous year April, around April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> That is April '85?</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Had they been there at any time after?</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  Now your vantage of being both a barlady and then chief barperson, did you know your clientele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Pretty well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now would you have known whether any people fitting into the descriptions of soldiers, sailors, firemen, traffic cops, Security personnel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes, I would know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now did they frequent your hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> A lot did, they're from all walks of life, we never had - the first law we learnt when we went into the hotel trade was we were given a sheet of paper and under no circumstances those days with the laws were we allowed to serve anybody in uniform, whether it be fire brigade, policemen, whether it be traffic department, or motor bike policemen, we were told no uniform was allowed to be - anybody in uniform was allowed to be served.  As far as plain clothed, we did have, we did have, we had plain clothed policemen there on various occasions, we had traffic departments, we had the fire brigade, I got to know all these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And indeed you told me that in fact it was a group of about twenty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> At the most, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> That you got to know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now it is also correct that at no one stage did all twenty come as a cohesive group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> I have never seen that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, just to get this into perspective I just want to find out what you're saying Ms Kearney, you say that you knew about twenty of these - let's call them servicemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Be they policemen or firemen or whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying that they were the only twenty who came there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Oh no, I don't say that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They're the ones that you got to know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes, the ones that I knew, that I could actually say that he's a cop, he's a security man or he's from the traffic department or he's the head surfer from the Surfing Association.  That I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now if of that group of twenty, let me rephrase that, sorry, you are saying that if you were to count the number of people falling within the definition that we've outlined and frequented the hotel over a six month, one year period, you say it would total twenty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> At one time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, the witness never said that and my learned friend is now leading evidence himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes I think she's basically said that she can say that servicemen did attend regularly, she knows about twenty of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now how many might possibly ever have been there at one time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you talking of the people she knew?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Well in each different category?</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> In the whole category.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> In the whole category I would say one Friday afternoon I had three traffic departmental gentlemen who actually wrote me out a ticket once as well, I had two firemen and I had five security policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was that all on one ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> That was all one Friday afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And how often would that happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> They seemed to like their Friday afternoons drinking from about 3 o'clock in the afternoon whether they were allowed to come off early from work or whatever the case.  Maybe it seemed to be that was the trend on a Friday afternoon everybody had to come to the bar from about 3 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And on a Friday afternoon at the periods between 3 and 6 p.m. how many people in total would be in the pubs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Many people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Approximately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> 60, 70, maybe a 100.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now on the evening in question how full were the various bars?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Very full.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We've got the numbers, Mr Richard, she said there were in her estimation approximately 180 in Magoo's, 160 in the Why Not and plus minus 200 in Garfunkel's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Right, now of that concentration of people, how many in your experience might have been so to speak Security personnel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Well in the early stages of the evening, we start our shift at 4 o'clock, some at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the bars only start filling up at about 7, 7.30, 8.  Magoo's especially, they come in to get their seats because it gets packed and that fills up very fast, that's the fastest bar that we had that evening.  Why Not was a little bit slower and during the course of the evening you see the same faces as well as people you don't know filtering into the bars and by about half past eight the Why Not bar was pretty full.  We'd also had a very big reception at the door because there were youngsters having a 21st or a university party or something and we remembered pulling over a few more tables and chairs to accommodate them so it was very big and as far as Security personnel, well I didn't see any that evening.  Not one, if they were hidden or if I did not take notice, that is all I can say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now on that night at sometime around half past nine, what sort of activity would there have been outside the hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Well ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think it's better to ask that question directly, Mr Richard, you know what activity was there, did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> The normal, I think normal every day, every night you have a lot of people walking up and down the golden mile as they call it, they do pub crawling from pub to pub, not only that, there's a lot of tourists walking around looking at buildings, taking photographs, there's a lot of pedestrians, there's a lot of traffic, there's a lot of noise coming from the parade itself.  The Why Not bar's a noisy bar but Magoo's bar is very noisy, you can actually hear the loud music from the street, the old fashioned windows in Why Not bar used to open up those days, you could actually see exactly what was taking place from the pavement and weekends was very busy, I'd say they were very busy, the beach front, always has been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Were the windows up that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes the windows were up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now parking outside the hotel, would it have been an easy matter to find car park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> No, no, there was never easy parking at the Parade Hotel, it was always busy and always full.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now somebody walking up the road, past the hotel, would they have been able to see into the hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes if the windows are up, there were the old fashioned windows, we didn't have the two way glass at the time.  You can see people sitting in there from the street level from outside.  There often conversations took place between the people parked in their cars or standing outside the motor car into the windows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And if you had looked into the Magoo's bar would you have been able to see in from the street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> No, the Magoo's bar had a very heavy glass and you can see shapes and sizes and hear the music and if you went up very close then you can see through the glass but from the street you can't see how packed it is until you get into the foyer but the Why Not bar was a totally different bar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now were you ever politically aware?</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Apartheid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes, very much so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What is your attitude to what was known as apartheid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Well I was brought up in a different way, my parents brought me up to respect everybody, as a little girl, regardless of colour.  The first and utmost thing in life is respect, if you respect somebody else you will receive respect and ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now - carry on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> We often spoke on the subject, there were lots of ladies that frequented Why Not bar, there were gentlemen such as Jonathan Jeffers, I've known him for many years as one of the patrons.  So do I known Carl Hayden who was injured, a German chappie that used to love the Why Not bar and a lot of other people and the feeling I got was that I would say that sixty percent voted for Helen Suzman at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So there were political discussions within the Why Not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> There were to the extent of whose going to vote and who do you vote for, it was actually on a very easy basis, it wasn't, it wasn't something that we discussed because we always told everyone we don't discuss sex, politics or religion in bars because this led to very, very bad relationships in pubs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you ever have any such bad relationships?</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> No, not really because we tried to stop something as soon as it started, same as bad language, same as bad behaviour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now personally, did you support apartheid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> No, not at all, we can say that now as everybody says but we were the minority and if you ask yourself what could we do?  Well, that was possible that we could do?  I actually was the one who started, Mr Brian Watermeyer at the time took over from Mr Russel Davidson at the Parade Hotel and asked me what should we do with the back rooms, Helen?  And I said let it to the people, let me handle it and we did and it was 90 percent black people that stayed at the Parade Hotel in the permanent residence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> As at June 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Absolutely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now would there have been any difficulty whatsoever in ascertaining any of these facts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Not at all, the records are there, the rooms were booked, it's all down in black and white, it's all on paper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now if somebody were so to speak to conduct a reconnaissance, would it have been difficult or hard to ascertain who was in your residential rooms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Would it have been difficult or hard to ascertain whether there were many people inside on a Saturday night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> No, not difficult at all, you only have to walk through the front door which was open all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Would a person of colour be stopped at the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Not at all, I don't believe this at all, in all the time I've worked there it was your choice.  We had, don't forget in the six and a half years of the popularity of Magoo's and the Why Not bar, we had a band from England, they were called "On the Brink", the gentleman in question was an Indian man and he was married to a white lady from London and on popularity they stayed a whole year in Magoo's bar, a year contract they were so popular so and then six months later we had a five piece coloured band, so what was the problem?  I keep asking what was the problem that Mr McBride alone was told that he was not allowed to have entrance in when I had people from all walks of life, from all over the world?  I had political people in from Kenya, I had high people from Arabia, they were given the best room, what was the problem I ask myself that one person was not allowed into the Magoo's bar?  Maybe it was full that evening, maybe one more person could not fit in but the Why Not bar was available, Garfunkel's was available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So we don't know from the evidence who refused entry, it might even have been a patron.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Who - there's nobody there except the manageress or the barmaids to tell you that you are or aren't allowed in and the door is open, there's no lock on the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Were there any bouncers employed at the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> No, we had a gentleman called Samson, he was a black fellow and he was at the door mainly to stop the patrons walking out with glasses or bottles into the street which was not allowed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And would he have ever stopped a person entering?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Perhaps if they were very drunk or if they were disorderly or within the rules or regulations of the hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And what were those rules and regulations?</p>

<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think there's any suggestion of any those rules being applicable for purposes of this hearing, Mr Richard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  I think at this stage I've laid the basis of her evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'd just like to ask one question before we adjourn.  Were you present when the bomb went off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes, I was injured in the bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh, I was just going to ask, did you receive injuries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you could just briefly tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> To my legs I had glass, big panes of glass enter my legs, I have the scars and I had trouble with my ears and I still have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And where precisely were you in the establishment when you got those injuries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> In the Why Not bar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were in the Why Not bar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> But fortunately behind a concrete pillar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Sorry, there are a number of questions I haven't asked yet, if I could deal with it Chair?  May I?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a>	Now, did you visit the hotel after the explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes we did, we were there the next day for cleaning operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now where was the hotel damaged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Well the whole of the Why Not bar was blown in through Garfunkel's, the partitioning was right through into Garfunkel's, Garfunkel's section was blown out into the back kitchen, the one section of Magoo's was damaged on the first corner of Magoo's was damaged but the Why Not bar, the fifth floor, right to the fifth floor was damaged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> In what way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> The windows were blown away, the ceilings were blown away, I think the structures was just about what was left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now do you know whether any persons in the rooms upstairs were injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes there were two old ladies, they were injured, they were sitting at the window at the time.  They had abrasions and cuts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now of the persons injured do you know how many were injured in Magoo's bar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Out of Magoo's and Why Not, I think there were four only seriously injured in Magoo's bar.  The rest were the Why Not bar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> How many do you believe, I know it might be difficult for you to reconstruct, how many people do you think were injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> I think a lot more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> A lot more than?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> A lot more than was listed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now after the explosion did the police prevent people from leaving the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes they did, they cordoned the hotel off very, very quickly.  After the bomb itself Mr Davidson came in and was shouting that he thinks there's a second bomb because it seems to be the trait of the attackers lately that they set a second bomb off and can we get ourselves removed as fast as possible and this time the Holiday Inn had sent across blankets and bandages and all kinds of things but then we were being cordoned off by the bomb squad and Security Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> However if you were a lightly injured person could you have left the site?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Yes, definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> There was no systematic method whereby ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> No, because when Mr Davidson - this had just occurred and I'd say 90 percent of us didn't know what had happened, people were walking around in circles and we really didn't know what had happened at and with Mr Davidson shouting "Get out, get out, there's a second bomb, it's going to go off" everyone just fled, those that could, the others were helped out and taken out by ambulance people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR RICHARD</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  Ms Kearney, I'm afraid you're going to be a bit late for reporting for duty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> I'm sure that's alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I hope you don't get into ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> I'm sure they won't mind, it's okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll now adjourn until what time will be convenient tomorrow?  9 o'clock?  I think 9 o'clock, would 9 o'clock be convenient?</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MS KEARNEY:</span> Fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll adjourn until 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.  Thank you.</p>
