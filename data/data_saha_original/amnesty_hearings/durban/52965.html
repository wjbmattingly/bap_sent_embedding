<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ADV PRIOR:   It is the 16th of November.  We proceed with the amnesty applications of last week and Mr Botha was still being cross-examined.  I have a few questions for Mr Botha, with the leave of the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I have a request before we start, is it possible to twist those lights away a little?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">HENDRIK JOHANNES PETRUS BOTHA:</span> (still under oath)</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Botha, I just have seven aspects that I want to canvass with you.  The first being my understanding of your evidence as well as the evidence of Mr Wasserman et al, regarding Operation Butterfly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>	Was it paramount with the Security Branch, that is your division or your office, to either dismantle those structures or destroy those structures by either prosecuting the members in those various structures or by eliminating those members?  Sorry, the third possibility also, by turning those members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Mr Chairperson, in 1985 with Operation Butterfly, exposure - the prosecution of the members of this movement, and this was the first option.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And it would appear from the evidence and from the documents we have seen, there was great success with the investigation and prosecution of many of those MK members?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is my sense of what happened thereafter correct, that your Branch experienced a sense of frustration at the fact that the court process wasn't one hundred percent effective?  In other words, due to problems that you either did foresee or did not foresee, certain of the accused, the MK cadres were in fact acquitted which gave rise to a sense of frustration within your unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, there was a build up of frustration Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> As you testified last week, you, as well as possibly Colonel Taylor at some stage, came to the realisation that the only effective way to destroy those structures that you had been working on since 1985, Operation Butterfly, the Natal machinery, would be to eliminate those persons in key positions within that machinery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No Mr Chairperson, it was not that the people who were left, had to be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Maybe let me qualify that, the personnel in key positions, for examples Ndwandwe, Portia Ndwandwe, to name an example?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson.  After the arrest and the conviction, or successful conviction of these people, there was from those who were left over from Butterfly, who was not charged at all, they were used as witnesses.  Some of them were not charged at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>	The monitoring of them was in the nature of the case, it was our responsibility and we would continue and we would then, or we decided then that people would continue.  When she left the country to go to Swaziland, she became a primary target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Just to move on briefly on the preparation for the trial.  Would it be correct to suggest that some, if not many of the State witnesses, were in fact coerced into making statements and into giving evidence against their colleagues?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> All those who were detained according to the Act, made Article 29 statements.  In the interviews of these people it was decided who would be willing to act as State witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Would assaults have occasioned the making of those Section 29 statements or not?  I am not suggesting that it was across the board, but what I am driving at is that a lot of those statements that those people made, were they made as a result of coercion or force being applied to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> In terms of the Act, they had to make a statement, yes.  There was pressure on the detainees to make a statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> But you say pressure because of the nature of the provision of the Act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you have told us as I understand your evidence, that practically everybody you questioned, was assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is negative Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Didn't you tell us you punched people, you slapped them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Not all of them Mr Chairperson, it was a few incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The majority?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No Mr Chairperson.  I would say the majority of the people were not attacked or assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That wasn't the impression I got from your evidence last week.  Ndwandwe I think, was about the only one you said, wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Botha, given your position within the Security Force structure in Durban, Port Natal at that stage, were you - let me put it this way, we heard evidence last week that Mr Bhila was eliminated, it would appear on the instructions of Mr Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Am I correct in understanding that you had nothing to do with that episode?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> It never came to your attention that a decision to eliminate Bhila had been taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Had it come to your attention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> With the amnesty application process in 1996, I did take notice, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I am actually talking about at the time, 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative, no, I did not have any knowledge of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> In retrospect, should that information have come to your attention, being the Head of Information gathering, or Intelligence as you were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative.  The fact that a decision was made by Taylor, did not have to be shared with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did that not lead to any friction between you and Mr Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You described your relationship with Mr Taylor as a good one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I just want to develop just briefly on that.  Bhila was described to us last week as being a dangerous terrorist.  He had been acquitted and that seems to have been the underlying motive or reason for killing him?  Would you go along with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> On the same basis, Mr Nxiweni must have been equally dangerous?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yet, we have a situation that Mr Bhila is murdered three days after his acquittal and Mr Nxiweni is almost a year, if not longer after that acquittal, he is eliminated.  Are you able to assist us in just understanding what went wrong, if anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Mr Chairperson, I do not know what Colonel Taylor's idea was at that stage and as I understood in his evidence, it was his decision.  He did not share this decision with me and it was according to the Act that inspired him to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is the name Pindele Mfeti known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Could you please repeat the name and surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Pindele Mfeti?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative Mr Chairperson, I cannot say that I remember this name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Our information is that Pindele Mfeti was also a medical student, I beg your pardon, a law student and was the cousin of Pumeso Nxiweni, and apparently was also a similar age, in his 40's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> I do not know him Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> He disappeared plus minus, more or less around the 25th of April of 1987 and has never been seen since?  I am just asking whether you know or not.  This is a request that has come from the family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>	It would seem at least in the victims' minds, that if Bhila was assassinated for the reasons that have been given here, it would seem also logical that your unit would have been looking for Nxiweni at the same time and that possibly, quite possibly he was mistaken for Pindele Mfeti, who also went missing from the campus, from Allan Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> We heard evidence from Mr Ramatala that bonuses were paid to askaris. I should imagine bonuses were also paid or rewards paid to informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> In the case of the Ndwandwe matter, and I am not asking you to at this stage to reveal the identity of your informers, are you able to tell the Committee whether in any of these operations, Ndwandwe or Nxiweni or the other kwaMashu 3, whether informers were paid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Does that mean that you do not know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, I say in the case of these people, bonuses were not paid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you are sure about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Were rewards paid as opposed to bonuses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> The general term in the case of rewards for those who were trained outside of the country, as in the police, it was used as rewards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> But in this case where Ndwandwe, the operation to obtain Ndwandwe, Portia Ndwandwe, are you able to say out of your own recollection whether rewards were paid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, no bonuses were paid, or another form of reward for her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So in other words no money was paid over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, in her case specifically for the abductions, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And if we can just clarify with the other two incidents, Nxiweni and with the kwaMashu 3?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, no money was  paid for those specific incidents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was there any reason for that?  It seemed to be a departure from the usual practice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative Mr Chairperson.  I would just like to explain that Mr Ramatala's explanation concerning rewards for the askaris of Vlakplaas, is not as it was the normal practice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>	If I can just get an opportunity to explain this.  Informants or any person who gave information that led to the arrest or the elimination of a terrorist ...(recording stopped) ... became R2 500-00 per person.  A certain amount was connected to for example a land mine or a Makarov and these information that we received, were rewarded.  The askaris, if they were to operate here by the identification of a person, led to the arrest of a terrorist and these rewards were then paid to them in Pretoria, at the unit at Head Office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>	In the activity that occurred in Natal, where one of our informants, information led to the arrest of a person, we then paid the person here.  It was sent to Head Office and we then paid that person directly.  We never paid out rewards as we thought fit, and that is concerning the physical identification of such a person and then the arrest of that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> In the case of Portia Ndwandwe, you knew where she was residing in Swaziland before the operation, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did that information filter through via your information network, intelligence network that was already in place in Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> If I may ask you this question, the two informers that assisted you in Swaziland on the day in question to bring Ms Ndwandwe out of Swaziland, they were not part, or they had not given you the information relating to her whereabouts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I am sorry the use of your word negative, you say no, they were not part of the information structure or are you saying that the statement is wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, I agree with your first interpretation of the word negative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Perhaps I should just direct my learned friend's attention in case he wants to ask questions about it, on this issue, on page 86, the last paragraph of volume 2 Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I just want to ask about the actual, physical detention of Portia Ndwandwe in Swaziland.  When you had put her into the kombi, did she acquiesced, did she struggle, did she put up a fight?  Can you explain the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, she did resist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was she subdued?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, I would say that most of us, we could easily hold her, and we then tied her hands with a rope.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> It seems that she obviously, when she realised what was going on, she didn't want to go with you voluntarily and had to be physically restrained and subdued as you have indicated, she was held down and she was cuffed, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You indicated in your evidence that at some stage, she was at the back of a bakkie and you climbed in with her, and you were under a tarpaulin or a cover.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is that when you drove to the Onverwacht border post?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Why was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> It was the only place where we could sit and that was at the back of the bakkie.  Laurie and Sam was in the front and because of the tarpaulin at the back of the bakkie that was to protect us from the weather, it was raining at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> The interrogation at the Onverwacht safe house, are you able just to give us an idea of how long that endured?  Was it three or four hours, was it longer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> If I had to put together the uninterrupted times, I would say that it would have been a maximum of four hours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> At Onverwacht, did it appear clear to you that she wasn't going to cooperate with the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Mr Chairperson, in terms of her cooperation and answering questions regarding information, there was cooperation, but in terms of her willingness as an informer, there was no cooperation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So she was prepared to give you crucial information regarding her unit and the Natal machinery, which you have said, she indicated who Nxiweni was and the operation that he had been involved in, but she wasn't prepared to give her full cooperation as an informer or as an askari, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> That information just came out of a question and answer exercise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> No assaults with no torture whatsoever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Would you agree with me that even at that stage, your branch had virtually all the information that they required regarding the Natal machinery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No Mr Chairperson, I wouldn't say that we had all the information, one would have wanted all the information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Were you interested in tying up who was responsible for what operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> The structure in Swaziland, was one thing, and the structure within the RSA was another, and then we came to the individuals, and there were certain aspects of information in which we would have been interested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> After Onverwacht, when you travelled to Pietermaritzburg, was there any, in your mind, was there any more information that you required from her, given what you knew already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> There was always the possibility of new information coming forth.  She served as the acting Commander of Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> But was there anything concrete or something specifically that you wanted to go for, that you needed to interrogate her about, or was it just that vague possibility that she may come up with something, you giving another interrogation session?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, there was no specific information which I had, which I wanted her to share with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Now, in the Pietermaritzburg safe house, that was on the farm Elandskop, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> How long would you say she was interrogated there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Mr Chairperson, I worked with her for approximately two hours.  If it was indeed that long.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Are you the only person who interrogated her at Pietermaritzburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> No other person interrogated her whilst she was on the farm Elandskop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> As far as I worked with her, from Onverwacht on the farm, I worked with her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did Taylor interrogate her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative Mr Chairperson.  He questioned her at Onverwacht, but not while I was working with her at  Elandskop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> There is some indication that a Mr Labuschagne from the Eastern Transvaal Branch, had questioned her.  Are you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, I am aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Where did that occur?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That occurred after I had already left with the informers.  One of the other applicants will testify regarding that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was that usual practice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes Chairperson, there was nothing strange about that at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> The decision to eliminate her, had already been taken at the time, or just before you left Pietermaritzburg, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Mr Chairperson, when I left the farm, I knew that she was going to be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> But had you discussed that with Mr Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> In the final phase, no I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> In principle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And you had indicated to him, I think my understanding of your evidence is by the time that you left the farm, you were convinced that she wasn't going to be turned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> The two informers, the two persons that assisted you in Swaziland, they left with you from Pietermaritzburg to Durban I understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Would they have been aware of the decision to eliminate Ms Ndwandwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative Mr Chairperson, they wouldn't have been aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> The longer she was out of circulation from Swaziland, wasn't the risk increasingly higher that the MK/ANC structures would be aware that something was wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Absolutely.  The longer the person remained out of circulation, the greater the risk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I need to ask you this question, is there any specific reason why you did not, having made the decision as you have told us about killing Ndwandwe, that you left just before she was to be executed?  That you were not part of that execution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Mr Chairperson, the informers were returned by me to Durban, that was the only reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> But you could have been there when she was executed, and then leave the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, but unfortunately I left before the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So that wasn't part of a discussion or an agreement with Taylor, that they would do the execution, you would get away with the informers, or move away with the informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative.  The informers were on the adjacent farm, they weren't on that farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So if I understand your evidence, it just happened that way, there was no plan or there was no design?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, there was nothing strange about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You were taking the informers away and you knew that Taylor would then do the killing or oversee the killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I know you weren't there, but you obviously must have discussed the killing of Ndwandwe afterwards?  We know from the exhumation that there was no clothing found in the grave.  Would that have been usual to strip the body either after the killing or before the killing?  I just need to know from you whether that would have been usual or common place or are you unable to comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> I would not be able to comment regarding that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Because it would seem from the objective facts that when she was buried at that grave, or in that grave, she was naked, except for a plastic, it seems like a refuge bag that was placed around her pelvic area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, I was not present when they exhumed the body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was there any discussion afterwards of how she was executed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, Mr Chairperson, it was not discussed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You never asked any questions of how they did it, or who pulled the trigger or whatever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative, one never asked questions regarding that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> The information you say you obtained, sorry before we move on, I have been requested to put certain things to you regarding Ms Ndwandwe.  There will be evidence if necessary from various persons, to say that Ndwandwe, Portia Ndwandwe, did not leave the Durban area after her release and that she remained in attendance throughout the Ramlakan trial as part of the audience.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>Are you able to comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, the case was completed and she was released in January 1986, after the completion of the Section 29 hearing.  She remained in Durban until the end of 1986/1987 when she left the country for military training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Can you deny that she was attending the proceedings of the Ramlakan trial?  I should imagine right up until the end of the case in 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> I cannot comment regarding that, because I did not attend the hearing every day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Would it be likely that if she had attended, the Security Branch, were they not monitoring the audience or the supporters of the accused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Once again Mr Chairperson, I wouldn't know what the conduct or decision of that hearing was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Just to get clarity on that last aspect, was it the policy of the Security Branch to monitor who the supporters of the accused were in such a trial?  Would you have known who came to attend the trial or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, one would know who was there and who wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> The APMC of the structure, is it correct that that did not include any internally trained cadres, but was formed by externally trained cadres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> The APMC consisted of internally and externally trained terrorists Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is it correct that in 1986, she could not have been in charge of any combat unit because it would seem on what I have heard thus far, she had not yet been trained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> She had already been trained internally during the Ramlakan period.  If I am referring to that specific period, the APMC, the functioning of Butterfly, before the arrest on the 23rd of December 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is it not close to the truth that she was arrested simply for being at the house where Ramlakan and others were arrested, that she had been assisted by Ramlakan in her studies and that he had also provided her with accommodation because of problems she had with her in-laws or family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> She was more than simply that.  She lived there, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And that she may possibly have done secretarial functions, but she certainly wasn't a trained combatant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> She was Mr Chairperson.  She along with another person by the name of Ricky Naidoo fulfilled a number of functions in the command of Ramlakan and the other people from the place where they worked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You indicated in your evidence that one Braso had made phone call to the Ramlakan home just before the arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is it not, well, I have been requested to put this to you, that it wasn't Braso, but one Ralph Lawrence who had made that call, and he had spoken to Sibusiso Sithle Mbongwa also known as George Fukudi and that that conversation was recorded on tape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct, the conversation was recorded by us with monitoring.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> But with Ralph Lawrence made the call?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative, it was Braso, Raymond Lala.  He made a number of calls to that address, his voice was familiar to us.  His voice was that of an Indian.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> There is just one other aspect, it would appear from bundle 3 that there was a report  that Portia Ndwandwe's home was burgled on the very day or the evening of the day she was kidnapped out of Swaziland.  There was an allegation that an amount of about R20 000 or R25 000 was missing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>	Do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> I am aware of the report which appeared in the newspaper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Well, were any of your operatives in the area, you had abducted her.  Was any of the instructions to go and see what could be found at the home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative Mr Chairperson, there was no order, I don't think that they were responsible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Do you agree that it certainly raises a suspicion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson, but the circumstances could have been manipulated by someone within the ANC in order to steal that money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Du Preez and Wasserman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You say couldn't get through the border post  because of the lateness of the hour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Do you know where they slept before they came through the border post the next day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did they know where Ndwandwe lived in Manzini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> They knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Just finally on this aspect, your Intelligence network, was there any information regarding the burglary or the breaking in?  I mean your Intelligence network was in place in Swaziland, was there any information forthcoming from that source?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> The only report which there was about the burglary appeared coincidentally in a Swazi newspaper and through the South African media.  That was the only reference made to that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I think Mr Botha, that the question is whether you from your information network, heard anything about the burglary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> I understood the question correctly.  The only knowledge which we had regarding this burglary, was not by means of our information network, but by means of the media.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I don't want to belabour this too much, but on what your answer is, no one within the ANC knew that she had been abducted or kidnapped on that day, they only came to realise that later.  They would have no reason to have exploited that fact, not having known about it at that specific time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Chairperson, we were not even aware of an amount of R25 000.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Let's forget the amount, just the fact of the burglary at that time, the day that she was kidnapped by your unit, the ANC would not have known about it and therefore I am suggesting to you that it seems improbable that they would have exploited that fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No comment Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I want to move on to Pumeso Nxiweni.  You have had sight of Exhibit H?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> That was the sort of consultation notes of the Investigative Unit of the Amnesty Committee.  I don't intend going through the ...(indistinct) verba  of everything here, but if you look at the fourth page, where under the title possible assistants Sithle Mbongwa, is there anything there that you wish to disagree with?  I think you may have answered that a short while ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Do you wish to add anything, that is regarding Ndwandwe being at Ramlakan's house and the reason why she was there?  Do you want to add anything to what you have already answered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> All that I confirm here is that the facts are not correct, that she was at Ramlakan's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> If you can go to the next page, that is the fifth page, Naya Ngema, do you wish to comment on the notes there or the information there?  Let me maybe ask you correctly, Naya Ngema who survived, he was the member that went to Swazi, he never turned up in the kwaMashu 3 at the meeting that was arranged with your informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Can you dispute or do you deny that it was his unit that carried out six of the bombings that you attributed to Nxiweni's unit, the Allan Taylor unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Sorry, do you challenge that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, I say that this unit was under the command of Nxiweni as Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> He will give evidence and say that that wasn't the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That may be his evidence, but that was our knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Further down the page, he says that his unit was responsible for the six attacks, Pinetown post office, Glenashley shopping centre, Westville post office and a blast in kwaMashu, the Bree railway station and the Red Hill post office.  In other words, that was the swimmers' unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is that correct, are you saying, did you know about the swimmers' unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> They were all known to us as the kwaMashu unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And you say Nxiweni was part of the Allan Taylor unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> He had a unit with Allan Taylor which was known as the Allan Taylor unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Were those two distinct units or did they fall under the umbrella of the kwaMashu unit, I don't quite understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Perhaps just to explain.  If a person was a Commander in a determined area such as Durban, he could have up to five units under his command, and in this case Nxiweni was identified to us as Commander of a number of units.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is it correct that at the time of his kidnapping, if I may call it that, that is Nxiweni, that he was busy preparing for the year end party at the residence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, I am not aware of what he was busy with at the Allan Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Your evidence was that weapons and ammunition were found at the Allan Taylor residence after Nxiweni had been detained, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And they had been, well, it would not have been difficult to link him with those weapons and explosives, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Well, he gave us the directions to the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And if you had charged him for those weapons, he would in all likelihood have received a fairly substantial term of imprisonment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> If his fingerprints were to be found on those exhibits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Or other evidence, there could have been other evidence, that he pointed out the spot, that he knew where it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> The fingerprints would have just been some additional evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> But if he had been convicted for those articles, he would have received a substantial term of imprisonment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> At least what, five, six years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Minimum of five years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Minimum?  And you could have effectively taken him out of circulation on that basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you contemplate that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Had the decision already been made at a different time that he was to be eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you weren't interested, I think you have told us already, in getting him before a Court and convicting him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> On the fifth page at the bottom, one Siphiso Kunene, was he known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Do you have any comment to make on his information that he will give?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, with respect, we all know that this is not a permissible way of asking questions of a witness.  If my learned friend wants to ask a question, let him put the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>	We know that in procedure, one doesn't just place a document before a witness and say is there something that you disagree with and then take your cross-examination from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>	With respect, it doesn't lead anywhere Mr Chairman, and it is unfair to the witness because he doesn't know what the question is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I take note of that.  I was trying to save some time, but I see that it is not going to assist.  Siphiso Kunene states and that will be his evidence that his unit, which was the Chesterville unit, was reporting to Mapumulo in Swaziland and that they had no link to Nxiweni.  Could you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And that it was his unit that were responsible for the two CNA bombs that went off and not Nxiweni's unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Once again, Chairperson, as I said units in Durban fell under the command of Nxiweni, whether or not they had direct command contact with him, is unknown to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>	But I would just like to indicate in paragraph 3 of Ngema's evidence on the same page, the question that you asked me about whether there was a liaison, I told you that Pila once instructed them to make contact with Nxiweni to obtain weapons in an emergency.  He sent one of the unit members who did not know Nxiweni to the meeting.  He does not know who this person met with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>	That simply confirms what I said that there was contact between them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes, there was contact, but we will leave it at that.  The suggestion that was put to you, is that after his acquittal Nxiweni played no active role in the combatant situation, the combat situation in Natal because of the very fact that he was known to you, that he had been acquitted, that he was obviously being observed or watched or whatever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> For a period of time after that, he became active again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I think you have agreed, during the interrogation of him, that you slapped him on a number of occasions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did anybody else interrogate him from your own knowledge, any of the other applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Just mention them to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> The only people present was Du Preez and Van der Westhuizen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did Mr Du Preez assault him in your presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.  Du Preez slapped him in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> With a fist?  Also with a fist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> And he hit him as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And Van der Westhuizen as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> It never escalated to anything more than a slapping or a punching, there was no instruments used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, no instruments were used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Sorry, you were also not present at Nxiweni's execution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.  If Colonel Taylor had not arrived that afternoon, he and Wasserman, Du Preez and I would have eliminated Nxiweni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is there any reason why Taylor who was the Head of the unit, hadn't been informed about Nxiweni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> He was not in Durban at the time of the decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> He just slotted in, he came suddenly at the farm or the safe house and he just took over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct, if my memory serves me correctly, he had arrived back from Swaziland that afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> The kwaMashu 3, I think you explained in quite a lot of detail how you got them to the meeting place and what happened.  In this case there was no need to interrogate them, is that right, because the decision to execute them, had been made before their detention or their arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> The positioning of the bodies after they were shot, was that to destroy any evidence that they had been shot, in other words, they were placed with their heads onto the explosives, so that there would be no come back at any later stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you, I have no further questions.  Sorry, I have been asked to put this question, did your branch or did your unit clear the DLB in the kwaMashu area under the control of the kwaMashu unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> There were only three limpet mines in their presence.  The DLB's clearing was done by the Investigative Officer and if I remember correctly, a carrier bag and other forms of proof were found at a house which were tested positively for explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>	There were such exhibits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Are you able to tell us which house it was that this bag was found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Mr Chairperson, I can't remember, but I think that that information was given to the Investigative Team.  There was a dossier with that information contained in it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Can you just tell us who maybe the Investigating Officer is so that we can follow this up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> It was Warrant Officer Petser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOLTE:</span> Mr Chairman, no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NGUBANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No re-examination, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> There is just one aspect that I want to clarify with you.  You mentioned that the reason why you eliminated these people was because there was pressure on you to solve the problem, that is the problem of terrorism in the region.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>	I want to find out who exerted this pressure on you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Mr Chairperson, daily we had morning conferences under the Chairpersonship of Gen Steyn, his rank was then Colonel and then later Brigadier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>	Apart from those morning conferences, there were special meetings held with the Officers' Corps whereby at various opportunities it was said that we must get this country out of this mess.  We cannot allow terrorism to take over and Colonel Steyn was a very fiery person when it is about the activities.  He places pressure on you to such an extent that it didn't matter for us how long we worked in a day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>	That, and then certain statements by politicians, activity requests for cross border operations, if there would be acts of terror the SADF would then react in a counter attack.  We had to react on all of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did this mean to you, that the only way was to kill people the only way that you could alleviate this pressure, was to kill people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> In some instances yes, Mr Chairperson.  In my opinion it was the only solution for the problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> The fact that there was this cross border raids by the SADF, did that, how did that put pressure on you as members of the Security Branch?  Was there some form of competition between the Security Branch and the SADF?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Negative, there was no competition who could succeed the most, but what I am trying to say there is that as with the politician statement, that we would follow them to wherever they go, and then there were certain cross border raids where we followed certain terrorists and I thought it right that when there were certain operations internally, in terms of elimination of people who were involved, or was in control of certain acts of terror.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did you feel that you were safe with your acts?  In other words did you feel that you were safe with your acts of eliminating people with your illegal acts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson, I knew that if it was executed in such a way that no one could point a finger, it would be safe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And what if somebody could point a finger at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Then we would have to carry the consequences.  I then believed that I would receive assistance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> From where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> From within the structures of the South African Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> In other words, there was a culture of covering up illegal acts, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, that is not what I am saying.  Chairperson what I am saying is that I believed that I would be assisted.  I have never been in a position where there was a cover up and where people in our own department was misled concerning certain acts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> What was the basis of your belief that you would be assisted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> I believed that if we were so manipulated, we would not be directly implicated in a matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The investigation that followed after the kwaMashu 3, that you said Warrant Officer Petser led?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he ever make contact with the Security Branch or firstly, was he in the Uniform Branch or which branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, he was from the Investigative Personnel from the Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he ever ask you if the operatives under your control, had any involvement in it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, negative Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he never consider that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, it was never considered.  It was only dealt with as a purely terrorist investigation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And then just your answers on questions that Mr Prior put to you, specifically concerning Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>	You testified that the first time that you heard about Bhila's elimination and how it occurred, was with the amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The evidence that we heard earlier on, concerning the applications of Bosch and others and McCarter as well as Wasserman, and that is that he then continued with his activities and that Taylor put it to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, I heard that evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In other words, he was an active member of one of the structures, otherwise he wouldn't have been charged in the first place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you picked him up with your involvement in investigations in Amanzimtoti and as well as the Ramlakan case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you have knowledge of the fact that he suddenly appeared out of circulation in the structures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson.  The information at that stage was that he left the country for further military training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who gave you this information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> It came through the normal information structures.  He was a prominent person.  He was not the only person who at that stage, disappeared for training outside of the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The people who went for training outside of the country, did you also try to follow them with the information structure, to find out what they were doing and where they were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you try to follow Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> I believe so Mr Chairperson, there would be a dossier for him, concerning him leaving the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You never asked Wasserman if he would know anything about Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No, it was not necessary for me to ask this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> There was nothing that made me suspicious that there was something else, that he just left the country for military training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you think that the elimination actions, that you were involved in, were the only ones that took place within your unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, I believed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You did not think that any of the other members were involved in acts like these except where you were in command and coordinated it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, that is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> May the witness be excused Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I have a few questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I am sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have just told us that the information you got from the normal channels was that Bhila had left the country for military training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And we know that information is totally inaccurate and unreliable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> I agree with you there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So your other similar information, may have been equally unreliable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why should just Bhila be inaccurate?  Why should you be able that other information was accurate?  You told us that the Bhila information came through your normal channels?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And we know that it was totally inaccurate, don't we?  You have just agreed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Mr Chairperson, I also heard from the evidence of Wasserman that it was created that this person just left the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And we know don't we, that he couldn't have gone back to any activities, because he was murdered three days after he was released?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> I heard that in the evidence, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think in fact the instructions, the evidence was that the instructions were given a day or so after his release.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It would seem again false information was given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, if the legend was created, that had to be carried out, that was the information that we received.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Going back to Nxiweni.  Do you know who I am talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You had the opportunity as I understand it, to have charged him with the unlawful possession of firearms and explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you didn't bother to do anything further about that, because you had already decided to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So, your interest wasn't seeing if you could lawfully take him out of circulation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> Mr Chairperson, the decision to eliminate Nxiweni, was taken already when we took him.  The information concerning the ammunition or the trunk of ammunition, was only made that evening after I took the decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, why couldn't you have changed your mind?  Why insist on going on with the murder of a man, when it was no longer necessary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> In my opinion it was still necessary.  I just confirmed that he is involved, that he did receive  ammunition and I just cleaned up around him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you weren't interested, you were more interested in killing people than in securing evidence and prosecuting them in the lawful manner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> In the instances where the activity of a person was of such prominence, that would be my decision, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does that make your job easier, is that why you were doing that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHA:</span> In the case of where a person, Mr Chairperson, was responsible for acts of terror, in the execution and planning of it, yes it did make our task easier when we eliminated them, because we could then stop the process.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> May the witness be excused Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you.</p>
