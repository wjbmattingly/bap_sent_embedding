Let me encapsulate your evidence as I comprehend it thus far.  You have this meeting which happens at the hills where you usually held your \"People's Courts\", you decide to administer some lashes on the group that you had with you at that time, which did not include Dudu.  You proceed to impose a sentence and you proceed to meet out punishment on that group of people who you estimated to be approximately seven.   You then decide that Dudu must be located, you go back to the house, you search the house, you find Dudu hiding under the bed, you take her up to the hills where you again impose a sentence of 200 lashes on her and proceed to administer that sentence.   At about that time, the comrades from Amadiqwe arrive in a kombi, they then give you some kind of wisdom about the decision that you had earlier on taken, and you then agree that these persons should not only be assaulted as you had already done, but that they should be killed and not only the people who were from outside your area, but those who assisted them which would mean Amos Cele and the people who were staying at his house.  You agree with that decision, as a result of which you go to Amos Cele's house, precisely to carry out the decision that you have now taken jointly with the comrades from Amadiqwe and that is no longer to allow these people to leave, but to kill them and kill those people who had harboured them, that would be Amos Cele and his people.  This is how I have been understanding your evidence.   As it turned out, Amos Cele is not in the house and these people see you coming and they start dispersing in different directions.  You then split into various groups, the others remain behind and they burn down Amos Cele's house.  It is quite obvious to me the way I understand your evidence, that you had decided to kill these persons as advised by the comrades from Amadiqwe and that would include Mr Cele, Mr Amos Cele?

            "CHAIRPERSON",
            "Mr Cele, prior to the commencement of these proceedings, we held discussions with both our Evidence Leader, Ms Thabethe and your lawyer, Mr Molohlanye because we were perturbed that your amnesty application was only with regard to the two acts that have again been confirmed by your lawyer to be based on.  We are assured by Mr Molohlanye that the position has been (indistinct) explained to you, what the effect of the amnesty is and what the requirements thereof are.  We were assured further that you understood that if you do not apply for amnesty as you have done because you deny guilt in respect of the killing of both Martin Ngcobo and Mr Amos Cele,  that this Committee would then not have any jurisdiction at all to hear any of those acts for which you are not seeking amnesty.  We were assured by Mr Molohlanye that this had been explained to you and that you comprehended the situation quite well.  We were particularly concerned because we knew that at the time of applying for amnesty, you were not legally represented and we wanted to make sure that this was brought to your knowledge even before we commenced proceedings to hear your application.  As you have been undoubtedly informed by Mr Molohlanye, this is not a Court of Appeal, this is a very extraordinary and unique process where we only hear offenders who are admitting to having committed offences for which they seek amnesty and for which they allege that there was political motivation and which of course at the end of the day, we must be satisfied that indeed those offences were politically related.  Your request that this Committee should do something in respect of the offences for which you were convicted and sentenced involving the killing of Mr Martin Ngcobo and Amos Cele, you must be aware sir that we are in no position to do anything about that.  We had hoped that that position had been made crystal clear by Mr Molohlanye.",

            "Ms Thabethe, I don't know what your direction will be to this Committee.  We would propose that we proceed to hear evidence of the second applicant in respect of the killing of Amos Cele before you can lead your witnesses in respect of both applicants.  I think that will expedite matters better, than if we were to give you an opportunity now to lead the evidence of the objectors in respect of the offences for which Mr Thulani Cele seeks amnesty.  Are you in agreement with that procedure?",
