I am informed Mr Chairman, that there is a problem with the photocopy machine that is available to us here, but as soon as that becomes available Mr Chairman, we will certainly let you have that.  \n\tMay we suggest Mr Chairman, that that Exhibit might be called Exhibit A, and its description will be a list of politically related incidents in Port Natal.  We might have one copy, pardon me for a moment.  We seem to have two here Mr Chairman, we have handed it to some of our learned friends.
