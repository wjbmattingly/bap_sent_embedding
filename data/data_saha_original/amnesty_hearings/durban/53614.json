Mr du Preez seemed to indicate that this was because of his union activities way back in 1987 and I suggested to Mr du Preez that the letters also pointed to a house in Inanda at which weapons were found.  Mr du Preez obviously claimed that he could not remember any of this until he had read those documents and he couldn't remember any further details of that.  Now, essentially what I need to know from you is are you familiar with that period of time and the circumstances under which Blessing was detained?  Are you able to offer the Committee any further information on this?",

We discussed about this, that it was going to blow our cover in that Inanda, but then we decided to take them.  When they arrived at Inanda, we reported the matter to our offices in Swaziland and we told them that we were staying with them and after a while we heard that someone from Swaziland came to fetch them.  I was staying with Sefiso at Clermont.  We left Clermont for Pietermaritzburg.\n\tWhilst we were in 'Maritzburg, we received a report that police had raided the house at Inanda.  They came together with Ricky Filanda who was staying with the guerillas at Inanda, but Ricky was arrested somewhere near Empangeni together with other boys he had recruited from Empangeni and when he came back with the police, they searched the house, they found the printer which we were using to print the propaganda for the ANC and weapons.  I heard that they went to Blessing Ninela's work and arrested him and questioned him about what they found in that house at Inanda.\n\tAfter a few days we were arrested from Maritzburg, myself and Sefiso.  We were brought to Pinetown police station.  When we were in Pinetown police station whilst they were interrogating us, the police managed to link us to the Inanda house and Blessing as well.

He had requested Sefiso to look after the house and he was staying somewhere else, because Inanda was far from where he was working.  Blessing was not a member of our unit.

            "Yes, certainly, Mr Chairman.  I don't foresee that I will, but if it's necessary, I will do so.\n\tMr Chairman, dealing then with the incident itself, I do similarly not intend to traverse all the evidence that was given, but in brief, the witnesses du Preez and Wasserman told you that they were instructed to meet Mr Taylor, as it turned out, at a shooting range at Winkelspruit, where they met Taylor and some askaris in the company of Mr Ninela.  Col Taylor informed them that Mr Ninela was an activist who had been arrested and that he, that is Taylor, had considered what to do with him and had concluded that he could not charge him, nor could he release him, by virtue of the fact that he would continue with his activities.  They both recall that Mr Taylor had told them that Mr Ninela was responsible for previous explosions in the Natal area and that he was arrested according to their recollection, while in possession of a limpet mine.\n\tYou heard evidence from Mwelase that when Mr Ninela was arrested, he was not possessed of any weapons of any description.  We have no reason to doubt his evidence.  Mr Chairman, the submission we make on that score is that it takes the matter no further, one way or the other, because all that Wasserman and du Preez could tell you was what they heard from Mr Taylor.\n\tMay I deal immediately with the evidence of the last two witnesses, Mr Chairman?  We submit that the only relevance of that evidence is to show that Mr Ninela was not as innocent as might have been suspected when listening to the evidence of his mother, and it's understandable, I don't criticise her at all, for that reason, but it is quite clear that Mr Blessing Ninela was quite involved in activities, political activities, and the one fact that we know for certain is that at one time he had a limpet mine in his possession which he trained the Bhengu brothers on and handed it to them for obvious purposes.  \n\tThe relevance of that Mr Chairman, is it gives colour to what Taylor had told Wasserman and du Preez.  It creates a basis of credibility for what they were told and it also, in our submission, is then easier to understand and to accept when du Preez and Wasserman told you that Taylor was a seasoned policeman and they had no reason at all to doubt his judgment in the matter.  So they simply carried out orders.\n\tMr Chairman there was opposition by family members to the application.  At the inception Ms Gabriel told you that the opposition would fall on two legs.  Firstly that there was no full disclosure, as intended by the Act and secondly that the act was disproportionate to any political objective sought to be achieved.  We make the following submissions immediately from that.  \n\tFirst is that the other requirement of the Act namely that the act, omission or offence had to be associated with a political objective, has not been challenged before you and indeed we submit that it is quite clear that it has been established, particularly within the context, Chairperson of the general background which we argued to you and I can't refer to a specific page because really the whole document deals with it.\n\tSecondly, Mr Chairman, you would have noticed that my learned friend, Ms Gabriel did not direct any cross-examination nor put any statements to either du Preez or Wasserman in regard to proportionality.  Again we submit that it is understandable, when viewing proportionality as the Act charges us to do, Mr Chairman within the context of the conflict of the past, this particular matter certainly must pass that test of proportionality and for that statement, for that submission we rely on previous amnesty applications and decisions handed down by various amnesty committees.  \n\tOf course, Mr Chairman, the killing of one single human being is always disproportionate and that is clearly why the Act has defined that the proportionality spoken about in Section 20 sub-section 3 has to be adjudicated within the context of the conflict of the past.  So viewed Chairperson, we submit that that requirement has also been satisfied.  \n\tThat leaves us on the opposition side Mr Chairman, with a question of full disclosure.  Now the issue of full disclosure relates to all relevant facts, says the Act in Section 20 sub (i) sub (c).  Now Mr Chairman, Ms Gabriel put questions in this regard to the witnesses, both du Preez and Wasserman and she started off by suggesting that there are many unanswered questions and when you limited my learned friend to tell us, to put directly what precisely was withheld, she made the following suggestions, (1) that there was a definite relationship between the Security Branch and Mr Ninela (2) that the statements relating to Mr Ninela's union activities were not divulged by the applicants and thirdly Mr Chairman, as we understood it, there was criticism on the basis that the information which is now before the Committee should really have been placed before, not by the family, but by the applicants.\n\tDealing with those very briefly  in turn, we submit as follows.  Wasserman and du Preez told you that they had no relationship with Mr Ninela.  As it turned out and Wasserman conceded this, is that he may have been present, or may have been the person who arrested Mr Ninela because he told - did I say Wasserman?  I mean du Preez, because he told you Mr Chairman, at the time there was a group of people who were arrested and lists were given out to various police officers to assist in the arrests to, as you know from experience, when a group of people had to be arrested, it was always attempted to do so around and about the same time so that warnings could not go out and so on and he said to you that as far as he remembers, he would have arrested him merely on a list and a name, without knowing anything about the background.\n\tNow Mr Chairman, in fact this alleged relationship between the Security Branch and Mr Ninela also is contradicted by the evidence of Mrs Ninela who said that a week after his arrest, she had gone to C R Swart Square police station and asked to see her son, where a uniformed policeman told her that he was suspected of MK activities, which in our submission clearly points to the fact that the CID was busy with him and not necessarily Mr du Preez.  If I'm not correct with that submission Mr Chairman, I would refer you to what Mr Blessing Ninela himself says in regard to the Security Branch.  He says, Mr Chairman, at page 71 of bundle 2 at the bottom that, this is in a memorandum written to the Minister, that he was arrested on the 23rd, taken to C R Swart Square and he says there he was severely assaulted by a group of white security officers, \"one of whom introduced himself as Mr du Preez.\"  Now the question is how far does Mr du Preez, on the assumption of the correctness of this, how far does his association with Mr Ninela run and we can adjudicate that by looking at what he then says.  He says,  \"Mr du Preez informed me on the 25th of January\" so that is the 23rd to the 25th and in that time on two occasions apparently, might be more, on his recollection du Preez had something to do with him.  On the 25th of January he was informed that he was being detained under the Internal Security Act Section 29.  Then other people take over Mr Chairman.  Then he goes on to say:\n\"He, Mr du Preez and the other security members, that is Basson, de Wet and Krause, told me they have reason to believe that I have knowledge of terrorists and arms found in the Inanda house, in the house at Inanda\"\nand then Mr Chairman, he is transferred to Pinetown and it would appear from his statement that that's the last, on his own show, that du Preez has anything to do with him, is when he was told that he was suspected on the 25th, because then apparently a Capt Krause took over, Mr Chairman, as we read the statement.  \n\tNow, the point I'm making here is that on the evidence before you, there does not appear to be independent evidence to corroborate the allegation that there was this relationship which my learned friend spoke about between the Security Forces and Mr Ninela.  When asked in evidence about that du Preez said there was no, he has no recollection of him having even been aware of Mr Ninela as an important person in their investigations and we would ask you to accept that Mr Chairman.  But, Mr Chairman, the question would be, what is the relevance to your decision whether amnesty is to be granted or not, whether or not there was a special relationship and we would submit, none.  If the evidence had been, Taylor called us out, he told us about Ninela, but we knew about this before, that would not have changed the situation at all, Mr Chairman.  That would not, in fact it would have made it better for the applicants, in all probability if that had been their evidence, but it isn't.   \n\tSo we say, Mr Chairman, the first point of deliberately withholding information does not hold water.  Then the question of these union activities, du Preez told you that he and Wasserman were in the Intelligence Department in the terrorist section, they had nothing to do with union activities.  Sure, there were weapons found in a house which might have brought it under the auspices of the terrorist unit, but du Preez and Wasserman say they know nothing about that.  Again, Mr Chairman, it is not a relevant fact.  Then Mr Chairman, on the issue of the information which came to hand last week Thursday, now both these witnesses, du Preez as well as Wasserman, are retired police officers, they have no access to documentation with the police.  If we had been confronted with this documentation, and this is not a complaint but a matter of fact, earlier, my attorney might have perhaps made inquiries, Mr Chairman.  We were quite unaware that Mr Ninela had been arrested.  Had we known, we might have made inquiries to see whether there was a Section 29 statement for example, etc.  But we did not have that time, we had only Friday which was insufficient time to do a full investigation and apart from that Mr Chairman, Wasserman told you that du Preez and him went and pointed out the scene of the crime and later gave evidence, that is in January 1997 and in July 1997.  They were, he was, Wasserman says he was under the impression that the TRC investigation unit was investigating this matter thoroughly.  \n\tNow that brings two consequences with it, Mr Chairman.  The one is, once the TRC investigation unit is busy with investigations, it would be inappropriate, to say the least for applicants to do their own investigation in the light thereof.  We had this once before, Mr Chairman, where we specifically asked for permission to do certain investigations which we believed the investigation unit of the TRC should have done and didn't do and that was a special request we made and his Lordship Justice Miller, sitting as the Chairman of that Committee, that was in the Stanza Bopape matter, gave us the permission.  But secondly, Mr Chairman, is it so unreasonable to believe or to think, in the shoes of Wasserman and du Preez, that the matter was now being investigated properly?  We submit not, Mr Chairman and therefore on the arguments presented, or the questions put by Ms Gabriel on the issue of non full disclosure, we say that it holds no water, but apart from that, we asked the representative of the family, Mrs Ninela, what does she say what was held back and Mr Chairman you asked her quite a few questions about that, at the end of which it appears that they have a suspicion that there might be something else, but they don't know.  We say, Mr Chairman, full disclosure in this matter of relevant facts is the three persons coming forward, Taylor, Wasserman and du Preez to tell you that they participated in the killing of Blessing Ninela.  As far as the finer detail is concerned, sure as one would expect there is some measure of dispute, not dispute perhaps dissention, difference, but that does not make it a non disclosure of the relevant facts.  We would ask you Chairperson, to find that also, in that regard, the applicants have satisfied you that they have made a fully disclosure.  There is certainly nothing in their evidence which is inherently so improbable that their evidence should be rejected and consequently Mr Chairman, we ask you that on that basis alone, amnesty should be favourably considered.\n\tMr Chairman, the evidence of Mr Bhengu, I've already addressed you on and perhaps I've already made the point sufficiently, Mr Chairman, but both him as well as Mr Ngobese's evidence, really relate to issues which fall outside the scope of your inquiry here because it deals with matters beforehand.  \n\tOne matter, Mr Chairman, which remains and which I need to address you upon, is the question of differences between the evidence of du Preez and Wasserman on the one hand and the evidence of Mr Taylor. \n\tNow Mr Chairman, Mr Nel has been from the beginning, the attorney who acted for Col Taylor.  In the hearing concerning various matters which we refer to as the Ndwandwe hearing, at page 731, when Col Botha is giving evidence, Mr Nel put to him the following.  Just below half of the page.  \"I could put it to you\" - well, my attorney says I must start reading from the top of the page.\n\"And you heard the evidence of Mr Wasserman who testified that he had personal knowledge of Mr Taylor's bad memory and you had something to say about that too.\nBotha says, \"That is correct.\"\nThe Mr Nel says, \"And if we have,\"  I'm not going to read that Mr Chairman, I'm going to go to just below half the page where Mr Nel says,\n\"I could put it to you that during, when he drew up the amnesty application with Adv Botha and myself, Col Taylor had very bad problems with his memory and he could not remember certain things.\"\nNow that accords with the evidence as we understand it, of people who knew what the position or the condition of Mr Taylor was at the end of his days.  Now, Mr Chairman, against that background, I would refer you to bundle 1 page 4 where Mr Taylor deals with the killing of Blessing Ninela.  Now why it's necessary perhaps to deal with this in this fashion, Mr Chairman, is that my learned friend Ms Gabriel, has put it to the witnesses that they agree with what Taylor says only in so far as it suits them and only in so far as it supports their applications for amnesty.  I will demonstrate to you Mr Chairman, that that is far from the truth.  If you go through what he says, Mr Chairman, Taylor says: \t\n\"the aforementioned was an ANC activist, who was arrested on a mission to Natal.\"\nNow first of all, Chairman, you will immediately observe the difference in the recollection  of du Preez and Wasserman on the other hand.  They were under the impression, I'm not quite sure what Wasserman said, but du Preez was under the impression that Taylor told them that he was arrested while he was in possession of a limpet mine.  I think Wasserman said something slightly different, but it matters not.  \n\"On a mission, being the placing of bombs, myself, Sam du Preez and Laurrie Wasserman realised, on questioning him, that there was no evidence against him which we could take to court although he himself admitted that his mission was the placing of bombs.  I decided that the only solution in this case would be to kill him.\"\nThen he says: \n\"We drove him to a railway line\"\nand further down he says:\n\"They, that is du Preez and Wasserman, were instructed to kill him and blow up his body to make it appear as if he blew himself up.\"\nNow if du Preez's attitude was to rely only on the portions of Taylor's evidence which supported his version, in order to obtain amnesty, one must ask yourself, why did he differ from this opinion, from this evidence expressed by Taylor?  Because Taylor takes it upon himself that he told them to kill and blow up Blessing Ninela.  No, says du Preez, he's recollection's different.  He says he thinks that he decided about that.  Now on the probabilities Mr Chairman, it's not difficult to believe and I think Commissioner Lax put a question along those lines to du Preez, it's not difficult to - and Commissioner Bosman as well,  to believe that Taylor in fact told them to blow him up, it's not difficult to believe that.  So if du Preez wanted to be dishonest about it, and wanted to ride on the back of the dead as it was put to them, then this was his chance, Mr Chairman, which he never took and we say that that shows that there is nothing in that suggestion made by my learned friend.  But Mr Chairman, Wasserman and Du Preez told you that they believe that Taylor was confused with another incident.  That incident Mr Chairman, Taylor describes - Oh, I'm told you haven't got it before you Mr Chairman, which is a pity. relating to the killing of three unknown activists.  Perhaps I should just read it to you Mr Chairman.  He says, and this refers to the kwaMashu 3 and I will give you further references in a moment.\n\"I recall that on occasion I arrived at a farm in the Verulam area where Henti Botha was based, carrying on operations against terrorists.\"\nSo far so good.\n\"I was informed that they had three people that they detained who had admitted that they were involved in terrorist activities.\"\nAs you will see in a moment that is entirely incorrect, in a certain sense, but I'll come to that.\n\"And that it had been decided that these people were to be killed due to the fact that there was no admissible evidence available against them.  Subsequently we left from the farm and Botha, Sam du Preez and Laurrie Wasserman and other members whose identities I cannot remember, took the people out and went with them in the direction of a railway line in the vicinity of Verulam.  A while later they returned and the next day I heard that there had been an explosion on the railway line\"\nWhich is not correct, Mr Chairman as I'll point out in a moment.\n\t\t\"I have no personal knowledge as to whether the people were killed\"\nThat's also entirely incorrect,\n\"but assume that they were blown up on the railway line and that this was the explosion I heard about.\"\n\tNow Mr Chairman, Wasserman and du Preez say they believe that's the incident which is confused here.  Now if you look at the evidence in regard to that matter presented by Botha in the Ndwandwe amnesty application page 707 and I would read it to you Mr Chairman.  Botha says this:\n\"Chairperson, we made contact with a unit in kwaMashu and one of the informers there infiltrated the unit in order to find information  to the identity, their logistics, their infrastructure and so forth.  he won their trust and they trusted him with information for planned operations.  On 18th November 1988 he reported that the railway line at Phoenix was targeted.\"\nNow Commissioner Lax asked pertinently, this pertinent question, \"Why take Ninela to Bulwer, while previously you did the same thing to others at Verulam, much closer?\"  So, the point here is that the railway line at Phoenix was targeted.  Then Mr Chairman, Mr Visser:\n\"At that date, is that the 18th, is that correct, that the identification occurred?\nMr Botha,\t\"That is correct.\"\nThen he continues:\n\"Arrangements were made with the informer that he would lead the unit to a specific place where we could arrest him\"\nand then Mr Chairman, what is important:\n\"Me, du Preez and Wasserman waited for them at the Avoca bridge.  We expected 4 members, only 3 turned up.  That made it necessary, Mr Chairman, that these three activists be killed at the spot which they themselves identified because otherwise a 4th person would have immediately known had they been killed at another location.\"\nOver the page, Mr Chairman, we ask:\n\"Who were they\"\nand it's stated:\n\t\t\"Sibosiso Ndlovu, Manzi Vilikazi and Elias Gift Ntjali\"\nNow they were the three people killed, Mr Chairman.\n\"What did you do there at the Avoca bridge?\"\n\t\t\"We arrested them and we went, we transported them with a kombi to a safe-house\"\nHe tells us that that's the same safe-house where Ngobeso was kept, and I ask him:\n\"Was there anyone there, when you got there?\"\n\t\t\"Taylor waited for us at the safe-house.  At the safe-house we questioned the three of them.\"\nNow you will recall Taylor says that in Ninela's matter, Wasserman and du Preez questioned Ninela with him, which they say they didn't and they said that he's confusing it with the kwaMashu 3.  Here is the evidence, Mr Chairman.  There they all questioned him.  Then I ask:\n\"When you arrested them, or captured them, did they have anything with them?\"\n\t\t\"Yes, Chairperson, they were in possession of 3 SPM limpet mines with the detonators.  The limpet mines were not armed.\"\n\t\t\"Where were these limpet mines?\"\n\t\t\"They were in a carry bag.\"\nMr Chairman, that deals with two issues where it is quite clear that Taylor was confused.  The last issue you will find at page 714 of the evidence, at the bottom of the page where Botha says:\n\"Everyone, me, du Preez and Wasserman\"\nI'm sorry, that makes no sense, you've got to read the previous statement, he says they were each armed with a Scorpion, everyone, him, du Preez and Wasserman, then he goes on:\n\"Whilst Taylor stayed at the kombi, we took the three of them out of the kombi, removed the cuffs and each of us took them by the arm or by the trousers or by the shirt, I cannot remember where, and we walked in the direction of the railway line and thereafter they were asked to identify the spot which they did and they were there killed.\"\nSo, the third point is, Mr Taylor was present at that time.",

            "I submit that the application for amnesty should be successful in this matter.  The reason for that is being that the abduction was done under the orders from either Myeza, or Col Taylor, this was elicited in evidence.  The political objectives sought by the applicant abducting the deceased was in furtherance of the objectives of his commanding officers, being the maintainers of the security of the Government of South Africa and the action was against a possible enemy of the state at that time.\n\tThe abduction clearly falls in the context of the struggles of the past.  I think this is beyond dispute.  There has been full disclosure on all the aspects.  This is confirmed by the other applicants who acknowledge the abduction by the askaris and Mrs Ninela herself who confirms the applicant's version in that the applicant was at the house, he did drop off a note.  Even the contents of the note were verified.  That was the meeting in Pinetown.  There was doubt as to the time, but I submit that's irrelevant for the purposes.\n\tThe applicant's version of the drop-off point of the abducted person, Blessing Ninela in Port Shepstone, the other applicants refer to that as a shooting range.  The other applicants also confirm that Mr Mwelase was not a member of the team that murdered Blessing Ninela.  In actual fact they confirm that he wasn't there at all.\n\tMr Chairperson, with all due respect, Mr Mwelase hasn't changed in any meaningful aspect.  The applicant was an employee of the state, even if that was under the auspices of the Security Police as it was then.  It is clear that the applicant had no autonomy of his own and acted under orders.  He verified it was either Col de Kock at one stage which is ... (indistinct) for these purposes, or Col Taylor and in fact the applicant never knew of the death of Col Taylor until now.  Even though the applicant may not have believed it was legal, he nevertheless believed that it was with authority and therefore in the course of his duty.

            "Mr Chairman on two matters, Mr du Preez had been implicated, the one is assaulting Mr Ninela at a previous arrest in 1987 and the other as having pretended to be an attorney in order to question Mr Bengu.  Well, Mr Chairman, the evidence of Mr Bhengu is weak in that regard and it is denied.  Mr du Preez could not remember even the incident of the arrest of Mr Ninela and consequently he couldn't deny that he ever assaulted him.  What he did say is that he certainly can't remember it.  That's the furthest a witness in that position can do Mr Chairman and we submit that you would find in both these instances that insufficient evidence has been brought before you in order to make a finding that he in fact did either assault Mr Ninela or pretend to be an attorney.  And secondly, Mr Chairman, again we say that, with respect, that has nothing to do with the present application and the ambit within which you move.\n\tMr Chairman, the other issue which I neglected to mention on the point of whether there were other alternatives which Taylor could have followed and the question of the limpet mine either being in possession of Mr Ninela or not found later etc is this, certainly the Committee will consider the evidence to scrutinise whether an applicant before you in his evidence had not given evidence which is so illogical and inherently improbable that you cannot accept his evidence and you have to draw the inference that he attempted to mislead you.  That is one issue, but of course one must not confuse oneself by thinking that in all these cases it was necessary in order to obtain amnesty that the person had to consider alternatives.  That certainly is not the spirit of the Act, in fact Mr Chairman, it has been expressed as follows in the past.  The applicant is not here to justify his actions, far from it, he committed a crime and part of his crime might well be that he should have prosecuted rather than to kill the man, in fact in most cases it will probably be like that Mr Chairman and I just wanted to make that point and then lastly the point which I forget is the point that Mr du Preez made on the issue of the limpet mine and where Taylor might have got it from when he handed Ninela over to him and Wasserman.  He says that \"For all I know, if I have to speculate, Taylor could have assaulted the man.  In fact there is an allegation by the one witness here that he was assaulted by Taylor.  Taylor could have assaulted the man to point out the limpet mine in which event again one would then say, well under those circumstances, can he now take the man and have him prosecuted through the normal channels?  Also Mr Chairman, we don't know exactly when Mr Ninela had been arrested and how long he had already been held unlawfully after the abduction.  All these matters.  Mr Taylor could have told us, could have filled us in on, Mr Chairman, and the difficulty which you and we have is that he is unfortunately not here in order to assist with these matters but I ask you not to hold it then against Wasserman and du Preez and their evidence.

            "The first is that the problem in this case as we suggested was with full disclosure.  Full disclosure is not necessarily limited to just a portrayal of the relevant facts, but as was apparent from my cross-examination, full disclosure in this case must mean something more than selective disclosure.\n\tLet me start with the application of the 4th applicant.  At this point the family wishes to state quite clearly that they have no opposition to the amnesty application of the 4th respondent, 4th applicant, pardon me.  They are satisfied that he has made a full disclosure and that his objectives at the time were proportionally related to the instructions that he had received.  His versions of events have been consistent and they were made at the earliest possible opportunity.  As against that we have two versions set apart by some two and a half years submitted by the second applicant and the third applicant.  \n\tWhat's interesting in these applications is that they seek to distinguish their earlier versions about not recalling detail and suddenly in the second application recall a massive amount of detail when confronted with evidence by the family, seem to recall it and then when confronted by questioning recall even more details including what we were thinking at the time.\n\tSo apart from distinguishing the fact that they could not remember earlier, they also seek to distinguish Taylor's version.  They point out that Taylor gave them the order.  They point out that Taylor was mistaken in believing that, and I quote: \n\"Myself, du Preez and Laurrie Wasserman realised on questioning him that there was no evidence which we could take to court, although he himself admitted that his mission was the placing of bombs.\"\nThe question is why?  Why seek to distinguish these other aspects of Taylor's evidence?  On Taylor's version we see that the objective was to eliminate, not because of a lack of evidence, not merely because of a lack of evidence, but not because this man was suspected to be of serious and imminent danger, suspected to be a terrorist, but that is Taylor's version and he is dead and we will never know.  By seeking to distinguish this, what the applicants have done is to extract themselves out of all complicity in the planning and in the execution of Ninela's death.  \n\tWhat they have done is to confine themselves very clearly to the limited ambit of taking instructions and the minute they do that they are exonerated from having to explain the basis of their actions.  They are exonerated from having to explain whether the manner in which they reacted at that point, was justifiable and proportional in the circumstances.  So that, on my submission, is really the basis on which they seek to distinguish Taylor's  evidence.\n\tNow the explanation we are given, one of the explanations we are given is that Taylor had a bad memory.  If that is so, it is highly unlikely that he would remember detail.  It is highly unlikely that he would remember that the applicants were in fact with him.  It is more probable that a man suffering from lack of memory or bad memory would in fact remember very little.",

So my submission is that the act of distinguishing this evidence, has been designed to protect them from answering any further questions.  Now I want to point out Mr Chairman that the applicants are bringing an application for amnesty for the killing of a citizen of this country.  There is no onus on the mother of that man, that deceased man, to convince you that the applicants are lying.  The onus is on the applicants to present a full disclosure so that the reasons for his death not just the manner of his death, are well understood.  \n\tThe witnesses led by the family clearly establish that there were very solid grounds on which Mr Ninela could have been prosecuted.  Both with respect to the death of the Bengu, son of Bengu and secondly with respect to the presence of weapons at the house in Inanda.  That has never been a dispute and the witnesses led by the family were very very clear that he was implicated in that.  The problem is on the versions presented by the applicants, and that is, we were following orders, they do not come up to be challenged against that.  All we can do is perhaps now at this stage, to question Taylor who is dead.  That particular aspect can never be challenged.  So I would point out that the full disclosure emanates not so much from the fact that Mrs Ninela couldn't point to aspects of their evidence that were missing, but from the fact that at the earliest possible opportunity, they could not remember.  When they could remember, they remembered enough to distinguish and when they did remember it was a very selective disclosure.  They would reveal and did reveal no more than was necessary to support the version that they were carrying out orders.  Subsequently when the family had access to the amplified application and compared it with the first application, they realised that there was more than met the eye in these applications and on that basis went out and secured the further information, which then was presented to the applicants and suddenly they could remember.\n\tIf I may just move through specific points in the evidence of the second and third applicants.  Apart from the obvious contradictions with Taylor, what I point out as significant and I submit is significance is this miraculous burst of memory in the intervening two and a half year period.  Minute details are recalled, such as the fact that he was apparently picked up with a limpet mine, they remember details of who shot and who blew him up, they remembered details of, Wasserman recalls details of what he was thinking at the time, he was thinking when du Preez blew him up that this is a good thing, because people then will not identify him and believe that he has gone to Swaziland.  How is it then that such minute detail can be recalled at this very, very late stage?\n\tIn evidence and under cross-examination Wasserman says he did not talk to Taylor before preparing his first application.  Both of the first applications incorporate paragraphs from Taylor's application and I refer the Committee to pages 20 and 36 of the first bundle.  It is clear that these applications were made at the same time and in concert.",

            "I want to suggest that it's highly improbable that they would not have spoken to Taylor before making the application given that they were all applying for the same set of events and for the same sets of killings and given the fact that they subsequently realised that Taylor had in fact made several mistakes.  On this - my basic submission is that the amnesty applications and this has been the basis of the family's objection, the amnesty applications have limited the disclosure of what they knew and how they were involved to aspects on which they know they cannot be questioned on.  For as long as they distinguish Taylor's evidence, they do not have to justify the proportionality, they do not have to justify any personal knowledge of Ninela.  At that point they can simply remember, yes, well perhaps I met him in prison, but du Preez then is forced to say that Ninela is lying about the torture because he doesn't want to reveal that there was in fact a prior relationship between them.\n\tEven if my submission is rejected on that score, I submit that there are still problems with the versions presented by the applicants.  If the order was to execute, if as they say, the order came from Taylor to execute, why desecrate the body?  Why blow up the head?  Why blow up the hands?  We had du Preez who said one of the purposes in blowing him up was to serve as a deterrent.  If indeed they were blowing up an MK soldier, they would want that presumably to be known the ANC.  Wasserman says that he thought that the explosive was a good idea because then no identity would be possible and people would think that he had left to Swaziland.  How is it then that on Mwelase's evidence, Taylor had the same belief, or fed Mwelase the same story that Ninela was in Swaziland?  I want to suggest that this was part of a much broader plan and that Wasserman's sudden recollection points at some measure, to a much more organised and deliberate execution of Mr Ninela than we are given to believe.\n\tDu Preez, having distinguished Taylor's evidence, states in his second application that he had not personal knowledge of Ninela's activities.  That is what prompted the family to go out and investigate and that is what prompted the family and the investigators to discover that indeed there were documents that showed a very traumatic and a very early relationship between du Preez and Ninela.  Even so, du Preez seeks to distinguish the references to torture.  There is no reason for Ninela to have falsely implicated du Preez.  The problem is that du Preez must now stick to his version that he couldn't recall Ninela and to the extent that he could recall him, well he wasn't an exceptional personality.  If anything the documents show not that it's directly relevant now on their version, but the documents show that the legal machinery was partly employed and that it could have continued to be employed against Mr Ninela.  \n\tI submit that on the evidence that has been placed by both sides, the entire modus operandi surrounding the death of Mr Ninela is strange.  On the evidence presented and as the evidence recalled by the applicants, the profile of Ninela is not that of an ANC military operator.  It's not that of an ANC terrorist.

Section 20 (i)(c) says\n\"If the Committee, after considering an application for amnesty is satisfied that the applicant has made a full disclosure of all relevant facts, it shall grant amnesty.\"\nMy learned friend can't extend the provisions and requirements of the Act, Mr Chairman.  \n\tSecondly Mr Chairman, my learned friend says that, apparently departs from the point of view, I should say, that what the applicants must show is that this was a terrorist, and that he was an eminent danger to society etc etc, well, that's not necessary, Mr Chairman.  And we know that because the whole of Section 20 sub-section (ii) deals with that and Section 22 (b) which is the relevant sub-section Mr Chairman, talks of any member of the Security Forces, leaving out unnecessary words, \n\"Forces, any member of the Security Forces who acts within the scope of his express or implied authority directed against a publicly known political organisation or liberation movement engaged etc, etc or against members of supporters of such organisation or movement and which was committed bona fide with the object of countering or otherwise resisting the said struggle...\"\nNow that was the evidence and that is sufficient Mr Chairman.  We don't have to prove that Mr Ninela was a terrorist.  \n\tMy learned friend said that there's an onus on the applicants, Mr Chairman, I don't want to go through that argument again, with respect, no decision has been handed down, but quite clearly the argument has been accepted that there is no question of onuses in an inquiry such as this before you and you deal with matters which you find have been established whatever way, Mr Chairman.\n\tMy learned friend makes a point of remembering nothing at the time when the amnesty applications were signed and now suddenly and miraculously remembering all the detail, all this finer detail which includes who shot, who blew him up, etc.  Now Mr Chairman, we submit it's an exaggerated submission.  It starts with a wrong premise.  The wrong premise would be, as I've already argued that they knew nothing about this incident when they signed the original application form.  That is not the evidence.  They told  you that they had difficulty in distinguishing various events and the victims, Mr Chairman, and that is what they wanted to establish.  With great respect, my learned friend is departing from the point of view that they knew nothing then and then suddenly out of the blue they had all this information is not based on the evidence before you.  \n\t\"Why blow them up?\" asks my learned friend.  Mr Chairman, you perhaps gave a better answer than I could and that is that the motivations of people who acted the way they did  in the time of strife during the conflict, can't now be judged by lawyers sitting in a quiet room, particularly with an armchair approach.  As was testified to before the Human Rights Violations Committee and I believe Mr Lax was a Commissioner at the time, or a member of that  Committee, by APLA, by the ANC, by everybody to say that we acted in that time on the spur of the moment, we didn't have time to reconsider.  We, thinking back today, we would never have done that, thinking back about it clearly, now they say, Mr Chairman, they thought they had to cover their tracks.  Now what is so wrong with that?  And the way to stop identification although it is cruel and crude, is to take away a man's face and to take away his fingerprints.  Now there's nothing special about that, Mr Chairman, with great respect, we can disagree with it and we can be abhorred by it, but it doesn't take away the fact that it is so.\n\tMr Chairman, again this matter of should have been prosecuted was brought up.  One must just think, Mr Chairman, and this was perhaps the reason why Mr Bhengu's evidence was presented here, in order to show you that the police had a clear case against Mr Ninela, well, was it such a clear case?  If they wanted to prosecute Mr Ninela because of the limpet mine he had handed to the Bhengu brothers, who would they have used as a witness?  This witness that gave evidence here today?  That would have been the one and only star witness.  Would he have been prepared coming from the background where he came from, to go and give evidence against his friend and comrade Mr Ninela?  We submit on the probabilities not, Mr Chairman.",

            "Well, Mr Chairman, that is part of the conflict of the past.  Many people on both sides were killed for less reasons than we today would do far less to persons.  That is the reality of the situation, Mr Chairman.  Yes, when one thinks about it on the basis of normal society, the killing of one person, as I said before, is unjustifiable, but what we're talking about here, Mr Chairman and you'll remember the case of Steyn who received amnesty as the ultimate example, where he was given instructions to take a man to hospital.  He then decided that he's been looking for this man for so long, he's not going to go through that terrible ordeal again.  He takes him behind a bush and he shoots him.  Now those were the terrible facts of our past Mr Chairman, which the Interim Constitution charges us to reconcile with each other through the process of amnesty and it is sometimes difficult, of course it is, but those are the realities, Mr Chairman.\n\tMr Chairman, just to put one matter straight.  My learned friend seems to assume that Mr Taylor, because he's amnesty application went in the same time as du Preez and Wasserman, did that in cahoots or together with Wasserman.  It's not true.  Wasserman and du Preez did their amnesty applications through attorneys Wagener and Muller in Pretoria, while Mr Taylor did his through Mr Nel.  Mr Nel can confirm that, Mr Chairman.\n\tNow my learned friend says that du Preez was forced to deny that he assaulted Ninela.  Well that is not his evidence.  He says that he can't remember and he can take it no further than that.  For a man who can't remember, he can't say, Mr Chairman.\n\tNow we find it very strange that my learned friend says that after they heard what the applicant said, they went to do research and they found the documents which they placed before you.  Now referring to those documents, Mr Chairman, you heard my learned friend say this morning that the brother of Mr Ninela wishes to come and give evidence to say that the applications for the release of Mr Ninela was within his custody, so that would suppose, with Mr Chairman, that he had it all along.  It wouldn't have been something which he had gone to look for now because of anything that the applicant said, with great respect. \n\tYes, so to round up, Mr Chairman, it is not for the applicant to show that Mr Ninela was anything more than what my learned friend refers to as a sympathiser.  We prefer to refer to as a supporter of a political organisation and with that Mr Chairman, I again repeat my request that you consider the applications favourably.",
