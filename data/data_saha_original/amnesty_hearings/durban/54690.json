Mr Chairman, we have been instructed by the South African Defence Force that they, in this matter, the training of certain people in the Caprivi by the Defence Force, would be in issue.  It is not disputed by the Defence Force that those people were trained in fact, although it is disputed that it was with a malicious intent.\n\tThe notification was sent by fax to the South African National Defence Force (indistinct), and they have informed us that although Brigadier Van Niekerk, Colonel Swart and Colonel Breytenbach are mentioned in the papers, that they were unable to trace those people, and accordingly they have not received notice.\n\tFurthermore they wish to place on record that the documents were only received by the Defence Force on the 2nd of April 1998 and in the available time, they couldn't trace the persons mentioned.  However, our instructions are just to place this on record, and not at this stage to ask for an adjournment or anything, but just to reserve the rights if necessary.\n\tThen there is also mentioned by the South African Defence Force that one Cloete and one J.P. Opperman who testified  in what is now commonly known as the Magnus Malan trial, were also erstwhile members of the Defence Force, were also implicated in this matter, and these two persons we know as a fact, did not receive indemnity against prosecution, but  they haven't been notified by the Defence Force either.\n\tIt is apparent that they are also mentioned.

Kindly note the following:  (1) the applicants in this matter were members of the so-called Caprivi trainees, this group was thoroughly investigated during 1992 to 1993 by the Goldstone Commission when certain allegations were made inter alia against individual members of the South African Police, who are clients of ours.  During 1997 the human rights violations committee also conducted a hearing dealing with the subject, and where we represented amongst others the following individuals, Mr A.J. Vlok, General P.J. Coetzee, General J.V. van der Merwe, Major General J.A.P. Berger, Major General G.N. Erasmus, Major General B. Steyn and Brigadier A. Laas.\n\tParagraph 3, I have now received the present applications herein and have noted that not one of the above-mentioned clients are specifically mentioned or implicated therein.  However, I have been approached by Mr Steenkamp and Mr Peens, who are mentioned in the applications with a request to protect their interest in this regard.\n\tAs you have already once again failed to comply with the provision of Section 19(4), we find it impossible to do so in a proper way.  I am going to address that one, Mr Chairman, as they are not directly implicated, my instructions are not to appear before you on their behalf, but to put on record that should their rights in any way be infringed upon, we expect to be notified immediately in order for us to respond in an appropriate way.\n\tSome of the applicants herein also apply for amnesty in respect of crimes committed as part of the so-called Black Cats of Ermelo.  As you are aware, we represent certain individual Policemen who have in the past, falsely been implicated in this regard.\n\tIn the present applications they are not directly implicated, but should that become the position at your hearing, their rights are also specifically reserved.  The same applies in respect of my clients mentioned in paragraph 1.2 above.  These are the names I have just mentioned.\n\tYou are kindly requested to read this letter into the record at the commencement of your hearing on the 6th of April 1998.  Signed by Jan Wagenaar.",

We note from the documentation given to us, that the information contained in the various affidavits submitted by the applicants together with their applications, that - just bear with me - that 56 incidents have been identified and are contained in the schedule.\n\tI am not sure if that contains each and every incident in respect of which all the applicants are intending to apply for amnesty, because in the application form it is merely said in response to the question, in respect of which incidents are you applying for amnesty, it just refers to the affidavit which is - all of them are voluminous excepting in one instance, affidavits.\n\tI would then request when we are dealing with matters that are not involved in actual incidents, or which have already been identified, or which will be identified by those representing the applicants, that if we can keep the evidence of matters outside that, as brief as possible and not go into too much detail.\n\tI don't know if there is any application, because it is not specified, relating for instance to the training of the persons in Caprivi.  Now, obviously you will be referring to that, it is quite evident from Mr Luthuli's affidavit, but I would request if possible, to keep the detail out of that and keep it as short as possible without placing any undue hinderance on the presentation of your case, if you could just keep that in mind because I think we have ahead of us a very long hearing and we would like to use our time as sufficiently as possible.

His home is Mzimela, that is his place of origin, an area that is under Chief Mzimela at Empangeni and other Caprivians helped him to kill many people in Empangeni.  The very same Mzimela about whom I am talking here.\n\tHe is actually the one who was supplying people with AK47's, and he got them from the Boers because there were no other friends of his apart from the Boers.\n\tNow, I would refer to Prince Gideon Zulu.  He was my neighbour from where I stayed.  I think it was a third house from my place at Ulundi.\n\tI don't know how many times I went to his place to drink beer and celebrate with him.  I used to attend rallies with him, the IFP rallies.\n\tI also accompanied him to the King's celebration in his African regalia.  I was with him at a meeting where (indistinct) Mkhize were given a government car.  That very same car that was issued by M.R. Mzimela, issuing it out as a State car in my presence, and this car was given to (indistinct) Mkhize who was with Romeo in my presence.\n\tNow, Gideon Zulu on the day when he told me that there is a person at Eshowe, a man who was apparently a male nurse, he was working at a hospital, a man who was a relative to the Kraal, that is the Kingship at Nongoma, this person had to be killed.  I was present there as well.\n\tBrigadier Mzimela is a Chief or a Headman at Sikhawini, even though I have forgotten the name of the place.  \n\tIf there were Inkatha meetings, he would take off his Police hat and put it aside, and he would become a Headman and he would also become an IFP member.\n\tHe was working very close with (indistinct) Mkhize.  That is Brigadier Mzimela.\n\tMrs Mbuyasi was or she is a member of the IFP Central Committee, while at the same time she is in the Womens' Brigade of the IFP.\n\tAlso she is occupying a top position in the IFP at eSikahwini.  She is also a teacher, I do not hesitate about that.\n\tLet us now refer to M.R. Mkhize.  M.R. Mkhize is the one in charge of the IFP office at Empangeni.  Zweli Dhlamini was the one who was a body guard, that is M.R. Mkhize's body guard at Empangeni.\n\tLastly Mthetwa, Joyful Mthetwa is also a Caprivian.  He resides in Nseleni.  Nseleni is known to be an IFP stronghold.  Any UDF member does not even get astray into that area, because of the presence of Joyful at Nseleni.\n\tTherefore everything that I am saying about him, is as I have stated in the document, thank you very much.",
