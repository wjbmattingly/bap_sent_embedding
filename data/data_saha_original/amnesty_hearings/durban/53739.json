These people were carrying heavy calibre firearms and weapons.  My client, and I were not here last week, we understand that there was some type of arrangement or agreement that was reached between the Commission and the applicants regarding protection and bodyguards and for the sake of my clients who were not here, we would like the Commission basically, if possible, to clear up what the position is with regards the use of firearms in and around the vicinity of the building.

            "Before I read out my statement, I wish to state that I have already served a sentence for most of the activities detailed in the amnesty application, almost seven years, considerably longer than any apartheid Minister.\n\tSecondly, since 1987 when I was convicted and sentenced to death for activities on behalf of the ANC, MK, these activities have been in the public realm and there has been no further legal action initiated against me all this time.  I come before this Commission in the spirit of reconciliation, I live reconciliation every day in my life and for me, it is not just a buzz word.  I also wish to clean the slate and put the conflicts of the past, behind me, hence I have included relatively minor incidents such as the burning of Fairvale High School.  I have also included activities for which I was acquitted at the time of the trial.  I place my trust in this Committee that it would treat my case fairly.  Other than reconciliation, I have nothing to gain from applying for amnesty.  For my activities to liberate myself and my fellow oppressed South Africans from apartheid, I have been scorned and insulted by a small minority of South Africans, as well as by that section of the media which is white owned and controlled.   This hearing will also give them an opportunity, the last one, to learn the facts about me and my opposition to apartheid.  I now turn to my formal statement.\n\"I was born on the 6th of July 1963 as a second class South African citizen, an oppressed person.  I was born in a ghetto, a product of apartheid.  I received inferior education.  My rights as a citizen were denied to me for the benefit of a small minority.  I have experienced since childhood every possible form of racial insult.  The State classified me as coloured, a term I have always detested as it infers being lessened by my black South African blood.  As a result of this, I have developed political consciousness during my early years and I was involved in various non-violent activities directed against apartheid until 1984.  In 1984 I assisted a number of ANC members in the distribution of pamphlets and ANC literature.\n\tHowever, I soon realised that the South African government and its surrogates, would not be persuaded to end racism through moral persuasion.   I accepted at this stage that violence was necessary.  The evidence for me of the correctness of this part was that before I was born ...\"",

        [
            "ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE",
            "That is correct sir.\n\"... The ANC initiated a limited armed struggle hoping to persuade the racist government to change.  They did not change and throughout that period, continued to oppress black people.  This oppression increasingly included mass murder and cross-border massacres.  The government did this with ever increasing ...(indistinct) support from the white community.   My sense of anger, frustration and helplessness in the face of this injustice, came to an end when I was formally recruited to MK Special Ops.  For the first time in my life I was able to do something against the system.  For the first time in my life, I was regarded as a South African, full status, without racial categorisation.   This elevation in my status was for me the most empowering moment of my life.\n\tFor this I thank the ANC and all those in the movement, that I have had the honour to work with.  For this I will always remain loyal to the ANC.   When I joined Special Ops, I decided to give myself completely to the ANC.  I broke off my relationship with a woman I was in love with and with whom I was discussing marriage.  I also decided not to complete my final year of my Higher Diploma in Education for the sake of pursuing the struggle on a full-time 24-hour basis.  \n\tI joined MK Special Ops in 1985.  I was recruited by Gordon Webster.   On recruitment I was told that I would be part of Special Ops.  It was emphasised that Special Ops was separate from the provincial machinery.  Our Overall Commander was Aboobaker Ismail or Rashid as we knew him, who reported directly to the NEC and in particular to the then President, Oliver Tambo.   \n\tOn recruitment I was also told I would not be given medals or money for my work, and that in all likelihood I would be killed in action.   I would also participate in actions where people would be killed.  I was given two weeks in which to think about this and after two weeks, I accepted and became a full member of Special Operations.  I was 22 years old at this stage.   I was told that I must be true to the Organisation and its leadership and also told never to volunteer information to the enemy.   \n\tThis in short was the understanding under which I formally joined the armed struggle against apartheid.  At the time I joined MK Special Ops, the ANC had more diplomatic missions abroad then the then South African government and was recognised as the most effective liberation movements against the apartheid regime.  The ANC was part of an internationally recognised and legitimate liberation movement.  I carried out all my operations under the auspices of the ANC and at all times, under the instructions of the ANC.  I did this to the best of my ability and with great risk to myself and my family.  \n\tI have served almost seven years as I have said earlier, in prison for my activities on behalf of MK Special Ops and the ANC and four of these were on death row.  I was released as a political prisoner in September 1992 as a consequence of negotiations between the ANC and the National Party.  I have had no gain whatsoever in material terms form my contribution to the struggle to rid South Africa of racism.  On the contrary, I and my family lost everything that we have built up over many years of hard work.  For this I have no regrets, South Africa is free.  I am no longer a second class citizen and my children will never be classified in this way.  We now have one of the best constitutions and Bills of Rights in the world.  However, I am truly sorry that in my quest for this freedom, I have caused the deaths of other South Africans.   Of this I am not proud.   This is the tragedy of the civil war that South Africa experienced as a result of apartheid.  \n\tI also cannot isolate the sadness I feel at those deaths, from the sadness I feel about the countless number of South Africans who died because the apartheid regime wanted to perpetuate itself.  \n\tAt this stage I want to turn to another matter.  I would like this Committee to help ascertain a list of precisely who Mr Richard represents as this was repeatedly requested of Mr Richard by your Committee and in as much as Mr Richard says he has the list, he has not yet produced it.  This list will assist me for purposes of reconciliation, to amongst other things, understand precisely who opposes my amnesty application and in regard to which count this relates.  \n\tMore importantly I would like to know before I begin to traverse the details of my application, as to whether the victims Mr Richard represents, still persist in the denial of all matters relative to my application for amnesty as Mr Richard indicated, or do they now, having had the benefit of Mr Ismail's testimony, admit any aspect.  This enquiry is important as I and my legal representative can then know precisely what I am not required to prove or not.  Thank you.\"",

What is required here is for us to receive your evidence, and then to determine in terms of the criteria contained in the Act, whether what you have told us, suffices to make a decision on your applications in so far as the incidents in which you, for which you apply for amnesty.  The main criteria, and there are various other criteria which Mr Dehal knows is that whether your actions at all times in respect of each of the incidents, were performed in furtherance of a political objective, committed during the conflict of the past and secondly whether there has been a full disclosure in our view as to what role you played in respect of each of the incidents.   Whether a victim, any victim in any amnesty application is opposing or not opposing, does not really have a major impact in regard to the satisfaction by the applicant of those criteria contained in the Act.",

As will appear from the record, since last week I have repeatedly been requesting access to the transcript of the trial record of the prosecution against Mr McBride.   While true it has been brought to this hearing, it is important to put on record that to date I have not been given those volumes which contain the indictments and the ancillary supporting documents, the admissions or the evidence of Mr McBride.  I still, when I received documents over the weekend, those volumes were missing.  I raised this point and it was not corrected.  It must be seen against the context that the strenuous opposition to Volume C, Exhibit C was a topic of argument yesterday.\n\tDuring that argument mention was made of other documents referred to in Exhibit C, it seems as if there is only one consistent inference to be drawn from this refusal or failure to get the documents into my possession.  We know and I think it is now important to put it on record, that there are various contradictory and conflicting versions of various incidents contained in all three documents and I think that there is a constructive effort underway to prevent access to the contradicting documents so as to prevent cross-examination on them, but I will leave the point till later, I have put it on record, and I will deal with it in cross-examination.",

Strenuous efforts were made around the country to obtain such a record, even the appeal record was not, had been unbundled and - we then made enquiries from Mr Dehal at a very early stage and he indicated that he did have an archive of documents at the trial, but that he would also require, because they weren't specifically at his office, he had to also make time to go through them and satisfy which was reasonable in the circumstances, given the extent of time that had elapsed.  We did indicate in writing that any documentation to be used, we would welcome at an early stage, and I understand when we got into Durban, enquiries were made for access to the record.  I understood that Mr Richard and Mr Dehal were in contact with each other as was the case with other legal representatives, and because we did not have a pre-hearing, it was agreed that the legal representatives would be able to communicate formally with each other and obtain whatever documents, and I think at the beginning of the hearing it was also raised, and there was an indication from Mr Dehal as I recall, that he would make the relevant documentation available to Mr Richard, that we could at least, from the victims' side at least, that he could prepare himself on that evidence.

I want to begin at this level - I take ...(indistinct) negative aspersions on my professional calibre, attitude, etc.  I do not like it.  I think it must be addressed correctly, he started this - forgive me - irresponsible attitude and accusations towards me some time ago, and I think it must stop right here and now, I am fed up of it.  I must place on record quite correctly that I am the only person who would appear to have a record.  I told Mr Prior on the telephone when first I spoke to him and he enquired about the trial record, that I thought and I still know that copies of all the bundles are available at what is commonly termed death row, that is Maximum Security Prison.  I know that they are still there, he is the Evidence Leader.  I have a copy.  I managed to extract it from the archives late on Thursday, Friday was a holiday.\n\tMr Richard has said I have failed, I have refused, he has constantly asked, he has not had it, this is a lie.  He has had it.  I have given the document to Mr Paddy Prior, he was the custodian at the time.  A weekend passed, that was Friday last week or Thursday last week and then Mr Richard had it with him.  The following Monday he mentioned to me and I say this in his favour, that he had not had the time to read them all and I accept that.  There is no difficulty about that, but against the background of him having had all those two Volumes of photographs and all the Volumes in the transcript, he cannot now say he has never had it.  This weekend he has called me personally to deliver these documents to him.  That means the trial transcript.  I went out of my way as to drive from a place outside Verulam, some 42 kilometres away and deliver it to him at the place he is presently resident.  I agree I did not give him all the Volumes, but that is principally because I am leading Mr McBride, I had to prepare.  Now I have been disadvantaged by giving him my Volumes, he is not the person who has to have all the Volumes all the time, I am also a legal representative in this matter and I have a duty to Mr McBride and I am endeavouring as best I can, to deliver that duty.  I am being prejudiced, Mr McBride is being prejudiced by me delivering those to him.  \n\tYesterday he phones me just as I begin my consultation to say now these are the Volumes I have and these are the Volumes I don't have, when are you delivering them to me and I was equally fed up with that, and I told him that I am being prejudiced by not having some Volumes, I need what you had and seriously you need what I have.  Can we not approach Mr Prior and make some copies of these and let's put to rest this whole issue about whether I ought to deliver them to you or not.

I understood the ANC as having then issued instructions to all people who regarded themselves as patriots.  Such instructions were amongst others to carry out acts of political or revolutionary violence.  In consequence various persons, including myself in Wentworth, formed our own combat unit.   \n\tThe first operation (and I should add in here the last one, there wasn't any other that I was involved in according to my recollection) was the arson attack on the Fairvale School.  I say this because shortly thereafter I was recruited by Gordon Webster.  By coincidence within the matter of a week or so, after then.   The object was in the main to highlight the inferior and dilapidated condition of the school, a complaint that we had tirelessly taken up till then.  We hoped that this long standing issue would now be addressed.  \n\tMy own activity in the operation was that I poured petrol into the school and threw a match in which caused the petrol to ignite and thus caused the arson.

I, myself, escaped from detention when I was in detention as my first sign of resistance to my capture.  I was shot and then recaptured.  Secondly, if one of your comrades are captured as a soldier, it is your duty to help them escape.   Any soldier does that anywhere in the world.   On these grounds alone, I initially decided that a rescue operation should be mounted.\"\n\tI just want to add if there is ever the contention that I did it because Gordon Webster was my friend and close associate, yes, he was my friend and close associate, but that was not the reason why I decided on the operation.   \n\"Gordon was really my senior although now in a different command.  The moment he was captured, I assumed command of both units.   I then assembled both units and put a plan into place to attempt a rescue.

The reason was that it would have been easier to effect the operation with the least number of people around.   \n\tThe initial plan of the operation was that a hole would be cut out in the fence at the back of the hospital so as not to attract attention.  The getaway car would be parked next to the fence with its hazard lights on and its bonnet up to indicate that it might be broken down.   We would enter from the back, go the second floor where Gordon was being kept, hold up the police, subdue them and lock them in the laundry room around the corner.  The information we received from contacts in the hospital was that Gordon was able to walk.  This information was later proved not to be true, he was unable to walk.   \n\tHaving subdued the two policemen, we would have taken Gordon out, loaded him into the van which was the getaway vehicle, dress him up and take him, exchange cars (I think there might be a grammatical error there) and he would be in a car with Greta Apelgren, a different car who would then drive him back to a designated spot.  The weapons that were used in the operation, would be handed over to Themba Khumalo  who would have already dug a hole in preparation for putting the weapons in there and covering them up.  His job also included as part of the operation, detonating two handgrenades in the vicinity of a police station in the opposite direction to which we were travelling, so as to draw the police to that area and to enable us to effect a getaway.

This was defused by the police, there was no detonator placed in this explosive device, on purpose.   \n\tDuring May 1986, the Eminent Persons Group of the Commonwealth visited South Africa in the hope of brokering a negotiations deal between the liberation movement and the South African government, then headed by P.W. Botha.  If my memory serves me correct, the Head of the delegation was the present President of Nigeria, Mr ...(indistinct).   In an attempt to scupper the possibility of a deal, P.W. Botha sent South African Security Forces to attack a number of targets in the neighbouring States simultaneously.  P.W. Botha did this, it was widely believed at the time, to set about a negotiations process which excluded the ANC.  This I understand was the message he had given to the Eminent Persons Group.  \t\n\tAt this stage I decided as Commander of my unit, that it was important that the ANC's presence be felt at that specific time so that the ANC can be regarded as an integral part of any lasting solution to the then conflict.   A device was then put together, consisting of explosive charges which on their own are inert, for example it can be thrown from a building or it can be put in a fire, but will remain harmless.  These devices were camouflaged with paper, electric wire, aerosol spray to make them appear to be more sinister than they actually were.  \n\tTogether with Jeanette Apelgren, who was subsequently a State witness against me in the trial, who is the sister of Greta, I proceeded to the Pine Parkade as a central location in Durban and placed the \"bomb\" under (it should be under, not on), under one of the cars.  This was intentionally done at the Pine Parkade, as this was known as one of the most secure parking garages in the city at the time and in full knowledge that the parcel would be found very quickly.  The parcel was found and the police attempted to \"disarm\" or \"defuse\" the \"bomb\".  The remainder of the so-called bomb which was thought to contain a detonator, was taken away in a bomb disposal vehicle and by ten o'clock the following morning, had not exploded clearly indicating that there was no detonator in there.\"   \n\tI must just mention here that the Security Police at the time went together with the media, went on a long song and dance about how terrible the ANC is, placing such a device there, and neglected to mention that the device did not explode and would not have exploded. \n\"For this incident I was convicted of the lesser offence of causing a public disturbance under Section 52 of the Terrorism Act.  I was sentenced to, if my memory serves me correct, to two years.  The police themselves added additional explosives to what was left of the parcel after it had been dismantled and detonated themselves.  That was after more than 12 hours.\"",

We looked at alternatives of the type of attack that can be used, we then came to the conclusion that a car bomb would not be appropriate for the Military base, mainly because of the openness of the area and secondly because no private cars were allowed to park close to the premises of Natal Command.

Mr Davidson was asked by my lawyer whether to his knowledge his place was frequented by Security Force personnel from C.R. Swart and from the military, what I can recall from the conversation was that he confirmed this, he mentioned C.R. Swart, he also mentioned something like Dunnitor Boys Army Pilot, he also indicated that at some stage he was accused of some crime, I think it was selling drugs and the same police who frequented the place, assisted him in getting rid of the charge.  He also added that at one stage one of the police who frequented the place, he met whilst in uniform   at a race course and this guy even gave him a tip to place a bet on something, which won, I think he said Jamaican Music.  In short, the conversation I heard from the manager of the Parade Hotel confirms that indeed the place was frequented by a large amount of Security Force personnel.\n\"Several discussions were held during political education with amongst others Lester Dumakude, Lekote Pule, Johannes Mnisi on the possibility of attacking such places frequented by Security Force personnel.  During these discussions it was indicated to us that this would be in line with ANC policy and ANC guidelines on the attacks of Security Force personnel.  That we had reconnoitred such a place, a bar, was conveyed to the Sub-Command.\n\tMyself and Gordon were instructed by Rashid at that stage then to separate into two different units.  My understanding then was that if the car bomb was to take place, Gordon's unit would carry it out at that stage.  Unfortunately within the next month or so, Gordon Webster was injured and captured and a member of his unit killed, and he was later rescued by us and taken out of the country.  I immediately assumed command of his unit at this stage.

After the place closest to the Why Not was secured, I then walked back to where Matthew was and came with the blue Ford Cortina, which had the explosive device in the car.   I indicated to Greta to move out and then parked the blue Ford Cortina in the designated place.  I then activated the explosive and left the scene.  I then got into Greta's car and we proceeded.   \n\tAs I had not filled up petrol in the getaway car, I then decided to do this.  This was normal procedure for Special Ops to fill petrol before any operation and I had neglected to do this.   The reason I was taught this for was that at some previous stage comrades had effected an attack, retreated and ran out of petrol during the retreat and were later killed.   We took it as an axiom,  always fill up the car with petrol.  On this occasion I forgot to do it.  I think we did fill petrol in Petrus Street or close to that area.  Immediately after filling up petrol, I realised that the bomb must have already exploded, because I set it only for 15 minutes.  \n\tI then proceeded to the Durban Flying Squad area on Ridge Road, where I expected to hear police sirens as this would have indicated to me whether the bomb had already gone off and whether a Security cordon had already been thrown around the city.    I was concerned that we might have trapped ourselves in the cordon by setting the time too short.  After sitting on the Ridge Road for approximately five minutes, we then left the area and drove home.  I dropped off Greta and Matthew.\"",

For these acts I was convicted and sentenced for all three of them.  These were done on the same day, although some exploded before the others, they were actually - charges were laid sometimes last, because the first ones in some cases, had the longer timing devices.  Matthew Lecordier, myself and Antonio du Preez carried out these operations.  Antonio drove.  He dropped us off as if we were fishing or we were going to go fishing.  This oil pipe is the same oil pipe that goes out to the Reunion terminal for tankers, that comrade Rashid referred to earlier, that another unit was tasked to sabotage this terminal.  We had found the pipe that leads to the terminal, to the oil refinery.  It is right next to the sea, hence we would not have been out of place if we pretended we were going fishing.

At trial I was charged and convicted of attempting to overthrow or endanger State authority in the Republic and to achieve, bring about or promote constitutional, political, industrial and or economic change in the Republic.  The Why Not car bomb operation was carried out on the 14th of June 1986, during a period of extreme political upheaval in South Africa, which had culminated in the declaration of a nation wide state of emergency on June the 12th.  Among other things, the declaration of the state of emergency was an acknowledgement by the then government of the extent of the turmoil in the country.   State of emergency granted unlimited powers to the Security Forces and indemnity from prosecution for acts carried out during this period.  The operation also took place within the context of the ANC's organised political uprising against the minority government of the day.  Within this, it is important to look at the following factors - one year previously to the day, the Security Forces had raided Gaberone in Botswana, killing 12 people, two Botswana citizens, one Somalian, one six year old child from Lesotho and eight South Africans.  Of the South Africans, eight were ANC members, none of them were MK combatants.  The addition of the Setchaba following this attack, the editorial stated the following - the struggle of the people of South Africa will be intensified at all costs.  The time has come when we should avenge our martyrs.  In addition the 1985 conference of the ANC held in Kabwe had decided that the distinction between soft and hard targets should disappear.  An article from Setchaba at the time, outlines some of the reasoning behind this.\"",

The attack on South African refugees in Botswana by the racist Forces, just before the conference, emphasised the need for our movement to bleed the enemy.  On the same theme, the then President of the ANC, Oliver Tambo stated the following in an interview - I will summarise the position taken by the conference in these terms - the struggle must be intensified at all costs.   \n\tOver the past nine to ten months at least, at the very least, there have been many soft targets hit by the enemy, nearly 500 people had died during that period.  That works out to about 50 per month, massacred, shot down, killed secretly.  All those were very, very soft targets.  They belong to the sphere of the intensification of the struggle.  The distinction between soft and hard targets is going to disappear in an intensified confrontation, in an escalating conflict.   \n\tThe detonation of a car bomb outside the Why Not bar took place within this context, both as a commemoration for a brutal attack on civilians in Gaberone one year previously and the commemoration of the 16th of June 1976 when hundreds of innocent school children were killed by the Security Forces.\"",

            "Yes.\n\t\"For all of the above operations, I accept political and general responsibility for them.   For people who acted under my command, whether they carried it out without my assistance or specific instructions.  They were people who were trained and educated in the policies of the ANC, by me, and hence I take responsibility for these actions and support their respective applications for amnesty on these operations.  On behalf of all those who acted under my command, and on behalf of the ANC, I wish to state on record that I truly regret the injury and death that I have caused during the pursuance of the armed struggle, whether directly or indirectly.   \n\tAn issue appeared to have arisen during the evidence given during this hearing, as to why two operations are placed in chapter 5 of the ANC submissions, namely the Klein incident and the Pine Parkade incident.  The explanation inter alia is that all the incidents for which I have been convicted, I had applied for amnesty for.  I did not state these specifically in my application form, but rather refer to my indictment.   Hence, during the compilation of the ANC submissions, the ANC was unable to ascribe responsibility mainly because they did not have my trial records, which included the indictment and wherein these cases were outlined.  Hence, as an administrative error, these were placed elsewhere.  \n\tIn any case, all these acts, including these two have been supported by my Commander, Aboobaker Ismail, comrade Rashid.  As will clearly be noted, the versions and attitude on all these operations in my trial evidence, differs from my present evidence.  One of the main reasons for these differences is that during the trial, I was really being tried for my life, and I was facing four charges of murder, five of attempted murder and various other serious charges.   \n\tMy being an ANC member would in itself have aggravated my position in the eyes of the Trial Bench.  If I had testified that I was instructed to carry out the Why Not operation, as now testified by my Commander, comrade Rashid, it is obvious that there would have been no extenuating circumstances found as premeditation would have been common cause, previous MK guerrillas who were tried for cases of murder in which it was established that instructions were given, were convicted and sentenced to death.  They usually were hanged.  In one such case, a person was sentenced to death for what is tantamount to Contempt of Court charge, he had not killed anybody and here I speak of James Maunge.  This was the atmosphere in the country at that time.  I also wanted to protect my organisation by not talking about them and their instructions to me.  Hence I did not refer to instructions during my trial with regard to this operation.  \n\tIn addition to this, I as an oppressed person did not feel that there is any moral imperative or onus on me to have to be truthful or honourable with the regime that oppresses me and uses its judiciary to perpetuate discrimination and oppression against me, with unjust laws and unjust people trying me.  The situation is different to the situation I now face in this hearing.  All these operations took place a long time ago.  My recollection therefore suffers as a result.  These operations were carried out under tense conditions and were akin to warlike operations.  For this reason as well, my exact recollection is not always precise.\"",
