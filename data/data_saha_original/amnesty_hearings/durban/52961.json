There are however certain witnesses that have been contacted either telephonically or via intermediaries.  Certain notes were made of those conversations.  I have not yet corroborated any of the information in those notes with witnesses who apparently are arriving during the course of today and insofar as that may constitute an investigation report, I'll make those available to all the parties with the provision, with the reservation that they are simply notes, they have not yet been substantiated and there's no indication at this stage whether any of those persons who will be present here today will be called.  Obviously that decision may change.  Photocopies are being prepared and I will distribute them to all the parties during the course of the morning.  Thank you Mr Chairman.",

The only point is simply this, that if witnesses are going to be called, we would hate to ask for the matter to stand down for us to prepare at that stage, we would like beforehand just to be prepared so that if a witness gives evidence, one can cross-examine him immediately, it's as simple as that.\n\tIf that is all Mr Chairman, may I then proceed?  First of all Mr Chairman, you will find before you two bundles, copies of Exhibit A, we gave you one yesterday which I would ask you just to uplift to add the two covering pages to it.  I'm not sure where it is floating around at the moment but I recall that we handed you one copy without the covering pages yesterday.  If I could uplift that for a moment, I could add the two covering pages for you and then you would each have a copy, Mr Chairman.  The problem which we have is that we don't seem to be able to have copies made with the facilities of the TRC here, but we have been able to recover some copies so that at least each of the Members of the Committee will have a copy.  We won't address that document now, Mr Chairman, we will do so when Mr Botha appears before you as a witness.\nIf I may then continue with Mr Wasserman, Mr Chairman?\n\tMr Wasserman, you are still bound by your oath which you took yesterday to speak the truth, do you understand that?",
