<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, is it Ms Loonat, are you representing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Nkwanyana and Mpilo Khuzwayo, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you ready to proceed?  Very well.  Yes Ma'am, I might as well make a note of your name as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MS JELAL:</span> Ms Jelal, I represent the families of the victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we'll do it formally in a minute.  We will now proceed to hear the amnesty application of Osmond Bekisisa Nkwanyana Amnesty Reference AM5214/97 and the application of Ketha Mpilo Khuzwayo Amnesty Reference AM6175/97.  The Panel is constituted as is apparent from the record.  I'm going to ask the legal representatives to put themselves formally on the record.  Ms Loonat, perhaps you should do that first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  I'm Zereena Loonat and I'm representing Mr Nkwanyana this morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Ms Loonat.  Ms Jelal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MS JELAL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson I represent the families of the victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Leader of Evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Zuko Mapoma, Leader of Evidence, as before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr Chairperson if I may just inquire, are you just representing Mr Nkwanyana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Both of them, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Ms Loonat, who's the first applicant that you are going to lead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Mr Chairperson, we'd like to lead Mr Nkwanyana first because his actually not applying for amnesty, he maintains that at the last session, he maintains that he wasn't even present at the scene of the crime, so he can't apply for amnesty.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, well let me just see.  We do have an application from him, so you'll lead him on that and we'll hear what his testimony is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Yes, certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Do you want me to administer the oath to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Yes, please, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I'll do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">OSMOND BEKISISA NKWANYANA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Ms Loonat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS LOONAT:</span> Mr Nkwanyana, do you belong...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry, Ms Loonat, just a minute.  I just want to clear up something with the Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Ms Loonat, I assume that you know we do have a formal amnesty application before us, I assume that the comment that you made earlier relates to the attitude of the applicant, as he's conveyed that to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Alright.  But I assume you're going to lead his evidence on this application and we'll hear what he says and then assess in the light of his evidence what his position really is.  So you'll let him tell the whole story to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Will do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes and we'll see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Mr Nkwanyana, do you belong to any political party?  Which one and for how long?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, I am a member of a political organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Please tell the Committee which party you belong to and for how long have you been a member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Have you been an active member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> No, I was just an ordinary member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the question was, since when was that, since when are you a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> From 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Ms Loonat.  Thank you.  Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Thank you.  Do you own a firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> No, I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Do you have any training in the use of firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Do you have proof that you're a member?  Are you a card-carrying member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, I had a membership card but it was burned down when my house was burned down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> In what circumstances was your house burned down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> It was burned late at night.  There were attackers, I think IFP supporters attacked, even though I do not have proof that it was IFP, but everyone knew that it was IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Did these attacks take place quite often or was that the only one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> It was frequent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> And were you told it was always IFP, or just random attacks by people you don't know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> We knew that it was IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In which area was all this happening, Mr Nkwanyana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> In Majane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, say again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Majane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At Majane.  Was there a situation of political conflict, political violence between IFP and ANC in this area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  Ms Loonat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Thank you.  What is the level of your education?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Standard 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Are you married?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> No, I'm not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Do you have any children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I heard that I do have a child, but I didn't see that child because the only time I learned about this is when I was in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> May I just clear up something Ms Loonat?  Mr Nkwanyana, you mention in your application form in paragraph 4 on page 4, if you could just have regard to that and indicate to me.  You mention that you learned that your daughter had been injured.  Is this the daughter that you are referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> It is not my daughter that I was referring to on my application, I was referring to my sister's daughter or my brother's daughter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you, you may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Mr Nkwanyana, please tell the Members of the Committee how you came to be involved in this alleged crime that you have been sentenced for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I had been in that area because I had run away from my home because people were attacking us in my home.  We received a letter in eZakeni and in that letter it was written that my home had been attacked and the house had been burned down and a kid had been injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> What did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> The following day I decided to go back home to look or to try and get how far the damage went.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> How long did you leave your area, to go to the area where you heard about this attack?  How long had you left your home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> When I left Majane it was in 1993, towards the end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> And you didn't return at all to your home, did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I would only go home to visit them during the day and then leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Why were you scared to go and visit people, your family that was still living there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Would you please repeat that question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> You say you went occasionally during the day to visit your family.  Why did you go occasionally to visit them, why didn't you move back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I was scared because attackers were attacking us during the night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Mr Nkwanyana, on the 3rd of May 1994 were you a part of the gang who attacked Mr Mthembu and Mr Sibiya?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> No, I wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Why is your name being mentioned then, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I would say it is because of what others had seen because I had just arrived in the area to look on the situation therefore I think if anyone from the IFP had seen me, they'd identified me as one of the people who attacked these two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> You say you arrived in the area to look at the situation.  What situation are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I wanted to look at the situation in my home because a kid had been injured, had been shot, therefore I went there to assist my family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> So in fact you're saying you were present in the area on the day of the attack, but did you have any idea that this attack was going to take place on this particular kraal that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> No, I didn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> What then were you doing there?  What happened at the time that you were there?  Did you hear any fighting, any gunshots?  What happened when you were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> From the house where I was, one cannot see what was going on in the house which was being attacked, but one could only hear.  I heard gunshots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In your application form on page 5 of the record, the bundle before us, you are saying that you had gone home and the people of your neighbourhood decided to attack your political opponents in order to take revenge over those people who were injured in the previous attack.  You say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>"That is when I committed the crime."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>Then on page 6 of the record, that's still part of your application form, it's paragraph 10 (b) you are saying that, the last three lines of that paragraph, you say:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>"We were also aware that we were attacking Inkatha Freedom Party settlement."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>Have you noticed that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is this your application form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  We're going to take the tea adjournment at this stage for 15 minutes.  I think your lawyer will explain what, how the process of this Committee works and I think your lawyer will explain to you under what circumstances it is possible to approach the Committee for amnesty, but we'll adjourn for tea for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">OSMOND BEKISISA NKWANYANA:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Loonat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Just to recap.  Mr Nkwanyana did say that he was on his way to visiting his sister and the child that was apparently in hospital.  I'll go on from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS LOONAT:</span> (cont.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>	Mr Nkwanyana you say that you heard gunshots.  Where were you at the time?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I was in a shebeen at Mrs Dlamini's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> You said you were going to the hospital.  What were you doing at the shebeen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> On my way home I met my mother and my mother told me that the child was in hospital in Ngwelezane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> So why didn't you go on to see her in the hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I wanted to have a look on the damage in my house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Go on.  What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> On my way home, my home is near a shop.  I saw Mr Ketha Khuzwayo and Lana, then I decided to go to the shop and I didn't see any other persons there, I only saw them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Could I just interrupt Mr Nkwanyana?  Please tell us first, when you were at the shebeen, what actually happened at the Shebeen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I bought two beers and I sat there and I drank.  There was another lady from Izobo, a family and Msonela Manyawo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> And what were you all doing together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> We were drinking, Msonela and myself.  As we were sitting there I heard gunshots.  First I heard gunshots, but the noise was not too loud and then later I heard another gunshot which was louder than the first one and then I left that place because I thought that something was not right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Did you have a firearm on you at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Did you all run away from the shebeen, is that what you're saying, when the gunshots were heard?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, we all ran away.  We were scattered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Where were you going from there?  What was your plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I decided to go back where I was coming from because I was scared if other people were to come they were maybe going to kill me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> May I just interpose?  You say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>"We all ran away."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>Who are the all that ran away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> There were people in that shebeen people who were working from a sugar cane field and they were there in that shebeen.  They all ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> You were saying something about going to a shop on your way back home.  Please carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> When I arrived at the shop, I found Ketha and Prescott Langa and Simunye Mthembu.  Next to that shop there is a house that belonged to Mthembu family.  I took one guy from Mthembu's family because they were also attacked, or his family had been attacked and I told him to accompany me.  We went to another house and we found my sister and the daughter-in-law of the Mthembu family.  I greeted them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> And what was your sister's name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Olive Nkwanyana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> What was your discussion with her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I greeted her and I asked her if my brother-in-law was present and also asked him if he was well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Who is your brother-in-law?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Armand Sibiya.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> That's the deceased, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Oh, I beg your pardon.  Who is Armand Sibiya, he's Olive's husband, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> And what do you know about Sibiya's political activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> He was once a councillor in the area after the one who was elected as a councillor had left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Which party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> What was your relationship with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> We had a good relationship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> In spite of the fact that you belonged to the ANC and he belongs to the IFP, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Was he an active member of the IFP, would you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> So you maintained a relationship with him because of your sister being his fiance, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Please go on from there.  What did you do thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Even though I do not remember quite well but Olive and myself, we talked and also the other lady who was with her, we talked with her and she was asking us about the situation in the area where we were staying.  Then we left the place.   Just before we arrived in the shop I decided not to go inside the shop because I realised that I didn't have enough money and then I told the guy I was with that he will tell them that I went to Ma Dlamini's house, or Mrs Dlamini's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Tell who?  You said tell them, who's them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Ketha, Prescott and Themba Nkosi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Did you know what Ketha and Prescott were doing that day in the shop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> They were drinking cooldrink.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Were you aware that they were going to attack Mr Sibiya on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I would like to put it this way, that usually in meetings, their names will come out as people who were harassing the community, or people whom the community didn't like but on that specific day I didn't know that they were going to attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Mr Nkwanyana, have you taken part in any actual faction fighting between the IFP/ANC parties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> How many roughly?  A few, a lot, can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I would say twice, but in both occasions whenever we had planned to launch an attack, we will arrive there after the people have been told by other people that we were coming to attack them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> So what you're saying is that in fact you did take part in these attacks but you were not successful because the people were pre-warned, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> So if you were given instructions to take part, you would have taken part in any faction fighting, is that correct, between IFP and ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Do you have any previous convictions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How's that going to help us, Ms Loonat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> I'll withdraw that Mr Chairperson, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>You did say that you had no training in firearms, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> So what was your role when you were instructed to take part in any of the attacks on IFP areas?  What was your role?  What were your instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> When people are attacking, they are not using firearms only.  I will use anything, a spear or a knife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> To do what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> To attack and kill whoever will come my way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Where is this question taking us Ms Loonat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> It's just to establish that he is an active member of a political party.  He does take part, when he was instructed to, but on this particular occasion he was not a party to it, which is why he's applying for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Okay, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> Is there anything else you would like to add, Mr Nkwanyana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> No, I don't have anything to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOONAT:</span> I have no further question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS LOONAT</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Ms Loonat.  Mr Nkwanyana, just look at page 5 of the record, paragraph 9 (c) (i).  Who is Iliakem Nkosi Mthembu, who is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I think it's the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You think he's deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now under what circumstances did he die?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> He was attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To what political party did he belong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Did you know him personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, I knew him because sometimes I'll meet him at my brother-in-law's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now who attacked him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I was told that he was attacked by Ketha Khuzwayo, Themba Nkosi Mthembu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So have you not witnessed this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you just hear about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you put his name in this form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> It is because he's the one who died when this attack was launched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but what has it got to do with you?  Why do you put his name in your application form for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> This was done by people whom I knew very well and we came together, but on this specific day when they did this, I wasn't with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, no, that is what you say.  I hear what you say about that but now why's his name in here?  What has he got to do with your amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Because I was sentenced and convicted because of his death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So at the court that convicted and sentenced you, did the witness come there to say that you participated in this attack on this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what is your response to that allegation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I would like you to repeat the question for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The witnesses at your trial, you say that those witnesses came to the court and they told the court that you took part in this, you participated in this attack on the deceased, Mr Mthembu, that's what you told us now.  I'm asking you, what is your response to that allegation against you?  They say that you participated in this attack, so what do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> What I can say is that the people who attacked and killed him, were the people who were usually with me and these people, the witnesses, they've seen me with these people, I think that's why they witnessed that I was one of the people who attacked the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And are you saying that they're wrong if they say that you attacked the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And this other name, underneath that one, in that same place on that form, Herman Sibiya and there's written in brackets (injured).  Now who's that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> My brother-in-law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that your sister's husband, or boy friend, or whatever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, my sister's husband.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And why is his name here in your form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Same reason that I've already mentioned that the witnesses mentioned my name that I was together with my friends when they launched the attack because this was same case, it happened in one day, same time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So Mthembu and Sibiya were attacked at the same time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you were also not part of that attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And those witnesses are wrong again, that came to the court to say that you were in fact part of that attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Ms Jelal, have you got any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MS JELAL:</span> Just one, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS JELAL:</span> Sir, is it correct that your submissions to this Committee is that you knew nothing of the planned attack against Sibiya and Mthembu and that you had nothing to do with the occurrences of that day being the 3rd of May 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, but what I can say is that usually I would attend meetings, then I will hear about their names coming up as names of the people who were their targets or people whom they wanted attack them, but when I arrived there on that day, I didn't know that they were going to attack them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MS JELAL:</span> So did you join the party who you believe did attack Sibiya and Mthembu and did you participate in this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Would you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MS JELAL:</span> Yes.  Did you know of the attack?  Did you participate in the attack?  Did you join the group of people whom you believe did attack Sibiya and Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> If I were instructed to do so, I would have, but I wasn't and there I didn't know anything about it, therefore I didn't join them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MS JELAL:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS JELAL</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry, can you just explain something here, Mr Nkwanyana.  When you heard that the deceased and Mr Sibiya had been attacked, did you agree with that?  Did you feel that your comrades had done the correct thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you complete this form yourself, the application form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I didn't myself, but I was telling someone who was helping me, he was the one who was writing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Why did you ask someone to complete this form in your name and for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> When I arrived in Westville Prison, I found the amnesty application forms and they were written in English.  There were no Zulu application forms at the time, therefore since I had an English application, I had to ask someone to assist me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is that to say that you were applying for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Just try and give me a picture in mind of this area where this attack took place.  You say you were at the shebeen when you heard two shots, how far was the shebeen from the place where the attack had taken place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> I wouldn't be able to assist you with that but it is not that far.  It can be a kilometre or more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Would you say it is the same street or an adjacent street, parallel street?  Is it more or less the same area, same location?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> It is the same area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nkwanyana, just look again at that page 5 of this bundle.  I referred you to that earlier but I haven't asked you to explain it yet.  That on top of page 5 of the record, the bundle, that last sentence there, or that last phrase,:  "That is when I committed crime".  What crime are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Maybe it's the person who was assisting me who didn't put correct words.  What I was trying to say is that that's where the crime was committed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> By others and not by yourself, is that what you explained to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Mr Mapoma, questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Mr Nkwanyana, you said that in meetings the names of Mr Sibiya and Mr Mthembu used to feature.  What were those meetings all about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> ANC meetings which we used to hold over the weekends and sometimes on Saturdays and sometimes on Wednesdays.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> You have said that there was conflict between the ANC and IFP, was this conflict discussed in those meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And in those meetings were there some attacks that had to be launched by the ANC, discussed in some of those meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, sometimes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now you have said that on some occasions you yourself used to participate in attacking the IFP, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And those attacks that you yourself used to participate in, were there some of those attacks discussed in the ANC meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, sometimes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So on this day when Sibiya and Mthembu attacked, you say you were not party to those who attacked there?  You were not involved physically, do I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> When the discussions were entered into in the meeting and when their names featured in those discussions before the attack, was there some resolution that they have to be attacked at some point or another in your presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, I heard about this once because these were the people whom we all knew that they were a problem to us but as to when they were going to be attacked and how they were going to be attacked, I was never told and I was never in such a meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, those who attacked there, did you regard them as having carried the resolutions of the ANC by attacking Sibiya and Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, do you regard yourself as having anything to blame yourself about, or on the death of Sibiya and Mthembu?  Is there something that you yourself find yourself guilty of regarding the death of those two gentlemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes and also because that I was sentenced because of this crime and it was partly because I knew all along that there was a possibility that they were going to be attacked, even though I didn't know exactly when.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now had you known that they were going to be attacked, were you going to be participating in that attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKWANYANA:</span> Yes, I was going to participate in that attack but there was a problem, because my comrades didn't trust me very well when it comes to Sibiya's issues, because sometimes I would go to Sibiya's house and this was sort of betraying their trust.  I think the reason they didn't reveal this to me, or they didn't tell me of this planned attack, it was because they were scared that I may betray them.
