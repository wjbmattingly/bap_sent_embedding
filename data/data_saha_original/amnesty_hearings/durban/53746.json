            "Okay.\n\"There came a time when we were all concerned about the inequalities in the country and the impoverished state that we lived in, in Wentworth.  The poor education and the tyranny at the hands of the legal gangsters, the police and Labour Party members, in whom the people had no faith.\n\t\tDuring or about 1985, I was employed with a place of safety in Wentworth, as a child care officer.  Here I dealt with orphans, children with conditions of severe neglect and abandoned children.  I also had the sad experience of observing the abuse of children by the staff members, that is other child care officers.\n\t\tWhen I raised this issue at staff meetings, I was told to simply follow orders and to listen and obey the authorities and not raise such issues.  When this continued I refused to accept it and I was told that since I refused I could leave this, and this I did.  This created feelings of awareness and sensitivity in me towards the suffering of children in Wentworth and the abuse of authority.\n\t\tI was not recruited at the time into MK, or into the Wentworth Unit.  I used to often visit the Allan Taylor residence, listen to Radio Freedom and read the voice of the ANC in exile, Setchaba.  I listened to discussions, particularly at the Allan Taylor residence by the students, all of which were in the main political discussions.\n\t\tDuring 1984 and 1985, I was also part of a group which included comrade Robert McBride and Marson Sharpley and others as well.  We would together hold regular political meetings at Allan Pearce's home.  This group later developed into what became known as the Fairvale Unit.  These developments took place as a result of our continued political education, aided by our listening to Radio Freedom, reading the Setchabas and attending meetings at the Allan Taylor residence.\n\t\tThe ANC literature, amongst other things, called on the patriots of the country to form units and attack targets, in particular government buildings, policemen and informers and other collaborators.  We formed this unit and it is this unit that carried out the Fairvale Secondary School arson attack.\n\t\tDuring this period also, one of the members of the group, Marson Sharpley, who was known to favour non-violence, at that stage was arrested by the Security Police and beaten up severely and held in detention without trial for several weeks.\n\t\tAfter his release we visited him at his home and there observed that he was so badly beaten up that his body which was light-skinned, was of a different colour as a result of the beatings on his person.  We also noticed that Marcel's personality had markedly changed, in that he was now in favour of violence and behaved in a paranoid manner when he observed a police vehicle or one that resembled it.\n\t\tIf he saw such a vehicle, and even if we were then in a middle of a discussion, he would immediately leave the discussion without notice to us and run for his life as though mad and fearful of this vehicle.\n\t\tThese impressions formed a distinct impression on me and encouraged me in the belief that a peaceful resolution for the change in this country was not possible.\n\t\tOn a wall in Antonio de Preez's home was a picture taken off from the newspapers, of an unknown black man being assaulted by an armed policeman.  It was a big picture, which had a great effect on my mind.\"",

The persons involved in this operation, within the unit, loosely set up Wentworth at time were Naziem Kassiem, Allan Pearce, Robert McBride and Marson Sharpley.\n\t\tAt the time of this operation we were not formally recruited into the ANC/MK unit, but we understood the policy and the guidelines of the ANC, had been listening to Radio Freedom, reading Setchaba, the voice of the ANC, and actively engaged ourselves in repeated daily discussions about the need to change the situation.  We understood that this could not be achieved by peaceful means.  \n\t\tThis was the first operation that I was involved in, and indeed the first that this combat unit carried out.  The object of this operation was to highlight the inferior and dilapidated condition of the school.  A complaint that had been tirelessly take up till then.

I knew that Klein was a police reservist and closely associated with the Labour Party.

Additionally I was aware of the room in the Klein's house, which was his bedroom.\n\t\tI went to the house with Antonio du Preez, in the early hours of the morning.  As instructed by comrade McBride, I threw the handgrenade through the window.  I had one handgrenade and Antonio du Preez had another.  Mr du Preez' handgrenade did not enter the house.  The handgrenade that I threw exploded within the house and that which Antonio du Preez threw, exploded on the outside of the house. I accept that there was injury to both Mr and Mrs Klein.  Mr McBride had not participated in this operation.  \n\t\tI am also aware that Mrs Klein featured prominently within Labour circles, in support of her husband who was a Labour Party member.  Even if Mrs Klein was not closely and actively involved in the Labour Party, I would still have gone on with this operation, in view of Mr Klein as a legitimate target.

Comrade McBride had so trained us.  He advised us that we will shortly be embarking on an operation in which we may be asked to use these weapons.\n\t\tShortly before the 4th of May, on a date I'm not too sure of, comrade Robert informed me he would shortly be calling upon me to make myself available for an operation.  \n\t\tAs mentioned, we operated strictly on the need-to-know discipline and all I advised him of was that I would be available within the next few days and did not ask any questions about the operation.\n\t\tIf I recall correctly, at about 4.30pm on the 4th of May 1986, comrade McBride called me to his father's workshop, where other comrades were present and we received a briefing on the Edendale operation. A map was used to advise us each of our respective task, duties, in this operation.\n\t\tWe then left in two separate vehicles to the Edendale Hospital.  I travelled with comrade McBride and others.  We travelled in a blue van. \n\t\tWhen we got to Pietermaritzburg we had to wait until visiting hours were over.  And since we had enough time a reconnaissance was carried out on this operation.  \n\t\tComrade Robert drove onto a dirt road to a fence outside the hospital and again explained to me my role.  We also went to a takeaway where we had coffee and tea.\n\t\tWhen we later got to Edendale Hospital to carry out the operation, my task was to cut a hole in the fence and to remain at the vehicle with the bonnet open, to create the impression that it was broken down.  So as not to draw any undue suspicion to it.\n\t\tComrade Robert McBride and Derek McBride had entered the hospital premises and after a short while I heard gunshots.  Shortly thereafter a person was brought, wheeled on a stretcher to the vehicle I was at.  I later learnt that this person is Gordon Webster.  He was introduced to me shortly after the operation as Steven Mkhize.\n\t\tComrade Webster was then placed into the vehicle and we drove to meet Greta Apelgren.  We did not meet her.  I was to have handed over the firearms to a Welile Khumalo, alias Themba, for him to safely bury them.\n\t\tComrade McBride then decided to drive to Wentworth, which we did.  At Wentworth, comrade Webster was placed into the Factorama(?) premises.  I assisted in looking after the ailing Webster.  I removed my socks and placed it on Webster's legs, massaged his feet and generally kept him comfortable.  Later comrade Robert took me to my home by car.\"",

He instructed me that if any person were to come to this vehicle to search the vehicle, I am to shoot them.  He also told me that I am to wait there and he would return within a short while to meet me.\n\t\tComrade Robert then got into the vehicle with Greta Apelgren and they drove off.  After a short while comrade Robert returned on foot to my vehicle, got into the vehicle and drove to the Marine Parade.\n\t\tWe then drove to the Marine Parade where Greta Apelgren was parked in a space which was not a parking bay, closest to the Why Not bar.  Details that I subsequently acquainted myself on.  Comrade Robert signalled to Greta to come out of the space and as she did that, Robert parked the blue Ford Cortina in that space.\n\t\tThis was the spot nearest to the Why Not bar.

The Marine Parade was not too busy at the time, as it was drizzling and getting late in the evening.\n\t\tComrade Robert asked me to get the numberplate of the vehicle from the front and hand it to him, which I did.  Robert instructed me to be vigilant and to watch around to see if we were being watched.  He also instructed me to keep the firearm in readiness.  Comrade Robert then showed me a pin.  \tI may at this stage indicate that comrade Robert had trained us that whenever an explosive device is detonated, the pin removed is to be shown to the Commander before it is disposed of where convenient.

            "EXAMINATION BY MR DEHAL",
            "(cont)\n\tMr Lecordier, you were busy with the background and your involvement as a State witness in those trials, earlier trials.  Do you mind looking at the top of page 11 and beginning at (ix).  \"In the result ...\"\nMR LECORDIER\n\"In the result, the judge found that I was not a satisfactory State witness, having not made full and open disclosure and did not indemnify me.\n\t\tMy version as a Security Police witness, as a State witness in the trial was largely incorrect, being a version that the police suggested to me.  In particular, the version relating to my intention at some stage to carry out an armed robbery, was one that the Security Police made up and insisted I add, so as to criminalise this whole political event.  On occasions I attempted to argue this against them, but they beat me up and repeated their threats.  I had to say this in Court.  \n\t\tI have since the trial was over, apologised to McBride and we have reconciled and he has understood that I was a victim of circumstances, a victim of the brutal Security Police.\n\t\tAt some stage after the trial, the Security Police congratulated me on the assistance I gave to them.  They paid me an amount of money, although I do not recall the precise sum.   I think it was either R2 000 or R2 500.  They arranged an employment for me in Cape Town.  However, they wanted me to be a spy for them.  When I refused to continue to participate with them, I was forced out of this employment.  This happened as a result of a fight I was engaged in with one of the co-employees.  On reflection, it appears clear to me that this was set up to force me out of my employment.\n\t\tIn Cape Town there was a Security Policeman who was in charge of me and whom I remember as Kannemeyer, a Coloured man from Mitchell's Plain.  Shortly I left the above employ, the Security Police again approached me and requested that I infiltrate some of the unions and give information on them.   As I was under pressure from them, I decided that the best thing for me to do was to simply escape, so that they could not trace me.\n\t\tThe fear I had was, I could not return to Wentworth, my home town, as the people regarded me as a sell-out in view of my having assisted the Security Police in being a State witness against comrade McBride and the other comrades.\n\t\tI was at a loss to understand where to go and in the result felt hopeless and lost.  I had no-one to turn to.  The Security Police had made a misery of my life.  They had caused me to be an outcast by my own people and indeed caused me, forcibly, to turn against my very own comrades.  They were not concerned about this position they placed me in, but were selfish in their desires, continuing in their instance that I infiltrate organisations to help them.  In the result I was left alone without friends and family, without a job, utterly frustrated, deeply distressed and not knowing which way to turn.\n\t\tAs earlier indicated, I was neither indemnified in the earlier trail, nor charged with the acts for which I seek amnesty.  I seek amnesty for all these counts and apologise to any persons that may have been injured or killed, directly or indirectly as a result of my participation in any of the aforesaid operations.\n\t\tI have no hesitation in engaging in reconciliation with any of the victims of the family members of the deceased.  I am sorry for this.  It was understood by us that the Security Police were keenly desirous to destroy us after they used us as State witnesses and threw us back into society.  The society kills us for being State witnesses.  The Security Police knew this and wished it upon us.\n\t\tWhen I was in detention and before I became a State witness, the Security Police questioned me only about operations that I was involved in and this made me suspicious about whether any of my comrades and sold out on me, as they were not talking of any other operations and knew of all the operations that I was involved in.  At this stage I became concerned and in the belief that I was sold out by my own comrades, felt it easier to handle being a State witness.  I mention this as I am concerned generally about the people in Wentworth and what view they may hold of me when I am released to Wentworth.  I want them to know that I was forced into this situation.\n\t\tI repeat that I am very sorry for all the sorrow, hurt, harm, that I have caused to the victims and their family members as a result of my participation in the various operations.\"",
