<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mohamed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I call Mr Sifiso Malevu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I didn't hear the name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Mr Sifiso Malevu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I can hear you now.  What did you say the name was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Sifiso Malevu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Sorry Mr Chair, Mr Nel would like to know whether he could be excused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am in your hands until when?  Mr Nel, do you want to leave Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> (Indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, can we reassess the situation at about quarter past eleven?  Is that convenient for you?  Okay.  Yes, Malevu, what language would you like to use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">SIFISO MALEVU:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please be seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman. Mr Malevu, isn't it correct that you are presently serving a term of imprisonment at Westville prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Yes, I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> What were you convicted of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I was sentenced for armed robbery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were present when Mr Mpanza testified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Yes, I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you convicted for the same offences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Yes, we were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you.   What term of imprisonment did you receive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Eight years imprisonment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Mr Malevu, did you  make an application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> In 1997, around May.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now you see, tell us, did you make it on a separate form and did you sign that form, or what is the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I used a separate form, which I signed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you tell your Attorney then about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Please explain which Attorney you are referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The one that is presently representing you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I did explain it to her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, what did you tell her?  That you made the application on a separate form, or that you associated yourself with the application of Mpanza and you thought that his application was sufficient to cover you as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I filled in my own form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, we have two versions here, as to how we are not in possession of a completed form as required by the Act.  Are you telling us that in fact the correct version is one, that you in fact completed your own form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> What happened was, I filled my own separate form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and what did you do with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I submitted it to Capt Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where did the story about you associating yourself with one application form, come from then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I do not have knowledge of where that came from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you heard yesterday how we were arguing about it, did you not approach your Attorney and tell your Attorney exactly what the position was?  You were sitting here in the hearing, she made an application at the beginning of this hearing, asking for condonation for you and Shandu to be joined as applicants, despite there being no formal application form, an application before us, and she explained one time, that you believed, you were one of the people who believed that Mpanza's application was in fact an application on behalf of all of you?  Admittedly there was a second version, that seems to suggest what you are testifying now, but that gives us problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>	We would like you to tell us how this came about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> With regards to our applications, sometime last year, I think in July, Mr Cele and Mrs Mkhize arrived at prison to inform me that Mr Mpanza had made an application for amnesty and they enquired if we were also applicants in the matter, or we were just implicated persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>	At that point, I impressed on them that we were applicants, because from what I knew, we were all applicants in that matter.   I was not aware that I was implicated, just implicated in the matter.  They then explained to me that they could not locate our forms.  They said I was then required to make a statement, so that the matter could be processed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Look, all I am asking you is where this other story about a globular application arose from.  Isn't that what you told your Attorney?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I think that that must have come from the people who took the statement from me, because I am not aware of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Malevu, have you read the statement of yours, that appears at page 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 which was signed by you on the 7th of July 1999?  If you look at page 10, is that your signature there?  Page 10?  Is that your signature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Right.    Just bear with me for one second.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Page?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Page 10 he signed.   Have you read that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Yes, I read it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And is that what you told Mr Cele?  You told him the story and he wrote down the statement for you?  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I would like to explain that Mr Cele was writing the statement in English, but I was conversing with him in Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> He is a Zulu speaker, isn't he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So you didn't have any trouble understanding each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> We did not have a problem communicating.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Precisely.  So you related the story and he put it down in English?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> That is correct.  He would write it in English and I would be telling him the story in Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> When he finished writing the story, he asked you to sign it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> After completing writing, he asked me to sign it.  He also asked me if he should read it back to me before I sign it, but I opted not for him to do so, for several reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I will just explain that.   The circumstances under which we live in prison can sometimes make you not to think clearly.   For example, at the time at which Mr Cele was supposed to read the statement back to me, I was supposed to go and get my meal.  In that way, I entrusted the statement with Mr Cele, for the reason that had I missed my meal at that time, I would not have had anything to eat for that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>	The reason why I did not ask Mr Cele to read the statement back to me, was that I trusted him.  For example whatever you are noting down now, I believe that it is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, well, even if you didn't believe it is correct, it is being recorded on the machine and we can always play you back the tapes, but that is irrelevant.  What is important here is has he recorded accurately, apart from this business about your application form, has he reported everything else accurately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As you told him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just a yes or no is good enough.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let me ask you this, have you been able to read that document, that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> No.  Are you referring to today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, any time after it was   ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Malevu, I asked you earlier, had you read this document and you said yes, you understand what is in this document, you have read it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I did read it, but at the time I did not specify when I read it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you satisfied when you did eventually read it, that it was properly recorded as you told Mr Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> After we received the statements from the Attorney,  I complained to her about the portion which pertained to the application.  That is why the matter was taken to the  High Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the first time that you read this document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Yes, it was for the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> It was in March, before we went to the High Court in Pinetown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In March?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> My question to you was, apart from that last portion, everything else in this statement is accurately recorded, is that not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I believe so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now, why would Mr Cele go and write some other total nonsense there that you say is not true?  He was writing it all in one go?  As you were talking, he was writing, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> That is so.  I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And when you had finished talking, he finished writing?  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Please repeat that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> When you finished talking, he finished writing, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And then he asked whether he should read it back to you and you said no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I said "no, I trust you, I can just sign the statement."   Since the time they arrived, we had not experienced any problems, so I had no reason to distrust him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes.   You see, he will say he wrote exactly what you told him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can you tell us any reason why he should make up a lie about what you told him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I am not in a position to explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> He had come there to help you, to take a statement that would help you, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And you understood that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, if I may, this is a convenient spot for me to bring this up, but my instructions at all stages from the applicants were that they filled in separate application forms, and this version about the globular application, came from the affidavits themselves.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Mohamed, I would like to ask you something.  Mr Mpanza makes an affidavit to which he attaches the application of the High Court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yesterday he told us that he doesn't know about the applications of Malevu and Shandu, he wasn't present when they whatever, if they did sign any documents, he wasn't present.  That cut out the idea of a globular application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But yet he says in his affidavit to the High Court that he is able to confirm their versions, how is that possible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> On instructions received, Mr Chairman, it seems that they had discussions about the application, after the applications were made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No.  These affidavits to the High Court specifically states that that paragraph in the original statement is incorrect and what in fact happened is that this witness and Shandu completed separate amnesty application forms, in terms of the Act, but yet, Mpanza says that he didn't know anything about it, he wasn't present when that occurred.  How is he then able to confirm that they completed separate application forms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> The instructions that I received is that he didn't physically see them filling the forms in, but he ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But then how is he able to confirm it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> He says that he is aware that they said that to him, and on that basis he confirmed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> As a lawyer, you know that that, if you are confirming something, you are confirming what you know?  What you saw, that is the purpose of giving evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>"... the facts contained herein falls within my personal knowledge and are true and correct.  I confirm that I have read the first and second applicants' affidavits and confirm the correctness thereof in so far as they relate to me."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>	How is he able to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Mr Chairman, in the first and second applicants' affidavits, they had said that they dealt with this bit about the globular application, and Mr Mpanza merely confirmed the fact that he didn't make the application on behalf of the other two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Malevu, which incident did you apply for amnesty for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> About the incident of the robbery that took place in Empangeni at Avocas Wholesalers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Now, you have earlier said that you have heard the evidence of Mr Mpanza, can you tell us how it is that you became involved in this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I was contacted by Mr Mpanza about the situation that he found himself in at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> What situation was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Firstly, the situation at Mkababa, about the violence that was going on there.   That was the first incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>	The second incident regarded Empangeni.  That is the harassment and attack of comrades in Empangeni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Why did ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just before you go on.  You say he contacted you and he told you about these two things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> At the same time, on the same occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> On different occasions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What did he want from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Mr Mpanza required my assistance in helping him attend to these problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did he tell you, what did he need your assistance for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> The most important issue was the question of acquiring firearms to assist the people who needed them, the people who were being attacked by the IFP at Mkababa, that was the first instance.  That is the sort of assistance he required from me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>	He wanted to know what idea could I come up with to help attend to this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What did you do about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> We discussed the matter on several occasions, trying to identify places where, from which we could obtain firearms, places such as police stations.   We would go and do some reconnaissance at those places.  The people that we could meet and make progress with, were the people who sold firearms, however we did not have money to purchase them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why didn't you go and rob them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why didn't you go and rob them of their arms, why didn't you break into a shop where they sold arms and ammunition?  That would have solved your problem immediately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> We felt that was unsafe.   We did consider it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And yet it was safe to go and rob a wholesalers in broad daylight, early in the morning, eight o'clock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Yes, it was, although it was not a hundred percent safe, however, we felt it was safer than the places we have referred to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What else did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Whilst we were still busy trying to solve the issue of the people of Mkababa, I think after three or four weeks, a report was brought by somebody from Empangeni.  I was not aware who that person was who brought the report to comrade Ziba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>	That person explained their situation in eSikhaweni, that things were not going well.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You misunderstood my question, I want to know what other steps you took to obtain firearms?  You have spoken about discussing robbing firearm shops, you have spoken about discussing police stations, you have discussed the issue of maybe buying firearms, but having no money, what other steps did you take, or is that everything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> We abandoned the idea of robbing gun shops and police stations.  We felt that was unsafe, so we abandoned that idea.   A more suitable idea that crossed our minds was  ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You didn't take any other steps?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> We did not take any other steps about robbing police stations and gun shops.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any other steps about acquiring firearms, that is the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Yes, there were some.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I have asked you about five times now to tell us what other steps you took, and you haven't told us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it correct there were not other steps that you discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> The steps that we took, or the step that we took, was to go rob money so that we could buy those firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Why didn't you take the most obvious step, the one that Mpanza says you took, which was to find, obtain the assistance of other comrades, find out about their DLBs, check what weapons they might have?  He says you did that?  You didn't do it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> We did do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Why didn't you tell us that you did it, before I put this question to you in this way?  I gave you enough chance to tell us what other steps you took?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I thought you were asking about what we intended doing that was close to what I had explained before, that was robbing of gun shops and police stations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Carry on, your record will speak for itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Although I am not absolutely certain of Mr Mpanza's movements of where he went, because we were not always together, however, there were people that I approached and asked, although I knew that it would not be easy to obtain firearms that would be taken to another place on a permanent basis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>	Whoever had a firearm at the time, did not want to part with it, because the situation was not okay, so that if you borrowed a firearm from somebody, you would have to return it after use.  It would have been difficult to obtain firearms from other people to take them to Mkababa permanently, because there were problems around the area that we were in, itself, and the firearms were not many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Mr Malevu, when you were having all these difficulties about obtaining firearms, what did you eventually decide to do to obtain your firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I would explain that whilst we were still faced with the problem of acquiring firearms for the Mkababa area.  I think after about three or four weeks a request came from Empangeni.  Mr Mpanza then sent me to Empangeni to attend to that request.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>	It concerned the killing of ANC comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Mr Mpanza then organised that I should go to Empangeni to meet a certain gentleman.  I think his name was Mayibuya.   We contacted him by telephone prior to my departure for Ngoya, I did not know this person, but he was known to comrade Mpanza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>	We introduced ourselves over the phone and he explained what car he was driving, so I left after arranging a date over the telephone.  I left for Empangeni, where I met comrade Mayibuya.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>	Comrade Mayibuya took me to ESIkhaweni township.  We remained there for a short while.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Mr Malevu, what was the purpose of your going to Empangeni and meet Mr Mayibuya?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Malevu, you heard Mr Mpanza testify about what happened and how this thing was planned, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Yes, I did hear him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you confirm what he says as far as it affects you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there anything you want to change or alter about what he said about you or do you agree with what he said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> From what I heard, I agree with what he said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  Is there any more questions, Ms Mohamed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> No, Mr Chair, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS MOHAMED</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Panday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR PANDAY:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Malevu, was the situation in Mkababa urgent to get firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> It was urgent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Why did you not consider robbing a bank to get these firearms, to get the cash?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Normally banks are situated in public areas where most people could be found.  We were trying to avoid a place which were likely to expose members of the public to a danger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> But wasn't a wholesaler situated next to the public, a place where the public was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> In that area, or that place, is not situated near a public area, there were not many people around there, and even then, the people would be moving around there at certain times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>	The place would be busy at certain times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Did you see who took the weapon of the security guard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Okay, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PANDAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Malevu, I would like to inform you that I spoke to Ms</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>Mkhize yesterday and she confirmed to me that the statement that you and Ziba and Mzwake Shandu gathered and applied for amnesty unilaterally, in one application form, which was signed by Ziba, it is what you have told her.  I just want to put that to you.  She is going to come today and give evidence to that effect, what is your response to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> There is not much I can say about what Mrs Mkhize alleges.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> What I want to know from  you is, do you still insist that you never told her that you signed one application form, and through that you had intended to apply by signing one application form?  I want you to tell me whether you deny that, or whether you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I deny having made that statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Chair, I would like to speak to Mr Cele quickly, because he is the one who took the statement as well, with Mkhize.   He is right next to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How long is that going to take?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> He is right next to me, I just want to speak to him quickly.  Thank you Mr Chair, I am ready to proceed with my cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>	Mr Malevu, my instructions from Mr Joshua Cele, who is sitting next to me, and he will give evidence to that effect is that he did give you the statement and you read through it.  You even requested for a copy, which he faxed to you later on, and it is going to be his evidence that you did say to him that you completed one application form with Shandu and Malevu, sorry and Mpanza, and Ziba Mpanza was the one who signed the application form?  What is your response?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I think there was a misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> What do you mean?  You were both speaking Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And both of you, that is Mr Shandu and yourself, said the same thing, that you completed one application form and by which you had intended to apply?  Where was the misunderstanding, how did you misunderstand each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> There were so many questions that he posed, that is Mr Cele and Mrs Mkhize.  I think that because of the situation of the prisons, those are the factors that contributed to such problems.  I did not say that we forwarded one application form.  All I want to explain is this, the question that was posed to us was that, it was about me filling in the form, and in my form I stated Mr Mpanza, Shandu, Nmezela and Tekozani and even in Mpanza's form, he told me about the information in his form, I think those are such questions that led to some confusion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I just ask something?  Did you request a copy of this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> Yes, I did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And you received a faxed copy as he says you got?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALEVU:</span> I met with Mr Cele at the (indistinct), but I did not receive the copy.   I explained to him and he told me that they couldn't send the copies.  They also had a problem, but I never received that copy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Joshua Cele will give evidence.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you Mr Chair, I have no further questions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Mr Chairman, I am ready to call Mr Shandu, I am not sure if you want to take the short adjournment now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you.  I call Mr Shandu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Shandu, what language would you prefer to use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MZWAKE SHANDU:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please be seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS MOHAMED:</span> Ms Shandu, were you convicted for the same incident that Mr Mpanza and Mr Malevu were convicted of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Did you make an application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Which incident did you apply for amnesty for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> The incident that took place in Empangeni in the wholesaler there, the robbery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> When did you make your application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I cannot remember the date, but I think it was early 1997.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Where were you, sorry which prison were you being detained at this time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I was in Waterval prison, Utrecht.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> How did you make an application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Will you please explain your question further, what do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> You said that you did make an application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What steps did you take to make an application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> In prison, we were being advised on how to forward the amnesty application.  There was a place where one would go there and fill in the forms, and I was amongst those people who did so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> After you filled in your form, what did you do to that form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I handed it to a member who was dealing with such processes in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Mr Shandu, I am going to refer you to the bundle of documents before you.   There is an affidavit that appears in this bundle, the hand-written affidavit appears from page 13 to 16.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>	In paragraph 2 of this affidavit, there is a sentence here which reads -</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>"... although I did not sign any form, I remember that we included our names and Ziba had to sign the application form."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>	Can you explain this, because there is clearly now a different version on these affidavits?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, before you answer that question, were you and Malevu together when you spoke to Mr Cele or were you separate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> We were not together, I was alone in Waterval and Malevu was already in Westville at the time, and I did not speak directly to Mr Cele.  He was only introduced to me.  It was only Sheila Mkhize that I spoke to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Is that your signature on page 16?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can you see that it is dated the 8th of July 1999?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> That is the day after Mr Malevu signed his affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I am not sure whether that is a question or a statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can you see that it is a day afterwards, he signed on the 7th, you signed on the 8th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Where is Mr Malevu's signature, on what page?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Page 10.  Sorry, I should have indicated that to you.  If you look at the bottom of page 10, you will see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>	Do you see where he signed, your lawyer is pointing it out to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, I can see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Do you also notice that the same person attested both statements and that was Mr Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> That is possible that it is the signature of the same person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes.  So Mr Cele must have spoken to you and said "is this affidavit the truth, do you swear that it is the truth" and you would have taken the oath and he would have signed it with you, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> No, that is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did it happen that you signed the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I sent this statement after it was compiled, by Sheila, meaning Mr Joshua Cele and Sheila Mkhize came when I was sick there in prison, I didn't get time to read the whole statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>	I was just satisfied that he had written the statement the right way and decided to sign.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>	I even explained to them about my health condition, as a sick person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I ask you a question, you see next to your signature there is a date, 8 July 1999, did you write that - 1999-07-08?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I do not remember writing the date, I only remember signing the document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Is that your handwriting, is that how you write?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> It is very difficult to identify the handwriting, when it is written in figures, but if it was just a handwriting, words, not figures, it would be easy for me to identify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> How did Ms Mkhize take the statement from you?  Did she ask you questions and then you gave her answers and then you wrote them down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I was sometimes asked questions and sometimes I would be expected to explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But basically she wrote down what you told her?  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I was not looking at her while she was writing, I cannot confirm that she was actually writing exactly what I was telling her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe, what is the position about the other matter?  Have we got any response from the search?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> No Mr Chair, I haven't had any indications from Mr Madlala, sorry from Mr Mpanza, who has gone to follow it up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You haven't received any response?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I haven't had any response.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Your phone has been off in the meantime?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> But Molly would have told me what was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you in the meantime see if Molly can contact him and find out what the position is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Okay, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just to finish off that issue, Mr Shandu, did you read this statement when it was finished, being written?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did she read it to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I cannot remember whether she did that, but as I explained initially, I was not as patient to listen to everything, even if she did that, because I was very sick.  After compiling the statement and I trusted her, I signed the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were a policeman prior to that, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What rank did you hold?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I was a constable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How long were you a policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> For five years at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you were acquainted with the procedures as to making statements and the rights of people making statements and so forth, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you were quite acquainted with the importance of making statements?  Not so, and the accuracy thereof?  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How is it that you paid such a reduced attention to a statement that you were making, which would possibly secure your release from prison?  Why is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> If you are seriously ill as I was at that time, it is possible that such things can happen, because a person in my condition, even if I was supposed to appear in court for a certain offence, that would be postponed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Shandu, you knew that there was a problem with your application, isn't that so?  Because they came to see you as perpetrators, not as applicants?  Isn't that so?  As implicated parties and that is when you found out that there was something wrong with your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Or that you did not make an application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Will you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I understood him, I will try to put it as simply as possible, the reason these policemen and investigators from the Truth Commission had come to see you, was because it wasn't clear whether you were an applicant or an implicated party.  You must have therefore realised as a consequence of that, how important getting the right facts down now, were going to be as to how the Truth Commission would deal with your application?  Isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And yet you, an experienced policeman, knowing what the meaning of affidavits are,  didn't bother to check it?  The only explanation that you can give us is that you were sick?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, I was very sick, and I had no reason not to trust them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Do you think they had any reason to put words in your mouth that were not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I do not know, but that happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You know, it is strange that on two different occasions a similar excuse, if I may call it that, in two different places, is tendered.  It is such an unusual excuse, it is difficult to accept that it was the truth, or that you are telling us the truth now.  It is hardly something to have been made up by the writer of that document, unless he received it from the deponents of that statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>	You see, from what you tell us, you didn't know what Malevu had told him in respect of this mess up?  Is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Will you please repeat, what about Malevu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you made a statement, I think it was Waterval, where was it, where were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> They were both at Westville when these two statements were taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where were you when you made the statement?  At which prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> In July 1999, where were you, at which prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Waterval prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And he was at Westville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And he made his statement the day before you did?  Correct?  We showed you that?  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you didn't know that he had made a statement the previous day, did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> No, I only got that from Sheila and Cele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You didn't know what he said in his statement?  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, I did not know what was in his statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> With regard to the rest of this matter, you have heard the evidence of both Mr Malevu and Mr Mpanza, do you confirm that as far as it relates to you, that it is true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I do remember some of the things, I think that is true, but the testimony, more especially Mr Ziba's testimony took a long time.  I cannot remember everything he said in his testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did you know Ziba before you went on this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes.   We were not friends, we were not as close, but I used to know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> How was it that you just ended up going on this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> At first Malevu came, a person that I used to know very well, and a person who was a neighbour, who were friends, and he came to me to tell me, he actually asked for assistance, weapons, firearms and ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Why would you have weapons and ammunition and firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> In his mind, as a person who was working in the Police Force, he thought that he might get some assistance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you a member of a political organisation at that stage, at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I was just a supporter.  I was not a card carrying member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were a policeman, though?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, as there were other white policemen, who were also supporters in some political organisations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Where were you stationed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I started in Durban North and then I was transferred to Umhlanga Rocks.  The incident took place while I was working at Umhlanga Rocks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What was your role in going on this mission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> While we were ready to leave for Empangeni, they told me that they did not have enough ammunition for the 9mm firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>	I had some that I could give to them and then we left for Empangeni, driving in a car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What was your role on the mission, just to supply ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I was just one of them, and implicated as them in the operation, from the time they approached me, because I was going to play a role when we arrived at the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tell me, you knew that these people were looking for arms, was it explained to you that "look, it is for political reasons"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, I was briefed because they even told me that the money that they were going to get there, was going to be used for a certain purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say you are a policeman at Umhlanga Rocks police station?  Isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I just want you to confirm because I have never worked in a police station, but I understand each police station has a gunnery, or what they refer to as a gunnery, where they put all the guns or an armoury, something like that, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, that is correct, but it is not all the police stations that are equipped with that facility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where did you people in  Umhlanga Rocks police station keep your firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> It is a very small police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where in the police station did you keep your firearms, I did not ask what the size of the police station was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> There was a safe and the only firearms are there for guard shooting, they were not sufficient for the operation that they were going to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many arms were in that safe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I can remember two, HMC and a shotgun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where did you, where were you employed before Umhlanga Rocks, did you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I was in Durban North.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was there an armoury there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, there was, though I did not have access to it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We are not talking about access to it, why do you talk about that?  Anyway, how many guns were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I never counted them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were there many, there must have been many then, if you cannot say how many?  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, there were many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you knew the inns and outs of the police station in Durban North, because you worked there, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Would you please repeat your question, I did not understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You knew what the rosters were and you knew your way around the police station in Durban North, not so?  You worked there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I did not know everything, I only know things that were related to my duties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but you knew there were many guns there, and you knew where it was kept in the armoury there, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As being employed by the South African Police Services, although it was at Umhlanga Rocks, you were able to find out what the rosters were at Durban North, not so?  A few questions here and there, you would know who is on duty and who is not on duty, not so, and when?  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And there would be times that there would only be two people on duty in the charge office, at any given time, especially at night, not so?  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What stopped you and your colleagues from going there to the Durban North police station one night, when only two policemen were on duty, to go and rob that police station of all the guns in the armoury?  That would have sorted out the problem that you people faced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Two policemen who were on night duty, where the police who would be in the charge office, I am not talking about the police who would be patrolling with a van.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>	There was, there has never been a shift with only two people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There would be two policemen to defend the police station in Durban North, at night, you people were four?  Is that not so, or five in fact, maybe?  Why was it so impossible to overcome these policemen, when you knew how to go about your way there in the police station, you worked there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Even if we were then, that was not going to render any help, because they came to the armoury, I didn't even know where it was kept, up until my last day at that particular police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you consider that plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But shouldn't the police on duty have access to the armoury because you never know what happens during the night, police sometimes need the arms?  Is that not true?  So the key must have been in the vicinity of that charge office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> No, that is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So if there was a problem there that the police required firearms, then the Durban North police would not have been able to help, they would be rendered inefficient?  Is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> There would be an R1 that was kept in a safe in the charge office, and one big rifle, but not other key to the armoury.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, have you got any more questions, Ms Mohamed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS MOHAMED</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Chair, I've just got one question.  What portion were you supposed to receive, what portion of money were you supposed to receive, or is just another mistake that was made in your affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> The portion that I was talking about, the money that was to be acquired, it doesn't specify, it was not specified, but according to my agreement with Ziba Mpanza,  it was stated that as a person that was employed, I incurred some expenses during the preparations of this trip, and as a person who had children, I had to, on my way back, I had to be given that money and replace it wherever it came from, it was not that they were thanking me for the role that I had played, or as being played a role in the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If that was not agreed to, would you have participated in the escapade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Besides the agreement, I was already part of this operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now tell me, when you went on this robbery expedition, you say that you knew you had to replace certain moneys, disbursements, why are you unable to tell us what that amount is, because you would have already disbursed it on your way to Empangeni?  You must have known how much you must collect, why are you unable to tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Maybe I did not understand the question, I did not think that the question is about how much was the money that was going to be allocated to me, I apologise for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, the question was very simple, if I remember it correctly.   This portion you were supposed to receive, how much was that, that was the question, wasn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> The money that was supposed to be given to me to pay for the expenses, was R1,000.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why do we struggle to get that answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I thought, I did not understand the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> I have nothing further, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Shandu, it is correct that the R1,000 was for your leaving work for a couple of days, and taking moneys home, for your children, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I did not understand your question, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> When you said the R1 000-00 was for expenses, what expenses did you incur?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I think that even comrade Mpanza made mention of the fact that as we were going there,  we were expecting, we knew in advance that a shoot-out would take place, but as Africans, we normally use special herbs and ntelezi before taking such trips.  I am the one who had money to pay for such facilities, because the comrades that were with me, most of them were unemployed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Now earlier on when you gave your evidence, you didn't mention anything about ntelezi or the herbs, it is only now that I bring it to your attention to clarify expenses.  I recall you mentioned about taking leave from work and the days you were going to miss.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Paying money for your children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Paying money for your children, that is why I mentioned your children, you never mentioned herbs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> It is because no one asked me specifically about the money, the purpose that the money was going to be used for.  This is the first time that this question is being posed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> No, you are now lying, because the Chairman asked you what were the expenses, what was the money for, you said expenses and then you detailed the expenses.  You had a chance to talk about ntelezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> If you say I am telling lies,   I take it that is what is on your mind, but I am telling you exactly what happened there, because I was the one who was there, I am the one who was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Now another curious thing, you mentioned that you joined the Police Force in 1986, to also supply weapons and firearms.  Did you apply for amnesty for these incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> What incident are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Right, okay, in paragraph 3 on page 11, you say the following</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a>"... in 1986 I joined the Police Force."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>	You can listen to me, I am reading the paragraph, it is being interpreted to you.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>"... in 1986 I joined the Police Force and I should supply them with firearms and rounds of ammunition, taken from exhibits."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a>	Are you talking about Ziba and Malevu that you should supply firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> This is one of the mistakes, no one will ever join the Police Force with the intention of supplying firearms, no one accepts that in the Police Force.  I would never make that mistake, joining the Police Force with the aim of supplying the firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> But you say this in your affidavit, you did not dispute this part of the affidavit?  You only disputed the part where the filling of the application form was concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> No person who is sane, who can join the Police Force and supply the firearms in the Police Force, that will never happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Okay, you supplied them with rounds of ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let me put it to you, no sound policeman would embark on a robbery, the public expects but you did it?  Don't come and tell us about the soundness of police minds, answer the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> My question to you again is that, did you supply them with rounds of ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> When I get them, I used to give that to them, but that is not something that I used to have with me all the time, but I would get it and then I would give it to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> So the truth is that before this incident, you used to supply them with rounds of ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Even though we are not talking about the same people, but it happened, it could have happened that any comrade from the ANC, I would assist that particular comrade with such ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Did you get this ammunition whilst employed at the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> We would get, I would get it when I am going to the shooting range.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Right, so as a policeman, you should supply ammunition, that is correct now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I do not understand the question now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tell me, answer this question before you clarify the other one, this bits of ammunition that you used to give to any comrade as you say, were they, was that ammunition Police issue?  Did you get it from the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did you get paid for it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I would get it when I am going to the shooting range, but I did not understand your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you get paid for it when you gave it to the comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Who would be paying me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The comrades who would receive the ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I was not expecting any money from them, because they had nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you get paid at times when they did have money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> No, it never happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So would you expect to be paid if they had money?  You didn't expect it because they didn't have money, however, what about the reverse?  Weren't you selling ammunition and arms to these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I was not selling it to them, and I was not even expecting money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now how did you explain the missing ammunition to your superiors when you give it away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I was never questioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, how did you plan to explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> That was not possible, because if you are going to the shooting range, you are given a certain amount of ammunition, and it is up to you to use all of them or some of them.  You are not expected to bring them back, the ones that were unused, because in the (indistinct) the superiors would think that you had used all the ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That ammunition was marked, isn't it?  Correct?  All SAPS ammunition is specially marked, not so, and it used to be at that time?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I never noticed any marks on the ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you didn't know whether any cartridges could be identified as coming from the gun of a policeman?  You didn't know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Perhaps we should take the adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MZWAKE SHANDU:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR PANDAY:</span> (continued)  Mr Shandu, finally my question to you is that for the incidents where you supplied ammunition and weapons, have you applied for amnesty for those incidents?  I am not talking about the robbery at Avocas Wholesalers, I am talking about paragraph 3, you mentioned you supplied rounds of ammunition and firearms, have you applied for amnesty for those incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> No, I never supplied any firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> The rounds of ammunition that you supplied, did you apply for ammunition for those incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Any particular reason why you did not apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I thought that I was going to get the opportunity when testifying on this incident, I did - it is something that I have mentioned in this same application that I am here about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Did you mention to whom you supplied the ammunition, in the application that you talk about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> No, I cannot remember if I made mention of that, but if it is necessary for me to do so, I can do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Do you know the names of the people you supplied ammunition to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> The one that I referred to in this application, are you talking about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> I am talking about paragraph 3, where you talk about supplying ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Can I please be given a moment to check on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Panday, does it matter to whom he - he has admitted that he has sold to other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Okay, Mr Shandu, finally, do you know exactly what was the operation to take place in Avocas Wholesalers for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, I had knowledge about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> What was the operation about?  Very briefly tell us, what do you know the operation was about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> All I know is that the money that was going to be found there, was to be given to the comrades of Mkababa, to assist them in buying firearms, secondly, Steyn who was working for the Murder and Robbery in Empangeni, was going to be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Okay, thank you.  Nothing further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PANDAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Shandu, I spoke to Sheila Mkhize telephonically and she is on her way to this hearing.  It is going to be her evidence that all the facts written in the statement, on page 11 or page 13 to 16, is information that you gave to her.   Would you like to respond to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> What she had written here, I cannot dispute that she is not the person who wrote it, but some of the things that are written here, I know nothing about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Just for the record, which paragraphs don't you know anything about so that Sheila can respond to those paragraphs accordingly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just before you do, are you saying someone else wrote the statement and not Ms Mkhize?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> What I can say in this affidavit, paragraph 2 I know nothing about that, because I wouldn't write, I wouldn't compile an application form with Malevu and Ziba, while I was in Waterval and they were in Westville.  I think you should have asked herself a question how did that happen, because I was in Waterval and the other two were at Westville prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> What else don't you agree with in this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Paragraph 3, there is something written there that I joined the Police Force to supply them with firearms and ammunition rounds, to me it sounds more like I was a person who joined the Police Force specifically to supply firearms and ammunition, and that is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> It does not say that at all.  It says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a>"... in 1986 I joined the Police Force, and I should supply him with firearms and rounds."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a>	In other words, while you were a member of the Police Force, you used to supply him and I am assuming that him is Sifiso Malevu, who is in the first sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Chairman, the term is then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> If you look at the original, you can see it is him, not them.  It might have been a typing error, but it is clear that it is an "i" with a dot on it and everything.  Whoever translated it, obviously made a mistake, that is why I am reading it from - and therefore it makes sense because he is talking about Sifiso Malevu being his friend, and then he talks about then he joined the Police Force, and then he used to supply him?  Did you not supply Sifiso Malevu with firearms and rounds of ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> No, I never supplied him with firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But you did supply him with rounds of ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> During the preparations for this operation that was to take place at Empangeni, secondly it is possible that  because of one, because I did not write the statement, I did not understand what is being said in paragraph 3, I did not understand that paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a>	To me, I cannot reconcile the two, joining the Police Force and supplying the firearms and ammunition.  If one can explain briefly to me the gist of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> We have explained it to you, I have read it to you, it is very simple.  The gist of it is that you don't agree.  What else don't you agree with in this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a>	While we are at it, did you take rounds from exhibits at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> What exhibit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You are a policeman, for goodness sake, you know what an exhibit is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where did this come from, is it something that the recorder made up?  Is that what you are suggesting, that this is untrue and it is in this statement as a result of a fantasy or fabrication of someone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I don't know, but as far as I am concerned, what I have explained to you is what happened, that is how I used to get the ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It has to be a fabrication then, someone is trying to blame you for something that is not true, and implicating you in something that you know nothing of?  It has to be a lie, if what you are telling us, is the truth?  Isn't it, it is not a question that you don't know, someone put this into a statement that you signed, you say it is not true, you don't know anything about it, so it must have been inserted and fabricated by somebody else, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I do not know that, but as far as I am concerned, I never took any ammunition from the exhibits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you never told anybody that you did so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What else is wrong in this statement?  If at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> For now I have spotted that as a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Okay.  On paragraph 5 of your statement you say that your presence, you say Ziba and Sifiso approached you, requesting for more arms and for your company for an operation that was to be executed at Empangeni, correct and then you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a>"... my presence would assist them in escaping from being searched by the police or even arrest, because as a policeman, I would produce my appointment certificate when necessary."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>	That is correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> Yes, that is true.  Ziba and Malevu came to me, but before that, Malevu came alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> That is fine, but the gist of the matter is that you assisted them, because you were a policeman, and because when they escaped, they wouldn't be searched by the police because you were there, that is the gist of the matter, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHANDU:</span> I was doing the job that I was supposed to do, I was not helping them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> You have put a fair summary of that to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> I say you have put a fair summary of that to him, perhaps you should carry on with something else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes.   Actually I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTEANI:</span> I returned towards the end of 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Did you ever meet Mr Mpanza thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTEANI:</span> I met him either in November or December 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Where did you meet him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTEANI:</span> At kwaMashu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> What did you all speak about when you met him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTEANI:</span> I had left Mkababa to see him because of a problem that we experienced in our area.  There was violence between the ANC and the IFP.  We also experienced problems with the police prior to the violence erupting between the ANC and the IFP, there had been conflict with the police, so that when the IFP came into the picture, this violence escalated.  When I went to see him, I wanted to find out from him if he could assist in the supplying of firearms as well as the training of people in our area, who would be responsible for protecting the community, in other words Self Defence Units.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> What did he say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTEANI:</span> Firstly he told me that it was rather difficult because they did not have weapons.   He informed me that when they came back from exile, they did not have weapons.  I then requested him to try whatever means to secure these weapons because of the extent of the violence in our area.  He then promised that he would see what to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Why did you specifically choose to speak to Mr Mpanza about this problem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTEANI:</span> The first reason was that he is the one person I knew better amongst MK cadres.  Secondly, I regarded him as my Commander, because when I underwent training, he was the Commander at Angola.   Also we worked very closely when we were still members of the kwaMashu Youth League in the 1980's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a>	Another reason was that he was very disciplined in following policies.  Also as a Chairperson of the Youth League, I had to approach somebody who had discipline, who would carry out his activities in a manner that was in line with the policy, that was the reason why I approached Ziba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> When you put this request to him, what was his response?</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTEANI:</span> As I have already mentioned, he said there was a problem of the non-availability of firearms.  After I had further pleaded with him, he promised that he would see what he could do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Did he ever come back to you with progress on your request?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTEANI:</span> We did contact each other on a few occasions, however, he did not specify what steps he was taking, he just promised that I should wait and he would come up with something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> So did he ever come back to you and tell you exactly what, did he ever get back to you with a positive response or a negative response, apart from these initial discussions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> He has just told us that they did contact each other a few times, he never told him what he was going to do, but he promised that he would come up with something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you Mr Lax.  Did he ever get back to you after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTEANI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you ever give him advice as to what to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTEANI:</span> I did not know what he should do or what he could do.  I relied on him as a cadre, so there was nothing that I suggested to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you didn't give him advice or suggest anything that he should do, you had faith in him as a cadre and you left it up to him, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTEANI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just while you are, can you just explain one thing to us.  He put you down as the person who gave him the orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTEANI:</span> I will say perhaps he regarded me as such because of our discussion.  I think he responded to that question when he testified.  I cannot comment on it, because he is the one who wrote it down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, but you regarded him as your Commander, not the other way around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTEANI:</span> The distinction is that Ziba was a soldier and I was more active in politics.   Normally soldiers receive directives from political leaders.  They on their own, do not take initiatives, but they follow directives from political leaders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Then why did you tell us earlier that you regarded him as your Commander?  That is why you went to him, because you regarded him as your Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTEANI:</span> I have explained that he was a Commander in the military.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I have nothing further for this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS MOHAMED</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.   Thank you, you are excused.</p>

<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Mr Shabalala, were you a member of any political organisation during 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> Yes, I was an ANC member as well as being a member of MK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Did you hold, apart from this, did you hold any other particular rank within the organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Can you tell us what that rank was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> I served on the Regional Executive Committee of the Natal Region, I was also   the Head of Security in the Intelligence section.  I was also an MK member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Around 1991, which area were you based in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> At Empangeni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> What was your role there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> As I have mentioned, I was Head of Security responsible for the protection of the leadership in the region and when national leaders arrived at Empangeni, I would be responsible for security.  I was also Head of Intelligence, responsible for gathering information.  I was also Commander of MK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Mr Shabalala, do you know the applicant, Mr Mpanza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> Yes, I know  Ziba Mpanza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> How did you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> I first knew him from kwaMashu where I used to reside.  I also met him in Angola, where I had undergone a training course in shooting as well as in communication.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Mohamed, for the purposes of what I think you called this witness, is it absolutely necessary to read out all his credentials?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, let's get to the hub of the matter then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Shabalala, did you meet the applicant around 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> Yes, we did meet here in Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> What was the purpose of your meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> The primary aim was to discuss a problem of a person known as Steyn and his other name Mtagati, loosely translated a witchdoctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Excuse me?  I didn't hear that last answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The applicant said the primary purpose of the meeting was to discuss Steyn whose other name was Mtagati, and I said loosely translated that means witchdoctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said Steyn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Why did you want to discuss Mr Steyn with Mr Mpanza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> I discussed the matter with Ziba, because he was a sniper.  I was looking for somebody who could kill Mr Steyn, because he was a problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Shabalala, have you made application for any amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> No, I did not.  However, I believe that the leadership had submitted an application which included everyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, they have lost that application, if you did not hear, but be that as it may, I want to point out to you that you had not been subpoenaed by the TRC and in the circumstances, I am not too sure whether you are protected from prosecution.  I want to tell you or inform you that if that is so, you are not compelled to answer any questions that may implicate you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a>	Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on, Ms Mohamed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Now, what did Ziba say to you after you discussed this with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> As a soldier, I had left everything up to him, because the situation was urgent, he promised that he would take action as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Shabalala, I think I have discussed the matter with my colleagues, and we think it is safer to explain the warning I have just given you, much more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a>	You see, to an extent, in terms of the Act under which we sit,  people who testify are protected from further, from having what they said here, being used as evidence in other matters, such as criminal matters, civil matters, in respect of delict.   But we have doubts as to whether you are in a position to claim that protection, and given that, you have been asked questions about an incident in which you may be criminally involved, for example this has already been done, so there is nothing we can do about that, is that you told us that you were party to a plan, a conspiracy to assassinate at least Mr Steyn, who is known as a witchdoctor.  Do you understand that?  Conspiracy is a crime in itself and you are not compelled to answer any questions that may lead to implicating you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a>	Do you understand that?  You don't have to answer those questions which you feel, may incriminate you.  If you have doubts, you can ask me whether you should answer the question or not.  As far as I can, I will help you.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So if you feel that you must answer a question which may incriminate you, please tell us that you have doubts about the answer of this question, and you think it would implicate you and therefore you refuse to answer the question.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Mohamed, you obviously consulted with the witness, I am largely in your hands as to really drive this, to avoid questions that may lead to what we are talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Yes, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.    Mr Mayibuya, you have been sitting in the hearing throughout the hearing, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I must say that I noticed you at the back of the hall, and I got the impression that you appreciated some of the questions that were asked, and the answers that were given, some of which did not even impress you?  Do you want to answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you are aware of what was said here about this incident and how you fitted in there, whatever occurred.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you confirm what was said there in so far as it affects you or don't you agree with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> There is nothing that I do not agree with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't wish to amend anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHABALALA:</span> No, there is nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Mr Chairman, if I may just have a moment.    thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, on that basis, I have no further questions for this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS MOHAMED</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> I have no questions, Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Panday, have you got any witnesses?</p>

<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> Ms Mkhize, is it true that you are the investigator for the TRC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Is it also true that you were an investigator in the matter of Mpanza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Who is the applicant, and Malevu and Shandu, who are implicated persons in this matter?</p>

<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> We have you here just to clarify one discrepancy, or a few issues in this application.   I would start with the statement of Shandu.  Do you remember going to Shandu in prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Can you tell the Committee what led you to go to Shandu in prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> I went to Waterval prison which is outside of Newcastle to obtain a statement from Shandu and also to clarify some points that were not clear in the application of Mr Gerald Mpanza, and also to find out from him what actually transpired in the matter, because he had since been implicated by Mr Mpanza, the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Now, did you take a statement from him?</p>

<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Is this your handwriting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Yes, it is my handwriting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> What language did you use when you were taking the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> We communicated in Zulu with Shandu because I knew that he was a Zulu speaker, I asked him and then he told me that he would be comfortable in talking in Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And then how did it come about that the statement was in English?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Now, as my evidence, I was forced and compelled to take the statement down in English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> I would say it was translated by me from Zulu into English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Okay.  In paragraph 2 of Shandu's statement, he states that he signed a form, sorry he states that although ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's put it this way, in this statement it appears that he signed a separate statement, is that what it says?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> They made a global application for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh, it appears from that statement that Mr Shandu had indicated that he had in fact made an application together with two others.    That is the way to put the question, Ms Thabethe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because exactly what he said is in dispute.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you explain why that appears in that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> I will say Mr Chairperson, whatever appears in this statement, is what I was told by Mr Shandu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He disputes that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> If he does dispute it, then I don't know at what point, because I would say it is a lie, because after obtaining a statement from him, I read it out to him and he confirmed that all that was written down, was true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chair, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Mr Chairman, I have no questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No questions?</p>

<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chair, I call Joshua Cele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Cele, what language would you wish to speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I wish to testify in Zulu, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">JOSHUA CELE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please be seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Cele, is it correct that you are an investigator working for the Truth Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Taking into consideration that you heard my questioning Ms Mhkize, I will take you through to the statement right away.  Did you go to Westville prison to take a statement from Goodman Malevu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> What was the reason for you to go to him and to take a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I was assisting Ms Mkhize in investigating the application of Mr Mpanza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Was Ms Mkhize present when you took the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, she was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Is this the statement that appears, hand-written on page 6 to 10 of the bundle?  I would like my learned colleague, Mr Panday to show the witness please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> The same issue is in dispute, Mr Cele, and I would like you to respond.  Mr Malevu has testified to the fact that it is incorrect what is written on paragraph 10 of his statement, to the effect that they made the same application with Mr Ziba Mpanza and Mr Shandu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> What I put down on the statement was what was communicated to me by Mr Malevu.  I could not have applicated any other thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> What language did you use when you were taking the statement from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> We were communicating in Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> After you had taken the statement from him, did you read it to him, before he signed it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I did and he also read it on his own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Is it also correct Mr Cele, that you faxed a copy of his statement to him later on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Indeed, he requested a copy, however the copy machine was not working at prison, so I went back to the office and faxed him the copy.  He also telephoned me to say that he had received it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chair, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.    Mr Cele, it was Mr Malevu's evidence that after the statement was taken down by you, you asked him whether you should read it to him, is that - sorry and then Mr Malevu said no, because at that time he was going to take his meal and he was pushed for time, and therefore the statement was never read to him.  Can you comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> That is not true.   When we spoke with Mr Malevu, I gained the impression that he was a knowledgeable and intelligent person, to the extent that when he read the statement himself, he requested that I remove some bits that I had written down.  I do not understand how he claims that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where would he have asked for you to remove such?  Is there anything that is removed from the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, on page 8, paragraph 8 on the same page.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The words "from Empangeni" has been removed, deleted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, after he had read it, he said he was not certain that he had resided at Empangeni.  However, he knew the area, that is why he do not stand close to Tekozani when the crime was committed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Mr Cele, this faxed copy that you said you sent to Mr Malevu at prison, he says he never received that, can you comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I would comment.  Mr Malevu used to telephone us to find out what was happening about his application.  On one such occasion, he confirmed that he had received the fax which had been addressed to somebody who worked at the prison.  The confirmation that he had received it, was from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS MOHAMED</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR PANDAY:</span> Just one question.  Mr Cele, when you completed the statement, did Mr Malevu at any stage appear to be in a hurry to get to taking his meals, because he has indicated that he trusted you and that he needed to get to his meals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, we spent a lot of time discussing this issue with Mr Malevu,  we spent about two hours, and it was also in the morning, so I am not certain as to which meal he wanted to take at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Thank you, nothing further Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PANDAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you comfortable with English?</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What time of day did you take this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> It was a mistake that it is not reflected on the statement, but when I arrived, it was around ten o'clock when we started discussing this matter with Mr Malevu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> One last question, when did he start phoning you enquiring about the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> A few days after we had been to the prison, because he had requested that I leave the office telephone numbers for him to contact us, should there be a need.  I would say perhaps after two weeks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you went to see him as an implicated person, he never contacted you about an application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Well, he had never contacted me, as well as for the fact that I was assisting Sheila in this matter, because this was her case.  I was seeing him for the first time on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And he had access to a telephone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I am not certain of prison regulations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, but he was able to phone you, so he must have had access to a telephone to phone you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I will say yes, because I would be speaking to him directly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And he would be able to phone the offices of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission at his own request?</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I think that will be so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, you are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> That is all Mr Chair, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED IN ARGUMENT:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  Very briefly, it is my instructions that the applicants acted and they insist that they did, because of the political situation which existed in Mkababa and Empangeni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a>	Mr Chairman and honourable members of the Committee, I am aware that given the nature of the testimony lead here, it becomes increasingly difficult for me to put forward a concrete basis for submissions, and to say that I have been embarrassed is putting it mildly, but I leave the decision ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I appreciate your position, Ms Mohamed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> On that basis, Mr Chairman and honourable members of the Committee, I leave the decision in your hands.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> They have no real case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> The same applies, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will take time to give a decision in this matter.  I think that brings an end to the roll.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Not really, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What have we got left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Chair, I will start with the matter of Songomoni Pillay, which was on the roll and put it on record that we received a letter from him, dated the 23rd of August 2000 where he withdraws his application, and I would like to put that on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you.  The next matter, Mr Chair, was the matter of Eric Molobe, it is one of the applications that we have had various problems with.  The investigator, Mpume, even wrote a letter explaining the problems she has had with trying to get hold of the applicant.  The applicant was duly notified of this hearing, his matter was set down for yesterday, Wednesday. CHAIRPERSON:   And?</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And he hasn't turned up, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you satisfied that he was properly notified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I am satisfied, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, that matter is then struck from the roll.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Chair, if I may just add for the record, this matter was initially set down on the 14th to the 18th of February 2000, there the applicant did not attend the hearing.  The proceedings continued with regard to other matters, but he never pitched at the hearing.  The same has happened in this one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Like I said the matter is struck from the roll.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> As the Committee pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are there any other matter that we need to deal with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> That is the end of the roll, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then this hearing is adjourned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a>HEARING ADJOURNS</p>
