There are elements that I think would come to the fore in relation to activity that was orchestrated and organised, not confined to Wembesi but throughout the midlands in kwaZulu Natal so I think there would be some reasonable good value for witnesses that would lend more light, shed more light on the circumstances and the situation as they arose in Wembesi.

I must hastily advise you that our concern is to make sure that we hear applications of persons held in custody as quickly as possible.  In fact we have been enjoined by the Act to do that right at the beginning of the life of the Amnesty Committee.  We have not been able to do that as best as we would have liked to.  This Committee is now coming to an end and our main concern is that we don't want to postpone applications of people who are held in custody unless there is a very good reason advanced why their applications should be postponed because they continue to be incarcerated in situations where if the applications are expedited they could have been released or at least the applications disposed of.  Now we are also aware that we'd like to have Mr Mkhize coming to give evidence in support of the applicants' application.  As far as we are concerned, having read the papers, we are not dealing with people who had just come into Wembesi, the applicants had stayed at Wembesi. The applicants were actually staunch members of their organisation.  They were in support of Mr Mkhize's organisation.  They are quite familiar in our view reading from their application of the political situation in Wembesi.  You are, however, not precluded to call in as many witnesses as you wish to support their application at any given stage.  We are satisfied that the requirements of Section 20, sub-section 2(a) do not require people other than the applicants to put us in a better picture, to satisfy ourselves whether they fall within that cluster of the provisions of the Act or not.  We wish to make this quite clear to you at this early stage before you proceed further with your application.  If you persist with your application for a postponement, we are not likely to grant you that indulgence because we feel that issues that have to be ventilated in order to satisfy this Committee whether to grant amnesty or not are peculiar and within the Province of the applicants concerned.",
