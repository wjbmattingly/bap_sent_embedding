The Panel consists of the three of us who you can see.  On my left is Mr Ilan Lax, he is an Attorney.   On my right is Ms Francis Bosman, she is an Advocate, and I am Selwyn Miller, I am a Judge.  Appearing for the applicants are Mr Visser, I don't know if you can see him, with his Attorney, Mr Wagener, Mr van der Merwe and Mr Hugo and Mr Nel.  I think he is behind us here.\n\tAppearing for the victim's family is Mr Wills and appearing for an implicated person is Mr Samuel and the Evidence Leader for the Commission is Ms Thabethe.  Those are the people who would be asking questions.\n\tProfessor, if we could get right into it straight away, unless there is anything that you wish to say before we start?",

I have also been engaged in other areas in relation to facial identification since the mid-1980's, such as the use of superimposition techniques for examining photographs and overlaying them onto images of skulls, to assess whether they belong to the same person.\n\tAnd indeed I have been carrying out research in a number of areas related to facial identification and also the Director of the Human Identification Centre at Glasgow University which was established a few years ago now, initially being in London and then moved up to Glasgow, and where we carried on working in that area, we have been working there ever since.",

I wonder if you could tell us about what you have done in this matter, regarding the skull that is the subject of your video.\n\tThen, once you have explained to us exactly what you have done, how you arrived at your conclusions and perhaps if you can reiterate them to us, then I will ask various legal representatives if they wish to put any questions to you.",

            "Yes.  The process that was carried out, was really in two stages.  We received the skull from, sent to us by Dr Naidoo.  There has been an anthropological assessment of the skull, for example that we were dealing with an African female, and basically we were then asked to carry out a reconstruction based on that basis, which we did.\n\tThe technique we used, was to place the skull onto a platform, acquire the information using a laser scanner by beaming a leisure scanner onto the skull to pick up all the co-ordinates of the skull, which are then transmitted and produced a three dimensional picture within the computer.  This was then used as our scaffolding, shall we say, for us to place a face on top of this skull.\n\tWe use a face of someone of approximately the same type of age group initially, and it acts as a facial mask and that facial mask then moulds onto the underlying skull.  Obviously it doesn't just kind of fit over like a glove, you have to put landmarks on the skull and put landmarks on the face, which correspond to each other, to be able to produce this.  Also taking into account ...(indistinct) data that is available for that particular racial grouping.\n\tSo that was all carried out and we produced a facial reconstruction on that basis.  That was really to see whether the shape of the face would be in keeping with the photographs that we received.  It was ... (break in recording) ...  we used a technique called video superimposition, which has been well established since the late 1970s, and used effectively in numerous court cases throughout the world, this technique.\n\tWhat we do is, we capture the image of the photographs of the person in question, so that they are then recorded and frozen and placed onto a TV monitor.  These are then, remain static as images, and then whilst we have them on the monitor, we then use a quality broadcast camera, that is a camera which is really the highest quality that we have available, so in order to do this, we employ the Media Services Department of our University, that does lots of professional work.\n\tThe quality broadcast camera is then, then takes an image of the skull, which is placed on a universal tripod, this is a tripod which is designed to enable us to move the skull, in order to take the skull in any direction we wish, so that we can tilt the skull forward, we can tilt it backwards, sideways and so on.\n\tHowever, we need to compare landmarks on the skull directly with the photographs, so that we can align these images properly.  The way we do this is we make markings on the photographs, we do this before they are captured, we make markings on the photographs, so that we can align for tilt and rotation, and we do similar markings on the skull as well.\n\tAnd then, whilst having the photograph of the person on the monitor, on the TV monitor, we can also see an image of the skull come onto the TV monitor at the same time, which we can then move around to get it into the same orientation exactly as the other image, and we do this by using the lines that I have mentioned, and the landmarks.\n\tOnce we are satisfied with that, then we can do a direct comparison to see whether there is a contour match with the outlines of both images, match or whether they don't match.  We found this to be a particularly powerful technique, because it also allows us to exclude quite quickly and to give negative identifications.  However, I have to say that one of the difficulties, if the person has a reasonably normal face, is that if they match in every respect, we still cannot say a hundred percent that it is that person, but we can ...(indistinct) very strong evidence, that we believe that there is an excellent match, as with the case here.\n\tObviously if we have more than one photograph, we are then in a position to improve the situation slightly and confirm our contour match, say in one view, as we did in this case as well.  We used two views and we were able to get a good match with both views.  And so really, that is the extent of my work, I then produced a video recording for your purposes, so that it could demonstrate what we did.",

The technology has improved, because we have good quality broadcast images that we can put on screens and we can manipulate these images, magnify them much more accurately and check them more accurately, and when we magnify images, we can see better detail when we are matching.  So it has improved from that point of view.  Perhaps also - I hate to say it, but after doing more and more cases, as we go on looking at these and we have accumulated more, then we get the experience.  That obviously counts for a lot, seeing a lot of these cases, seeing where we fall down and where we can improve things, and from that point of view, we are therefore more confident in the work we carry out, than we were, say a number of years ago.\n\tAs we pointed out in the one misidentification that was done, that was only on one photograph that was done, and it wasn't standardised, to the extent that this one was, where the line is drawn and the points marked out, and so on.

However, if - there may also be a very remote possibility that if you provide me with more photographs, that it may make it less, slightly less shall we say, likely.  It all depends.  I mean I really - if I see more photographs, it gives one a much more accurate appreciation and we get more and more towards a positive or even possibly exclusion, but in this case, I believe we will get more towards a positive, I mean that is my own personal view.  But I would, if I had more photographs now, probably I would say it would be difficult for me personally to carry out this test again, I would get another expert to do it, because I have already given an opinion on this case based on the two photographs, and I mean you know as well as I do, the difficulties in getting a witness to repeat something on which they already have an opinion on.",
