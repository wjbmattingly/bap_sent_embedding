<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> My name is Sewpal, spelled S-E-W-P-A-L and the initial is V.  I appear for the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Sewpal.  And the Leader of Evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I am Zuko Mapoma, the Evidence Leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Mapoma.  Yes, Mr Sewpal, is there anything you want to put on record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Thank you.  I think it's quite clear that the applicant is bringing an application for amnesty on the basis that the offence that he committed was committed with a political motive, or political objective.  I think that we have the duty to begin and in the circumstances I will call the applicant.  It will possibly be necessary for me to call two witnesses as well, those were the other accused that participated in the offence who are also here today.  I call the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, Mr Sewpal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">SIBUSISO ERIC TSHABALALA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sewpal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR SEWPAL:</span> Mr Tshabalala, how old are you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> 35 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Where did you live during 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Estcourt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Were there any political parties that were active in that area during that period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, there were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Which parties were these?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> The IFP and the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Were you a member or sympathiser of either of these parties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I was a supporter of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> What other political party was active in the area at the time, you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It was ANC and IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Do you recall what the relationship was between these two parties at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> There was no good relationship, there was violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Were you involved in any violence with the IFP, or are you aware of anybody else that was involved in any violence with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, there were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Sorry, I'm not sure, were you involved in violence or do you know of somebody else who was involved in violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, there are people that were involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Is there any particular person that you want to tell this Committee about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> There were people who were fighting, ANC and IFP people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Alright.  Did you get yourself involved in the murder of the deceased in this case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Did you participate in the killing of the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Now, could you please tell us very carefully and slowly how you got yourself involved in the killing of the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> The deceased was selling guns to the IFP.  Mandla's mother was killed because of IFP, killed her using those weapons which they've bought from the deceased.  We went to the farm because we were looking for the guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Could you at this point tell us who is Mandla, who you mentioned just now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Accused number 1, Mandla Khuzwayo, the one who is here behind me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> What happened to his mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> They killed her and they burned down the house together with her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Okay.  Please proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> After they killed Mandla's mother, we went to the farm because we were looking for guns.  When we arrived on that farm, we found a white man.  He wasn't inside his house, he was near the kraal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Can you tell me, you said when "we" arrived, who else are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Pilane Mutshiako, Mandla Tshabalala, the three of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Now what did you go to this farmer's place for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> We were looking for guns or we wanted guns in that farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> And how did you plan to get these guns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> We planned that on our arrival there, we will catch the white man and take his guns.  Our intention was not to kill him, but to take his guns from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> What did you want to do with those guns?  Why did you want to take them away from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> We needed them in our organisation.  We were the ANC and we didn't have guns, but IFP had guns because the white man was providing them with those guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> As far as you were aware, do you know where this white man was getting his guns from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I don't know where he was getting the guns but all I know is that he was a soldier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> How do you know that he was a soldier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Sometimes we will see him in soldiers uniform.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> And now did you actually see him supplying firearms to the IFP, or how do you get this knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I was told so by Thulane Mutshiane, my co-accused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Now you mentioned in your amnesty application form that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>"We did see him on one occasion where he sold hand guns and rifles to Inkatha Freedom Party supporters."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>Is that statement correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, it is true, but he was seen by Pilane Mutshiako.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> But did you see him as well, or was it only Pilane who saw this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Pilane saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Okay, so it's incorrectly recorded in the form then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Okay, proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> We arrived in his farm.  He grabbed me and he pulled me down and he stood on top of my body.  Pilane Mutshiako came with an iron and hit him on his back of his head and then he fell down.  As he was lying down, we started stabbing him, whilst he was lying down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> What happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> After we finished stabbing him, there was a dog near his body and that dog didn't want to leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> As far as you are aware, was the deceased still alive at this time, or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I think he was dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Okay.  Proceed please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> We cut his body and we removed his liver and we gave the dog his liver because we wanted the dog to eat that liver so that it's attention is towards the liver and not to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> What did you do thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> There was a fire in his house.  We took his body and we threw it in that boiler room.  We saw a car approaching and that car was with police.  We ran away and as I was inside the house, the police saw me and they took me from that house.  I was on top of the wardrobe inside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Before the police vehicle, did you at any stage enter the house of the deceased, you or any one of the other accused with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Before the police arrived, I didn't enter his house.  I only entered his house when the police approached.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> I see and did you find any firearms in his house or in the vicinity of his house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No we didn't, we looked for them but we didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Okay.  What happened thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Police came and they arrested us.  We were taken to the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> How do you feel about the fact that you assisted in killing this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I feel a great remorse about my actions and I would like to apologise even to the deceased and to God and the family.  I know that what I've done wasn't the right thing to do.  It is very sad and also I would like to apologise to the community at large.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> What would you say your motive in killing the deceased was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It is because of the violence that started when IFP killed Mandla's mother and in my view, we blamed the white man because he was selling guns to the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> That is the evidence of this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SEWPAL</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Sewpal.  Mr Mapoma, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, Chairperson, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Mr Tshabalala, I take it that you were not involved in the violence between the ANC and the IFP, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That's correct.  I only took part when I saw that it was getting worse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Can you just explain, what did you do when you saw that violence was getting worse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I don't understand your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you say you did not get involved in the violence that was taking place between the ANC and the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> And you only got involved when you saw that it was becoming worse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> What I did is my participating in the killing of this white man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Sir.  And I take it that you were not a member of the ANC?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It is not correct because I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> But when you were asked whether you were a member of the ANC you said you were a supporter, isn't it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I'm a supporter.  I don't know whether it's different in English or Zulu, but what I said is ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Let me help you.  You were not a member of the ANC, but you were the supporter of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> You did not know the policies of the ANC did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Not every policy of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Were you aware that the ANC had no policy that the white man must be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I would like the interpreter to interpret this thing for me again.  I don't understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Let me put it like this.  The ANC had no policy that white men had to be killed.  Were you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, I didn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> When you went to that farm, you have said that your intention of going there was to get weapons.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And you went on to say you had no intention to kill him, do you recall that as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, why did you kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It is because he started fighting with me.  He was killed by mistake, after we realised that he was fighting.  We started killing him when we saw that he was attacking us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Was he armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, he was.   He had two iron rods in his hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Are you saying he had one iron rod this side and one iron rod this side? Is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, that's what I'm saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Oh and were you armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> We were armed with knives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Who had a knife, was it you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> The two of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Each of you had a knife, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Were you the only two who were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Three of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And what did the third one have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> He had a pipe, that's the pipe he used to hit the white man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Is that Mutshiako?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, it's Mutshiako.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You said he hit him on the neck with the pipe and the deceased fell down to the ground?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, he hit him in his head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Yes, but why did you kill him?  Why did you stab him whilst he was lying on the ground, if it was not your intention to kill him?  You had not gone there to kill him, you had gone there to get arms from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.  The reason we did so, it was because we were scared that he was going to kill us if we were going to stab him, because he was fighting us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> But was he not lying on the ground when you started stabbing him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, he fell down, but we were scared that he might wake up and shoot us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> He was lying on the ground and there were three of you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You were still scared of one man who was lying on the ground?  He had been struck with a pipe on his head and there were three of you, you were still scared of this man, why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It is because we knew that he was a man with weapons.  He was a man who is always armed with guns and he was a soldier, a trained soldier, this is why we were scared of him, but our aim was not to kill him when we went there.  The reason we killed him is because he was fighting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Yes, but he didn't have a firearm when he was lying on the ground, did he?  Did he have a firearm in his hand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, he didn't have a gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> He was an old man and you were three strong men with knives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> He was strong.  He was a strong man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry Mr Mapoma.  Who was supplied with firearms by this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Pilane Mutshiako knows the people he gave, or he supplied the firearms to because they were neighbours to Pilane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When you went to attack him, how long had he been supplying IFP members with firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I wouldn't be able to say, but when I first knew about this it was in 1989, Pilane told me that in 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you in fact search for firearms after you had killed this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> We tried but then police came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What is the answer?  Did you in fact - you didn't search for these arms did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> We did.  We did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Where exactly did you search for arms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> At first we looked for the guns in his car because his car was parked outside and we didn't find and then even inside the house, we didn't find guns and police came, then we couldn't continue with our search.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Mapoma.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I thought in your evidence in chief you said that when police arrived, you ran into the house to hide there.  Didn't you say so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I said so.  Police came and I ran inside the house, but it was the three of us.  The others went inside the house to look for guns and I was in the car searching for the guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So it is only after the police arrived that you got into the house?  Is it not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I only went inside when I saw the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So you never searched for weapons until the police came?  Is that what I get from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Just me, I didn't go inside the house before the police came, but my co-accused both of them, went inside the house before the police came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> But you have just only said that you went to search for the weapons only when the police came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I didn't say so.  I said I searched for the guns inside the car, my co-accused, both of them, went inside the house to look for the guns.  I only went inside the house when I saw the police approaching.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Who searched for the guns inside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Pilane and Mandla.  Pilane Mutshiako and Mandla Tshabalala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Why did you not get in and search yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> At first I went to the car because the car was there and I was searching for the guns under the seats.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> That was after you had killed this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And that was after you had cut his body and removed his liver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And in fact after you have already put his body into the boiler.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Then it is only after that, that you decided now to go and look for these weapons that you want?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And you did not get those weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, we didn't get them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I suggest that you never went there with an information that there were weapons there because there were no weapons and there was no such information at all for that matter, what do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> We went there to look for weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Why did you remove the liver from the body of the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> The dog wanted to bite us and we were scared that if we had to move, the dog was going to bite us, therefore we removed his liver in order to give it to the dog and the dog did exactly what we thought because after we gave the dog the liver, it left us alone and it started eating that liver.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is there any other reason why you removed the liver from his body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, there isn't, this was the only reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Do you know that the police found human parts in small bottles in the house?  Do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No. I don't know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Didn't you hear evidence in the court where it was said that the police searched the house and they found parts of a human body in small bottles and in a bowl in the kitchen?  Didn't you hear that at the hearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I did hear of such in court, but we didn't do such a thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Who was responsible for cutting the various part of the body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Pilane Mutshiako.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Was he the only one who did that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> The three of us were present, but he's the one who did this, then I will say all of us did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Who came up with this idea that the body of the deceased should be cut in the manner we have been told?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No one came with this idea, it was something that just happened, we didn't discuss about this, it just happened at that moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Who was the first person to cut the body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I don't remember very well who actually cut, but I will say all of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you cut any particular part of the body, you personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, I didn't cut any part of his body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What did you do when your colleagues were busy cutting the parts of the body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I was present.  I think I cut with them in his stomach, I only cut his stomach, but I don't remember removing any part from his body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did any one of you talk whilst the body was being cut?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No one said anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is that to say that you quietly cut off the various parts of the body, no conversation whatsoever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, it was like that, because we didn't want to make any noise there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Mapoma, we've interrupted you, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, Sir.  What other parts of his body were cut, were removed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> And also his scrotum was removed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Which part was removed first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> The liver.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And it was thrown to the dog and the dog then ran away, isn't it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Would you please repeat that for me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> The liver was removed from the body, thrown to the dog and the dog then concentrated on the liver and left you alone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, also the scrotum was removed and given to the dog so that the dog could leave us alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Why did you not mention the scrotum in your evidence in chief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, they were removed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, but why did you not mention that in your evidence in chief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I think I made a mistake because I thought I told you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So after removing those parts of the body, you took the body into the boiler.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> For what reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> So that no one discovers his body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And so that, just - sorry.  Why did you not want his body to be discovered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Because we were scared that if his body will be discovered we might be arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> But does it make sense, Mr Tshabalala?  The body was going to be discovered anyway, because the body was not going to be destroyed, was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Now that you are saying so, I think you're right, but at the time this is how we thought.  We thought that his body may be totally destroyed into ashes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> You must have hated this white man, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, because of the situation and because of his participation in giving the IFP weapons and having IFP killing Mandla's mother, this is why we hated him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Mapoma.  Has the Panel got any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> I have no questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Just one.  Can I take it, from what you've said, that the deceased had been supplying weapons to the IFP for quite some time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I only knew the deceased in 1989 when I came to visit Pilane and Pilane briefed me, told me that it has been a long time he's been doing this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Yes, he told you that he had been supplying the IFP with firearms in 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> When I first met him in 1989, that's when he told me so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Had any action been taken against him before this particular day when you went to attack him on his farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> We tried to get hold of guns, but then we failed, then we decided to go to him and take his own guns.  We tried.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> In other words what you are saying is at the time you went to attack him at his farm, no action had been taken against him for supplying the IFP with weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, we didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Yes, it was the first time that an action had been taken against him for supplying the IFP with arms, it was the first time.  Nothing had been done about this before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> We wanted to go and speak to him, but then we decided not because we didn't have guns, because we were scared that he will shoot us if we go there unarmed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Tshabalala, how long did you spend on this farm before the police arrived and arrested you hiding in or on top of the wardrobe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It wasn't a long time at all, even though I may be unable to estimate in hours, but it wasn't really a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could it have been a day, 24 hours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, definitely not a day.  It wasn't a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That seems to be what the court found that tried you.  You seemed to have spent about a day on that farm between the attack and the time that the police apprehended you eventually.  You say that is not right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, it is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you find any alcohol on the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I think I do remember Pilane holding a bottle of alcohol when the two of them went inside to search for the guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what happened to that bottle of alcohol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> They drank it, both of them.  Since I do not drink, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did they drink it before you cut up the body parts of the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It was after because the only time they went inside the house to search for the guns, it was after the deceased had been cut and I was searching the car, that's when they got hold of this bottle of alcohol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were charged, and according to the case that was presented to the court by the prosecution against you, you were charged with having severely mutilated the body of the deceased, in fact according to the summary of the case that was made against you, you were charged with having cut out the eyes, the heart, the liver, and the fat from the deceased's body and to have also severed his penis and his scrotum, was that what you were charged with having done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> The prosecutor said so in court, but it was a mistake because this is not exactly what we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And my colleague Adv Bosman, has already raised with you the fact that apparently some body parts were found in bottles and some other container inside the farmhouse.  Do you say you know nothing about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, I know nothing about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And according to the evidence of the police who arrived at the farm, the heart of the deceased was found lying outside the house.  Do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I didn't see anything like that at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say that's impossible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It is actually really impossible, because we didn't do such a thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The trial court also drew a conclusion that the body was mutilated and these body parts, these organs were removed from the body for the purpose of having muti.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Perhaps I should just point out that in terms of the Appellate Division judgement, the court there felt that the court below was not justified in coming to that particular conclusion because there wasn't sufficient evidence to justify that finding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, that is so, that is the view of the Appeal Court, but I'm talking about the situation at the trial court and I want your response on that.  That's what the court that tried you, the first court that heard your case, Judge President of this Division at that stage, that's what he found.  He drew the conclusion that all this happened because you were looking for muti, now do you wish to comment on that at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> The truth is we didn't do that and I also don't know anything about needing organs to make muti, this is what police thought, but it was nothing like that.  We don't know why they came to that conclusion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was the only thing that you did to the body, to remove the liver and the scrotum to throw to the dog so as to prevent the dog from biting you, that was all you did, if I understood you correctly.  Was that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, that's correct and that's the only thing we did in that body, the rest I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the rest couldn't have happened, you say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, it didn't happen and it couldn't have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, yes thank you.  Mr Sewpal, have you got any re-examination?</p>

<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sewpal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Thank you.  I would like to call Mandla Richard Tshabalala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MANDLA RICHARD TSHABALALA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Sewpal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR SEWPAL:</span> Mr Tshabalala, where did you live, in which area did you live during 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Thabamhlope in Estcourt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Were you a member or supporter of any political organisation at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Supporter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> On which organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Was there any other political organisation that was active in your area at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes there was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> And what was the relationship between these two organisations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Conflict between the two organisations, the ANC and the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Okay.  And did you or anybody in your family ever get caught up in any conflict with either one of these parties during that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I went once in a meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Okay, what sort of problems were there between these two political organisations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> They were fighting, shooting each other. and most of the time the IFP was shooting the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Okay.  Were you as an ANC member or any other person that you knew, closely involved in any of this violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> I think the problem there is you put two questions together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I only attended one meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> I was just saying you put two questions to him, you've combined them.  Why not start the first part of the question, then the second part?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> I apologise for that.  Did you or any person closely associated with you, get involved at any level in any of the violence with any of the political organisations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No.  The only time I was involved was when I attended a meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Okay.  Now you were found guilty of being involved in the murder of the deceased in this case, do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Now how did it come about that you were involved in this killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> The problem only started when my mother was killed by IFP and they were also hunting me down, they wanted to kill me, therefore I went to accused no 2 in order to hide and in order to have solutions on the problem and I told him my problem and they came out with an idea that there was a white man who had guns and if we can go there, we can go and tie him up and get his guns, but when we arrived in his house, it didn't happen as planned because he saw us first and then he ran, he wanted to run inside his house.  We blocked him, he couldn't get inside his house, because he was looking for his gun.  We didn't want to let him inside his house because we were scared that if he did, he was going to grab his gun and start shooting at us.  Accused number 2 hit him with a stick and then he fell down.   We started stabbing him and then he died.  We got scared after we realised that he's dead, then we decided that we should burn his body, so that they don't discover his body but then we realised that his dogs were there, that's when we started cutting his body.  We cut off his liver.  We gave that liver to his dogs and then the boiler was hot and we started searching his house for guns and my co-accused searched his car and we couldn't get hold of any guns.  As we were there, police came and they started searching us.  They asked us why we were there.  We told them we were there because we wanted to buy the cattle and police started searching the house and the yard.  They realised that there were blood stains and they also saw the dog and then the white man's employee came and they said they saw us getting in his house, that's how we were arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Now can you tell us what was your motive in going to the deceased's house on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> We went there looking for firearms because we knew that he was the one who was supplying IFP supporters and members with firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> So would it be correct to say that if you took the firearms away from the deceased, you would effectively cut off the supply of firearms to the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I was trying to protect my family because I had lost so much at that time.  I never took part in violence but they came and they killed my mother and they burned down my house and then knowing that that white man was supplying weapons, then I decided to go to his house to get hold of those guns, but my aim was not to kill him because he was strong and he was a soldier.  I never had any intentions of killing him.  All I needed from him were his guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Now how did you know that the deceased was supplying firearms to the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I saw him twice, even though he only saw me when he died, but I saw him twice doing that.   He used to come in my neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Now apart from the liver, did you or any of the other accused cut up any other part of the body of the deceased and remove any parts from it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It was just the liver and his scrotum.  In fact when his scrotum was cut, we asked each other why would we remove that, because it's not fair and then we decided that we should burn his body.  That's when we realised that this was a serious crime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Are you aware that the police said that they found certain human body parts in small bottles and in a bowl inside the house of the deceased?  Do you know anything about those parts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, police said so, but I personally know that they were just saying something they don't know because police searched the house and we saw them even taking the deceased's money in front of us and some other stories, they were just putting them as if we were the ones, but we saw them doing that.  Police took almost everything in his house.  They actually vandalised his house.  They took car parts and all of this they put down as if we took is and they were calling us monsters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Now after you placed the deceased's body in the boiler, what happened next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> We didn't even look at his body, we left his body there.  We went to his car and we also went inside the house to search for the guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> And did you find any guns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Unfortunately we didn't even find any guns.  I was actually surprised because I thought that we were gong to find more guns.  I couldn't even trust my friend when he told me he couldn't find guns inside the house and then I went inside the house as well and searched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> How long after that did the police arrive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> More than an hour.  I think it was more than an hour, it wasn't a short time, it was a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Did you also find some liquor in the deceased's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> And what did you do with it, if anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Myself and accused number 3, we drank that alcohol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> How do you feel about the fact that you killed this person on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I feel remorse and I would like God to forgive me and also the deceased.  What happened was terrible, but later when I looked at this, I saw that this was just like death, one doesn't know when he or she is going to die, but I'm actually feeling remorse and this is why I came here, to tell this Commission.  I think I actually harassed and put the deceased in terrible pain.  It was better to take his guns, not to burn his body and not to kill him.  I am here simply because I need forgiveness from God.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Had your mother not been killed during 1988, do you think that you would have still been involved in this killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, I wasn't.  The reason I did this, it was because I had no shelter, I will go to accused number 3 and ask for shelter and go back home and there was no home, because my mother had been burned, the house had been burned down and I was left with no-one, no shelter, no-one.  My family was gone and I was in trouble, I was in serious problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SEWPAL</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Sewpal.  Mr Mapoma, have you got any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, Sir, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Mr Tshabalala, did you apply for amnesty for this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, initially I didn't put amnesty application, but later I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> What ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I am sickly.  When they put amnesty applications, I was in hospital, I wasn't in prison and then later when I came back I put my application forward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Suppose that you received the firearms, what were you going to do with those firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I was going to ask my co-accused to go and kill those people who attacked my home and killed my family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So you want to get these firearms in order to revenge the killing of your mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Before you cut the parts of the deceased person, where was the dog?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> In front of the car.  He had it tied there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Interpreter did you say it was tied there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The dog?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Yes, the dog was tied up there in front of the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> How far was the body from the place where the dog was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Very close, like from here to the other room and the car was parked next to and the boiler ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Would you point out how far the dog was from the body, just give an indication in this room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I can try.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, please do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> From here to the other room, that light outside through that door, that light which is lit outside that door and there's a boiler there and the car there and the dog.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Tshabalala, can't you show in that way, in that direction because we can't see behind us now, our vision is not open to where you're pointing.  Can you point from where you're sitting towards the back of the hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> From where I'm sitting to the corner of the room, the car is right here and the boiler is there.  It's not far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the distance between where the dog was tied up and where the body was lying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> The car was parked right there.  In front of the car there's a dog and then the body was closer to the boiler and then there's a dairy in the middle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now is the boiler where you are sitting, more or less, and is the car in the corner at the back there of the hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> The boiler is right where the applicant is seated and the body is right next to the boiler and then the car and the dog is right at the corner of the room and we took the parts from where I'm seated and then we went to that corner and gave the dog those organs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I understand.  It's a sort of a distance of about 15 metres, I should imagine, that the applicant is trying to point our from where he's sitting towards the end of the hall, but we've got the idea.  You say in between there was a dairy as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, there's a dairy as well, next to the boiler, it has been a long time, I'm not certain about my estimations.  It wasn't far from each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well, thank you, we have a picture of what you are explaining.  Sorry, Mr Mapoma, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Sir.  And how far was the dog from the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> The dog was very close to the car in front of the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Was it about the gentleman behind you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, exactly like that, the one behind me is the car and in front here, where I'm seated, that's where the dog was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's about a metre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And that is the car where Sibusiso Tshabalala was searching the weapons, is it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> You say in your evidence you said after your mother was killed, you went to seek advice from your co-accused and they told you that there's a white man ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And then they told you that there is a white man who has got guns, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, accused number 3 told me so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And that is how you learned of the deceased person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Chairperson, I have no further questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Mapoma.  Has the Panel got any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Yes, Chairperson.  Mr Tshabalala, if you look on page 21 to 23 of the bundle there's a statement which it would appear you made to the TRC investigator.  Do you see that?  It seems as though it's your thumbprint there.  Do you remember making this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Now in that statement, it states that you said the deceased was the first person who fired at the applicant when we entered the gate, is that correct, that the deceased fired first?  In paragraph 2, it's typewritten on page 19.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, I didn't say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And then it says, paragraph 3, that you said that no parts were removed from the body.  Did you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, I don't think I've said so.  I don't know, maybe it is because when they came I was sick, but I don't remember saying such a thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And in paragraph, it says that you said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a>"I learned when I was in Westville Prison that the applicant was a member of the ANC"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> What I said is that I knew that he was a supporter, he didn't have a membership card of the ANC but he was a supporter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> So if I can just go back to paragraph 2, you said that Pilane had intended to buy cattle from the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I have no knowledge of this and I cannot comment on something that I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Your attack on the deceased when you went to raid his home on this day, did you consider that to be some for of revenge on him because he was supplying arms to the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, it wasn't like that.  What happened was a mistake, we were just defending ourselves because we knew that he was a person who had firearms and we were scared and also the way he was fighting us, one could tell that if he could get a chance we were going to die.  He was fighting very strongly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Before you came to this farm, did you have any intention in your mind to assault the deceased?  Was this part of your plan at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, our aim was, we were going to hold him and just tie him up and take his firearms, but it didn't happen that way because he was very strong and he was fighting and it looked like if he could have got a chance he was going to kill us, that's what caused his death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Before you came to this farm, or let me put it this way, when you took the decision to go and attack the deceased, did you know the political affiliation of your co-accused, the other two gentlemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I knew that they were supporters, that's why I went to them and that's I was sharing ideas with them because I knew that they were supporters of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you also drink the liquor on the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I did, in fact most of my participation was after I had drunk, like putting his body in the boiler, this happened after I had drunk.  When I cut his body, it was after I had taken alcohol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you at any stage discuss this plan that you and your former co-accused had with ...(intervention - speaking simultaneously)</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> You mean before the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, we sat down and we talked about this.  We discussed about this because we had a problem.  We needed firearms and that's why we chose the deceased, because we were looking for firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but apart from discussing it amongst yourselves, did you discuss this idea, this plan with anybody other than amongst the three of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It was our secret, the three of us.  We didn't reveal this to anyone and also the fact that I didn't have any shelter and these were the people who were helping me, so I asked them to help me and I told them that the people who had killed my family were after me, they wanted to kill me, therefore I went to them and we spoke among ourselves that we were going to go to that farm and take the guns and the plan didn't include murdering the deceased, but it was all about taking his guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Have you got any re-examination Mr Sewpal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Sorry, no re-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Tshabalala, you're excused.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> I call Pilane Thembo Mutshiako.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just give us a minute.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">PILANE THEMBO MUTSHIAKO:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR SEWPAL:</span> Mr Mutshiako, where did you live during 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> In Estcourt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> And do you know the previous witness Mandla Richard Tshabalala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Where did he live during that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> He resided at my home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Were you at that stage a member or supporter of any political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> I was an ANC supporter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Now can you tell us why the previous witness, Mandla Tshabalala was living with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> He came to me and he was in distress that his mother had been killed by Inkatha.  They had also burned down his home.  That is how he came to live with us,</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Okay.  And you were convicted of the murder of the deceased in this case, together with two other people.  Can you please tell us how it came about that you got involved in the killing of the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> When I came upon them, the deceased was on top of accused number 2.  That is when I assaulted him with a pipe on the head twice.  He fell off and then the other person, Mandla Tshabalala, came and also stabbed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Can you tell me why you got involved in the killing of the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> It was not our intention to kill him, but we were looking for firearms.  On seeing that he was fighting and accused number 2 was now below him, I also saw intestines protruding, I could not tell whether they belonged to the white man or accused number 2.  That was when I hit him on the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> What made you think that the deceased had firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> He usually sold the firearms to Stanley Ngombe.  He would come to our area regularly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> How do you know this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> I was once employed by Stanley because he owned a shop and his shop was burned down because of the violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Now which organisation did this person Stanley belong to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> He was initially an IFP member, up until his death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Do you know when Mandla's mother died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> I was informed by Mandla that his mother was burned when the house was also burned down.  I did not get information about other injuries that she sustained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Okay.  Now what did you want these guns for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> We would have used them to pay revenge on the IFP member who had burned down Mandla's home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Okay.  Now could you describe what happened when you got to the deceased's home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> When we arrived the white man ran into a dairy.  He then closed all the doors, there were three of them, so each one of us stood outside a door.  He tried to get out using the door at which accused number 2 was standing.  He had two iron pipes in his hands and they started fighting and on our arrival, we found that the white man was on top of accused number 2 and there were intestines protruding and you could not tell whether they belonged to the white man or accused number 2.  We then assaulted him twice on the head with an iron pipe and he fell off, at which time Mandla stabbed him twice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> What happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> Thereafter we looked for a key to his home and on our way, we encountered a dog that was tied next to a vehicle.  We then went to his body and cut out the liver and his scrotum and the penis, which we threw, we threw the liver to the dog.  The rest were just left in a container.  The dog did not eat the rest because it had moved from the vehicle.  We then went to the vehicle, found the key, then went into the house.  Mandla and myself searched inside the house for the firearms.  We didn't find guns, we just found ammunition.  We then came across a bottle of alcohol which we drank up.  We would go out to look outside.  Accused number two was still searching in the car.  We would also go out to assist him there.  We then decided that we should take the body to the boiler room.  We then put him there to burn him and we thought that his body would be burned to ashes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> What would you say was your motive in going to attack the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> It was the acquisition of firearms.  That was all we wanted because that is what we had discussed and agreed upon.  We had not intended to kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> And you wanted to acquire those firearms, for what purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> There was an ANC chairperson in the area, Mr Stanley Ngombe, we had intended to attack that Mr Ngombe and any other IFP member who would come out supporting Mr Ngombe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Did you remove any other body parts from the deceased's body, apart from that which you've mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> I would not be in a position to dispute or admit that because we had drunk alcohol, we were drunk by that time, so there was nothing that I could, at the time, see clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Now, you made an application for amnesty yourself, during 1996, did you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Now there's various parts of that form which appear to have been left blank by you, are you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> Yes, I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Why was that left in that fashion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> The forms were delivered to me three days after they had arrived in prison and we were told that we should return them urgently.  Because I do not know English, I required somebody to assist me and we just filled in those details that we thought were important.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> And the evidence that you've given in court today, do you regard that as important?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> Yes, that is what is important.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> And if you had the opportunity, would you have actually completed your form with the information that you've given today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> Yes, I would have.  I would have even asked for the assistance of somebody who could help me, because there's always a fear that if you ask another inmate who understands the language, they may fill the form incorrectly deliberately so you will remain in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SEWPAL</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Sewpal.  Mr Mapoma, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Chairperson, just bear with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> When you hit the deceased with a pipe, was he still in a standing position, or was he lying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> He was lying on top of my comrade and that is when I hit him twice on the head.  He was pressing the other accused down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And where was Mandla?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> He was turning the corner that he could see me as I was assaulting the person, because as I mentioned, we were standing at different doors which were not very close, so Mandla was just turning around to approach where we were.  After I had assaulted him on the head, Mandla then arrived and stabbed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> When Eric was giving evidence you were here, isn't it so?  You were inside this room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> Eric?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes.  Eric Tshabalala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And you heard his evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> I did not hear all of it, but yes, I did hear bits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> He said when you, at the stage you drank liquor, the body had already been mutilated and put into the boiler already.  What do you say to that?  Do you agree or disagree with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> Yes, he was dead already but we had already cut out his body parts, but it was only after we had drunk alcohol that we took the body to the boiler room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> His evidence was that you hit him, stabbed him, then body mutilated and put into the boiler and thereafter you searched for weapons.  Do you agree with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> I would not say I agree because most of what I did happened after I had drunk.  Before that we killed him, removed the liver which we threw to the dog and the dog moved away from the vehicle.  Then Eric searched the vehicle.  We went to the house and we searched inside the house quickly and didn't find firearms, but just ammunition and a bottle of liquor which was next to the fridge.  We drank that alcohol and we left the house and we did not finish that bottle at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Mr Mutshiako, this is very simple.  I'm saying to you the evidence of Eric Tshabalala is that when you drank liquor, at the stage you drank liquor, the body was already disposed of or put into the boiler, what do you say to that?  Is it correct, or not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> After we had put the body into the boiler room, we went back to finish off that bottle of liquor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Okay, is your evidence now to the effect that because of the drunkenness you might have mutilated other parts of the body of the deceased person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> Well, the police said there were other body parts that were found, so I cannot dispute that because I was already drunk by that time so it is not easy for me to deny that I did do such an act because after drinking, you do not know what you do.  Even drinking that alcohol was just to get some courage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So you know at what stage the police arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> They arrived at about 6 in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And you saw what they did when they arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> We were in the vehicle at the time and they pointed their firearms at us, so we froze there.  It was myself and Mandla at the time.  By that time I was wearing some overall because my clothes were bloodied so I had tried to wash them with water.  Mr Tshabalala was inside the house at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> What were you doing in the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> There was a hole behind the seat so Mandla was retrieving ammunition from that hole and after that he also discovered a bag inside that hole that was full of ammunition.  The police confiscated all of that and some vehicle parts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So you recall, you have got a good recollection of what was happening at the stage when the police arrived but at the same time you have no recollection of what was happening when the body was being mutilated because you claim to have been drunk at that stage.  How do you explain this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> There is a lot that I do not recall.  What I recall is the removing of the liver and the scrotum.  Other things I cannot remember because I was already drunk because it was spirits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Mr Mutshiako.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Mapoma.  When you arrived on the farm the first time, was there still light?   Was it during the day, in other words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> It was at dawn, about 4.00 a.m.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are there any other questions from the Panel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> I've got no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry, just one thing.  What kind of liquor was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> It was colourless and it was a bottle as the applicant indicated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Do you remember if any one of you suggested that there should be a mutilation of the body?  How did it happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> It is not easy to recall who came up with that opinion, because he was already injured, his intestines and liver were already exposed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please, can you switch that cell phone off, or if you want to switch it on, just don't come back in here.  Sorry, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> We then decided that we should remove the liver because we could not otherwise remove the dog from the vehicle.  At that time we were still sober.  We did this and we threw it to the dog and that dog moved away.  We also cut out the scrotum and the penis.  This was to ensure that if the dog returned we would throw that to it as well, so that we could go to the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry, just explain this.  The dog moved away to where?  Where did it go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> I think it moved further away to a distance where the arrow is.  The vehicle was about where I'm seated and it moved from there to that red arrow on the wall, that was when we were able to move closer to the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How many dogs did he have there?  Was it a dog or dogs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> Just one dog.  It was a big dog.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> It was barking at you, wasn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> It just made a noise, it's just like the applicant is demonstrating, but it didn't bark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was this dog tied up?  Your fellow perpetrators say that the dog was tied up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR MUTSHIAKO:</span> Yes, there was a rope and it used that same rope to run down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Mr Sewpal, any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> No re-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SEWPAL</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mutshiako, you're excused, thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sewpal, is that the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> That is the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I have no further evidence to tender Chairperson.  I think Chairperson at this stage I must point out that our investigations have unfortunately drawn a complete blank in tracing the next of kin or relatives of the deceased person, that is Arthur Duncan Johnston who was killed there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Mapoma, we have noted that.  Mr Sewpal have you got any submissions on the merits of the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL IN ARGUMENT:</span> I have to concede that this was a gruesome and horrible killing of a human being, but I submit that all of that was taken into account in the High Court as well as in the Appeal Court, when Goldstone J, confirmed the death sentence in this matter.  However, without trying to get away from the gruesomeness of the offence, one has to take into account the fact that the applicant and his witnesses stated throughout the hearing, they in fact believed that the deceased in this matter was supplying arms to members of the IFP, that there were problems with the IFP at the time and that the second witness actually lost his mother as a result of the violence of the IFP and I submit that there is nothing basically to contradict what</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a>they say in that regard, that this offence was basically politically motivated, arising from those issues.  I know that there could be other criticisms directed at them with regard to detail of exactly what happened and so on, but I would ask you to take into account that this offence actually took place 9 years ago and one would expect to find that sort of discrepancy.  In those circumstances, I would submit, or my instructions are to submit that the application should in fact be granted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Sewpal.  Mr Mapoma, have you got any submissions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA IN ARGUMENT:</span> Chairperson apart from the fact that the act itself is so gruesome, there doesn't seem to be any political objective which was intended by killing the deceased person in this matter.  The applicants throughout are saying that their political objective by launching that attack, by going to raid, was to get weapons and in that process they went out of their way to kill the deceased person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a>	Chairperson it is quite inconceivable that three young men, armed with knives, could be overpowered by an 64 year old man, one 64 year old man, to the extent that he had to be killed.  Interestingly, not only was he killed, his body parts were mutilated.  The evidence as it is, the explanation that has been given by the applicants as to why the body was mutilated, is not satisfactory, Chairperson, that is my submission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> I thought one or two of them says at some stage there was a struggle between the deceased and one of them and they saw some intestines and they were not sure whose intestines those were and I thought the witness concerned went on to say he thought this was the intestines of his colleague and they attacked the deceased, they started stabbing the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Even on that version, Chairperson, there is some inconsistency because the applicant's version was such that the deceased was hit with a pipe and fell down and when he was down, then he was stabbed.  That is the version of the applicant and the applicant is the most crucial witness at this hearing because he's the man who applies for amnesty, he's the person who bears a responsibility to convince the Committee that he's making as a complete a disclosure and candidly as possible, so I submit Chair, that the testimony of the applicant bears much more weight than that of the other persons who have testified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> We cannot ignore evidence that has been led, be it an applicant, a co-applicant or just a witness in support of the application of the applicant, but maybe that's beside the point.  Did they have an order to do this?  Isn't that required in terms of the Act?  What is an act associated with a political objective in terms of the Act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, before I deal with that Chair, I just want to respond to the point which is beside the point.  I do not submit that the evidence of others ought not to be taken into account, but all I'm saying is that there are serious contradictions from the applicant's case as to the reason why this man was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a>	Now coming to the political objective, we now know that none of the applicants was ever involved in the conflict that was taking place between the IFP and the ANC there and for that matter, none of them was a member of the ANC.  They may have been supporters, the point is that the policies of the ANC were not followed and the action as it is had nothing to do with the policies of the ANC, it just was not an action which was intended to further the aims of the struggle waged by the ANC, in whatever manner as it is and on that basis and that basis Chairperson only, the application should be dismissed.  There are some other issues as well which I may take up, but I can only do so if the Committee may require me to at this stage Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you Mr Mapoma.  Mr Sewpal have you got any further submissions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL IN REPLY:</span> Perhaps I should just add one more factor that should perhaps be taken into account and that is that, I think it was the second witness who made the point that not only were they trying to get these arms in order to arm themselves to attack members of the IFP.  The simple removal of those arms from the deceased could have meant that Inkatha's</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a>supply could have been cut off and I think that could also have been taken into account in regards to a political motive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Yes, but was it not the evidence here that the deceased was believed to be supplying the IFP with arms for quite a long time and no action had been taken against him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> No action had been taken until this incident.  Of course there is no real explanation for why it took so long for them to act because the second witness' mother died sometime in 1988, that was conceded, so I concede that there was a long period of time between those two things happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> If it is true that the deceased was in fact supplying arms to the IFP, then this must have been a very serious problem, not so?  He must have been causing a lot of problems for the ANC people in that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> I submit that that would have been so, but I think the way in which this case has been pitched, neither the applicant nor the witnesses that he called were any high profile people in the ANC, they were simply ANC sympathisers and perhaps they would have thought that more important people would take action in this sort of matter.  I can only speculate on that but if one has to try to find some justification for why it took so long.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> ...not to have expected them to at least have consulted with the ANC, if it was their purpose to cut off arms being supplied to the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> I have to concede that is perhaps a weakness in my case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but you're submitting that that is just another factor, your case is pitched on the basis that they went to acquire arms and it's a secondary consideration, that's not the thrust of your case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> No, it isn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> My understanding of the evidence is that they did not belong to any formal political structure, did they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> There was no evidence to that effect.  I concede that.  They pitched their case on the basis that they were sympathisers of the ANC.  They didn't say that they were members as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Would one be able to say, I mean looking at the requirements of the Act, would one be able to say they were carrying out a political order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> There was no order given by anybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> One of them says, Mr Mutshiako he says there were no order but just our own initiatives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> Sorry, you referred to me page 13 of the bundle.  Yes, this was a decision that seemed to have been taken by them jointly, without any other person being involved in it, that I have to concede.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> My understanding of the Act here is that it is envisaged that the person applying for amnesty must have been carrying out orders from his organisation and not someone who is just on a frolic of his own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEWPAL:</span> I can't pitch this case at any higher level than it has been brought actually, I am limited by the evidence that we have, so I can't really take the matter much further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Mr Sewpal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a>	Yes, that concludes the formal hearing of this application.  The Panel will consider the matter and will formulate a decision in this matter as soon as we can, given the other demands that we have to contend with.  Once the decision is available we will endeavour to ensure that all of the interested parties are apprised of the decision in the matter.  Under those circumstances the decision will be reserved and we want to express our ...</p>
