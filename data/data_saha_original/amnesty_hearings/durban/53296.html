<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Right, which is the next matter?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is he in custody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Yes, he's in custody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct).  We'll take time to consider our decision in that last matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Chairperson ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We now come to the application of Mr Elias Kesla Mtolo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Chairperson, before we proceed with Mr Mtolo, I would like to find out from the Logistics Officer if the victim in this matter has arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> If the victim in this matter has arrived at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I take it if they have arrived you will want to talk to them to find out what their instructions, so we will adjourn for a few minutes to enable you to ascertain what the position is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are we now going to deal with the Khwela matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What's happening to Khwela?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> Khwela is the one we are going to be - ...(indistinct) making an announcement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We're going to adjourn, isn't it?  I was told we would adjourn it now so the victims and others can leave and go home and not have to sit and wait.  Unfortunately, those of you who have been sitting patiently throughout the day, we have three matters set down and we were unable to start as early as we'd hoped to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>	We will not be able to deal with all three matters today and it has been decided that it would be most convenient to adjourn the Khwela application to a later date and then to proceed with the Mtolo matter.  We have been asked to adjourn the Khwela matter to the week between the 17th to the 21st of May.  The matter will be heard in all probability in Pietermaritzburg, but the victims, interested parties and others will receive notification of the precise date of hearing and of where the matter will be heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>	I'm sorry for all of you who have come here today in the hope of hearing the matter finally disposed of, and have to come again.  We trust it will not happen again.  If you wish to leave now you may do so.  I gather that arrangements will be made to provide transportation for you to go.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Is it correct that you are at this stage at Nkome Prison, where you are serving a sentence of 8 years for robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Can you please in your own words tell the Commission what happened regarding the taxi that you were convicted of.</p>

<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> My uncle.</p>

<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> The situation was very bad at that time, because an IFP member was by that time not even able to go to town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, you say</p>

<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> They would be stopped by ANC members, or ANC supporters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Yes, and what would have happened if they were stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> The only thing that happened was that they were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> During that time were any IFP members killed that you know of?</p>

<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> What was your position in the community at that stage?  What sort of job did you do, and did you have a specific office, were you an office-bearer of the IFP or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> When this situation started, I was working for the Chief at Ndaleni.  That is when the ANC was formed in the area.</p>

<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Were you an Induna jeSiswe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> I would not say so, I would say I was an Induna in charge of the IFP youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Can you please now explain to the Commission what happened on the 12th of September 1992, when the taxi was stopped?</p>

<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Before we proceed, who was together with you on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> I was with four boys as well as a certain Mr Phoswa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Can you remember the names, can you give the Commission the names of the people that were with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Proceed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just repeat those names for me please, I didn't catch all of them. - just slowly.  You said Betjana Phoswa ...?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Betjana Phoswa, Khumbulani Sithole, Mpumuza Dlamini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And the fourth one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> I was the fourth one, Elias Kesla Mtolo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Were you in a vehicle or were you on foot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> We were travelling in a vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> What happened then?  You were now travelling in a vehicle and you saw a kombi that you knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> The taxi was ferrying passengers and I recognised it as the same taxi which had carried people who had attacked my home.  I was driving the car.  I then turned and followed that taxi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Just explain to the Committee, you say that you saw this taxi and you recognised it as a taxi involved in an attack on you.  Can you just explain that attack, what happened and how did you identify this taxi, how did you know that it was that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I will just repeat it.  Just quickly explain to the Commission, you say that you identified this taxi as a taxi being used in an attack on you.  When did this attack take place and where was it and what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> I know that taxi as well as the person who drives it.  I was at home and the taxi came and some people alighted from the taxi.  They were carrying guns.  They approached my home and when they arrived I was already waiting for them because I also had a firearm of my own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Yes, and what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> I told my wife and the children to lock themselves inside the house.  I stood at the gate and just hid behind the gate and when they were close to me I then emerged from where I was hiding and started shooting, firing at them.  One person was shot and the rest fled into the fields.  The one person was killed and one other was injured in that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> And how long prior to now stopping this taxi on the 12th of September 1992, did this attack take place on your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> About less than two months, I would say a month and a few weeks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Okay, now you can proceed.  So you stopped this taxi because it was a taxi that you saw ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> I followed the taxi.  I followed it until it went out of town and then it stopped at a certain place called Mandeza and because there were sugar cane fields around I accelerated and came to stop beside the taxi and the driver turned and when he saw my face the driver and the conductor fled from the taxi, they ran away, they left the taxi as it was.  I chased after the driver.  He went into the sugar cane fields.  I was trying to shoot at him at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Who was the driver, this person that you were now chasing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Mathambo Sithole.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Repeat that again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Mathambo Sithole.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Why did you chase him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> He is the person who had been carrying the people who had attacked my home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Did you see him on the day when your home was attacked?  How did you know that he was involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Yes, I saw him because the taxi stopped and those people alighted and then it went past, went further on, drove past.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> So you were chasing Mr Sithole ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> He fled into the sugar cane field and I chased him for about 10 kilometres.  I then returned to the vehicle and on seeing the taxi - the passengers had now alighted.  When I approached the taxi, when I was coming from chasing Mr Sithole, I saw the passengers standing on the road and the taxi drove off, somebody drove off with the taxi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Do you know who drove off with the taxi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> It was Khumbulani Sithole.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> What happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> I followed them into the township and I enquired from one of the boys who had been with me and he told me that Khumbulani had taken the taxi and they did not know where he had gone to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> And then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> He came back later that afternoon and he told me that they driven the taxi away and they had burnt it somewhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Did you see where the taxi was burnt or where it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> I only saw it when the police took me to the spot where it was burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Did you give any instructions that the taxi must be burnt or that something must happen to the taxi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> No, I actually reprimanded them for taking the taxi, we were only supposed to kill those people who had come to burn my house.  I did not approve of them taking the taxi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Can I just go back to where the taxi was stopped and you chased Mr Sithole.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> While you were chasing Mr Sithole, were you doing anything to try and stop him from running away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> My intention was not to stop him, I wanted to shoot and kill him because he fled into the sugar cane fields and I could not catch up with him, therefore I went back to that spot where I had left the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> How many shots did you fire at him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> I think I fired the gun three times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> What firearm did you use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> A G3 rifle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Where did you get this rifle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> When the violence erupted in Richmond, I was taken for training at Matikulu.  We actually went to Ulundi first and thereafter we went to the Matikulu training camp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Is that where you got the firearm, or where did you get the firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Yes, I obtained the firearm from Matikulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who gave you the training in Matikulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> A Xhosa man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you say a Xhosa man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> That's what the applicant said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You don't remember his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> No, I do not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Who was in charge of that camp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> I think it was the same Captain who trained us.  He - yes, I think he was the one who was in charge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Captain of what was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> I am not able to explain, but he was our commander during our training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was he a policeman, was he in the army?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> I think he was in the KwaZulu Police Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And where did the guns come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> We received them at our training camp.</p>

<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Yes, the group that I was with, the group from Ndaleni, we all received firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> How big was the group?  How big was the group you came with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> There were five of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Just to clarify one aspect, Mr Mtolo, you said you chased Mr Sithole into the sugar cane fields, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> How long did you chase him there, how long did it take?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> It was a bit of a distance.  I would not be able to estimate the distance inside this hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You earlier said it was for 10 kilometres, did you know ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Yes, I was just making an estimation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Do you know how long is a kilometre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> It not easy for me to estimate, I think from where I'm sitting to the corner up there, maybe a kilometre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Do you know how big a ball ground is, a soccer ground?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> No, I do not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can you picture a soccer ground in your mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> That was about the distance that I chased him, from one end to the other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> That's 100 metres, plus-minus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> So you could not stop him and you were not successful in striking him while you were shooting at him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Yes, I could also not shoot properly because these boys were also running in front of me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Can you explain to the Committee what your political objective was, your political motive, in this instance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> When I was first drawn into politics it was because the Chief had been attacked and I was therefore wanting to protect the Chief, but prior to that I had not been affiliated, or I had not been involved in politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Yes, but this specific attack where you chased Mr Sithole, what were you trying to ...(indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> It was actually revenge because I had been attacked many times at my home.  The reason why I attacked is because I had seen him ferrying those attackers because they managed to burn my house after my gun had jammed and I had to flee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> On that point, in what way did you suffer because of this conflict?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> I suffered greatly because I was not even prepared to come before this Committee, but I decided to come because of my family and because I wanted to obey the TRC.  My business, my home, those were all burnt.  When I am released from prison I do not even know where I'm going to stay because I do not have a home anymore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Was any of your family killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Yes, three people were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Who were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> A certain boy by the name of Spapagu and a girl called Thembile and my father.  ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can I disturb you for a moment, and just confirm the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, just before you do - what did he say about his father?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> He said his father died during faction fighting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> That's what I thought he said, I just didn't hear it translation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry just before, if I may - the faction fighting, was that political faction fighting or ...?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> It was not political, it was only the other two people who had been, who had been killed during the political conflict.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you, Chairperson, I just wanted to clarify that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see in you first application for amnesty you talk about, in paragraph 10(a), you say you were</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>"Retaliating to the atrocities committed to your family.  There was no positive goal-directed behaviour as far as my activity was concerned."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>This is to the political objective.  You then in your second amnesty application said that you did all this with the aims of politics because they burnt your house, your garage, your car:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>" ... and my boy or son"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> My home, my cars and my garage were burnt and this boy and girl were killed because we were supporters and members of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your garage you ran as a business I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then you talk - and you refer to yourself, explaining about the war, you said you were the fore-head of Chief Patrick Majozi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you also in the same application say it was to prevent - the political objective behind this attack, was to prevent attacks on yourself because seven times the members of the ANC attacked you, they even attacked your wife, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> It was not really to prevent them, because they had already burnt down my home.  I was just attacking the enemy that had attacked me at my home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you, in the affidavit made by you, signed on the 25th of November 1997 - 1998, it may be, you say that your house was attacked three days before this incident.  That is paragraph 3 on page 19.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> I was attacked more than 10 times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But were you attacked three days before this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> My house had already been burnt when this incident took place, because from the court I asked the police to escort me to go see just how badly my house had been burnt and when I got there, there were people waiting for me already and they started shooting at me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Just one further question, Mr Chairman.  Mr Mtolo, you received 8 years imprisonment for robbery, is that correct? - in the Regional Court in Maritzburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> When will you be released on parole?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> On the 5th of December this year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DE KLERK</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> No questions from me, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS MTANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just one question.  Did I understand you correctly, you did not agree with the vehicle being taken away, you were angry about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Yes, I did not agree with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And you didn't associate yourself with that at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Yes, I did not, because I even went to see the kombi only when the police took me to the spot.  I was only concerned with the person who had attacked me.  I had 8 counts of arson against me, but those were withdrawn because that was not true.  Those ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.  No further questions, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Maybe to take it further.  In other words, you are not applying for amnesty for robbery, robbing the taxi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> I can ask for amnesty because that was the reason why I was convicted.  I was even forced to admit to that robbery, something that I did not even do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Let me put the question this way, your conduct in attacking the driver of the taxi, enabled the people which were in your company to take the kombi away, do you concede to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Yes, I do concede, although it was not an order from me that they should take the taxi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> I heard you saying that you recognised the driver as the person who ferried the people to your home, what about the conductor, was he also present on that occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> The conductor was a son of the taxi owner.  At that time he did not even stay at home because he had fled as he was an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But was he present on the occasion when the house was attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> I think I saw this boy on two occasions when my house was attacked, because on one occasion I even found him with a certain group of boys from Maniba's house and they were coming to attack me at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Lastly, so you were also intending to attack him on this particular day when he ran away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Yes, I would have attacked him, I would have killed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If can just clarify something, I've got a note and I'd just like to make sure.  The owner of this vehicle was your uncle and you were on good terms with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Yes, we were on very good terms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was only the driver that you personally wanted to sort out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> Yes, well as well as ...(indistinct), because I had already noticed that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> No, questions.  That's the application, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DE KLERK</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> I have no questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you any witnesses to call?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> No, none, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Mr Chairman, I don't have any argument.  If there is any specific aspect, maybe the fact that he was convicted of robbery, he should have been convicted of attempted murder it seems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It appears, reading the judgment, that although he said he, it was shown he had the firearm and it was used to shoot, for some reason he wasn't convicted of attempted murder and the robbery and basically is that he was in charge of the gang and that's it.  But it appears to me, subject to discussion later, it could be a little bit technical where a man is serving a long sentence for robbery, to say that well legally it wasn't quite robbery so you are not entitled to amnesty, although you would have been entitled to amnesty for another offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I can argue that.  I presume that the sentence would have been much the same if it was merely attempted murder, but that's like the Chair says, it's very technical.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is your attitude on this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MS MTANGA:</span> I will leave it in your hands, Chairperson, I have no submissions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand it, subject to what I'm told, looking at the two applications, he has only asked for amnesty for robbery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> It seems that so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He has not asked for the attempted murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I presume that his application would include the facts, that means being in the situation, shooting at the person and then being convicted for robbery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well he goes further, his shooting was when he was chasing him in the sugar cane fields and it was a one-on-one situation.  As I recollect, the information in the papers was that there was some general shooting at the vehicle.  The court wasn't given quite the same picture as we have been, but we can consider that.  Thank you, we will take time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> There are a few questions that I would like to pose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> As I am about to be released from prison, what should I do because I am now homeless, let alone about my business and everything else.  What am I supposed to do now, because I am well aware of who burnt my house down.  I am not afraid of them, I only respect the law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Maybe I can assist.  It seems that the applicant is referring to reparation, it seems so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Or that he wishes to institute action.  I think he could be advised in this regard of his rights to, there may be some question of conscription if he's known about it for a long time, or reparation.  Could you perhaps assist him further in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Yes, I will do that.  Actually when I consulted with him, he did bring this up and I told him that we will follow it up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It seems from what we have heard here, that he was as much a victim of the struggle that went on between the parties as the owner of vehicle at the time and the magistrate had regard to the fact that the owner of the vehicle had lost R40 000.  We don't know how much the applicant lost in his house, his business and I gather there were some vehicles there that were also damaged.  It's a matter that I think, although technically he's not a victim, he's certainly should be considered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTOLO:</span> My house in Richmond was a double-storey and my business was very busy.  I had a kombi, two BMW's, two Colt Gallants and a bakkie, a Mazda.  Some other people's cars were also burnt in that garage.  As I'm about to be released from prison I should know what is going to happen because as I am speaking to you now, my children do not go to school because I only earn R12 a month in prison, so that my children can eat.  What should I do now because I am about to be released from prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what we have all heard should be a lesson to all of us as to how this violence that has troubled our country from time to time, the extreme damage that it does to the ordinary people of our land, people who before that were contributing towards our country and now find themselves deprived of any opportunity to do so, and I certainly hope, and I know that his attorney will take great care to put him in touch with those sources that could help establish himself again on his release, and I trust that he will be able to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>	We will now adjourn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
