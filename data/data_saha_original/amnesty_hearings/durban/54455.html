<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> With Chairperson's permission I now call to the stand Mr Dhanpal Naidoo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">DHANPAL NAIDOO:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR NAIDOO:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>	Mr Naidoo, are you also called Ricky?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You seek amnesty for the two events or incidents 17 and 18 in bundle 1, that is the attack on the Magistrate's Court, Chatsworth and the attack on Mr Rajbansi's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Were you part of the same unit as Mr Derek Naidoo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You were not.  Did you belong to any unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> Yes I was commander of a unit consisting of myself, Patrick Lerang who is now deceased and Phila Ndwandwe who subsequently was murdered by the Security Forces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes.  And who was your commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> Veejay Ramlakan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> That is Dr Ramlakan who applied for amnesty earlier today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Do you associate yourself with the motives deposed to by Dr Ramlakan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And you also subscribe to the reasons that he gave for the selection of the two targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> With regard to Mr Rajbansi, did you have any personal grudge against him, did you bear him any ill will or spite?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Did you know him personally?</p>

<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> What was your role in the Magistrate's Court incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> My role in my unit and reporting to my commander Veejay Ramlakan was in the capacity of logistics and support.  I'd agreed to meet with them at a point in Chatsworth where I delivered a parcel to him which was comprising explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> So you provided the explosive device?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> To Veejay Ramlakan, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And what was your role in the matter relating to Mr Rajbansi's residence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> Similar to the Chatsworth Court experience, I'd met Veejay Ramlakan and delivered a similar parcel to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Did you derive any financial or material benefit from these two actions or two incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> Definitely not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You were not convicted of these offences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes.  That is the evidence, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOERANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS CAMBANIS:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>	You too, did you have any contact with the applicant Raymond Lalla in relation to these events for which you apply?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS CAMBANIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> I have no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MS MOHAMED</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> What was your involvement, if any, in the bombing of the Chatsworth Magistrate's Court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I delivered a parcel to Veejay Ramlakan as I indicated earlier, that was as far as I was aware of the bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Were you aware that it was going to be used in that operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> Not at that point in time, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Did you later learn then that it was in fact used in that operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> It was much later after the processes of  Veejay</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>Ramlakan's trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> At the time you handed him both these two parcels, were you aware that he was going to use them or other cadres might use them to cause some explosion or other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> As Veejay Ramlakan indicated earlier to the Commission, it was simply an instruction to bring the parcel to him.  I didn't question my orders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, I'm not asking whether you questioned your orders, but if you're an average human being of average intelligence and someone says to you bring me a limpet mine, to me it would seem pretty obvious that that limpet mine would then be used somewhere?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> Sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And you must have foreseen that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> It would have been in the nature of our operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Precisely.  Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were these limpet mines that you delivered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> Sorry, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were they limpet mines that you delivered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, just one other thing.  Where did you get them from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> It was from the place that where I resided.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So you were in charge of ordinance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> Yes, logistics and supply.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well where did they come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> From Veejay Ramlakan.  We shared the residence together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he provide the limpet mines and you stored them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> So it would appear you acted like you were a courier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MOERANE:</span> Did you have any dealings with Mr Raymond Metheraj?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAIDOO:</span> Not directly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Not directly, I see.  I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, any dealings with who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Mr Raymond Metheraj Saclou.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>	Thank you, may the witness be excused?  Thank you.</p>
