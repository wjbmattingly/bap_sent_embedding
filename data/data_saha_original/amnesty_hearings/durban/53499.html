<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sardiwalla, are we in a position to proceed with the application of Aaron Zibuse Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> I confirm that I appear on behalf of Aaron Zibuse Zulu and that we are in a position to commence with the proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe, what is the position with regard to the victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Madam Chair, I have consulted with the victims and I've got an instruction to oppose the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Chairperson, I have prepared a supplementary affidavit for the benefit of the Committee and the hearing.  The affidavit has been signed by my client and is dated today and with the leave of the Committee, may I hand up the original signed copy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may and it will be marked as Exhibit A.  Where is your client, Mr Sardiwalla?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> My client is in the audience.  Aaron Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">AARON ZIBUSE ZULU:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sardiwalla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Mr Zulu, are you a resident of the commonly known Tugela Mountain area, where you were  resident of that area during 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And did you belong to any particular organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> What organisation did you belong to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> The ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> What was your involvement with the African National Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I was a member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Can you give us a brief description as to what the situation was at Maqonqo, commonly known as Table Mountain, during 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> In 1987 the conflict between the IFP and the ANC started.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And were you a party to this conflict?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> In what sense were you a party to the conflict?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I was involved because I was also in the fighting, fighting for my organisation the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> You are the applicant today and you've submitted in your application brief facts relating to your request for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> You also, on perusing your initial application, noticed certain errors in the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, there were several mistakes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes.  The one aspect was that you referred to the date of the incident as being the 2nd of February, was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, that was a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> In a subsequent affidavit you corrected that to be the 2nd March.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Please repeat the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> In a subsequent affidavit that was filed today in court, you corrected the date to read the 2nd March 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> You also referred to Nkosenye Majola as being one of the persons that fled after the incident, in your initial application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And you, in today's affidavit, have amended that and you advise the Committee that Nkosenye Majola was not present at the incident itself, but that Khumbu Shangase whom you omitted, was in fact present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> What was the reason for that change?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Nkosenye was present when we planned the act, but I actually made a mistake when I said he was present when the actual act was carried out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Now as a member of the ANC did you receive any formal training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I was trained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Can you elaborate what training you received?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We don't need that evidence Mr Sardiwalla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We are satisfied with what is contained in his affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I would not pursue that further.  I will now go on to the aspect relating to events leading up to the incident.  It appears that, from your affidavits, there were repeated attacks and counter attacks between the ANC and IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, that did happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And after the death of Chief Mapumulo there was a certain level of escalation in this violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Now, were you a party to the ANC when various attacks and counter attacks had taken place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> In 1993, around the date when our erstwhile Pres Nelson Mandela was released, there was a further escalation of violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Can you very briefly tell us what was the nature of the violence.  What was happening at Table Mountain, or Maqonqo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> At the time the IFP disapproved of the presence of ANC members inside the area.  There was fighting going on between members of the ANC and the IFP in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> On the 26th February there was a major incident that took place.  Can you elaborate what happened on that date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.  There was an attack and some of our colleagues in the ANC were injured, although I do not remember all of their names, I can just remember two or three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Who were these people that were injured or killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> They were killed.  It was Joseph Mlambo, Johannes Bengu and Themba Ngwenya.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Sorry, can you repeat the names please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Joseph Mlambo, Themba Ngwenya.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And Johannes Bengu, did you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> And Johannes Bengu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> After this incident, were the tensions flared as a result of this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, the tensions were very high, such that we also met and discussed that we attack the IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> You held a meeting on the 1st March, on the evening of the 1st March 1993.  What happened there?  What was discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We were discussing the fact that IFP members were able to attack us, therefore we should make a plan of how we should also attack them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And what was the plan that was discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We discussed the fact that we cannot get them at their homes, therefore it would be easier to get them along the road, maybe we should just go and block the road and get them there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes, go ahead.  What else was discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We then discussed that we would go the following morning and proceed to that spot where we would block the way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Was there any specific target discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Our intention was to look for Makeke, not everybody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Who is Makeke?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> He was one of the leaders in the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And how did you plan to get hold of him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We would get him because he used to drive a vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Was there any specific vehicle that he drove?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, we knew his vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> What was the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It was a cream-white bakkie with a white canopy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> So what was your plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We planned that as his vehicle approached, we would come out and stand quite near to it and shoot at it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And when you say we, who were the we involved in this process?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I was with Saul Mkhize, Sishe Madlala, Khumbu Shangase.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please be slow when you speak.  Please repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Sishe Madlala, Khumbu Shangase.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes, so the decision was that you were to attack the vehicle on that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> How did you proceed to execute this plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying - I thought the evidence was that it was the following morning they were to attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you Chairperson, yes, may I just correct that evidence?  This incident took place - you proceeded to execute this plan the following morning, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Just before we get on to the incident itself, about how many people were present at that gathering that made this decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> There were 20 people present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And did the gathering then decide on who was to execute this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, after the meeting we volunteered that we were going to go and carry out the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I, on a point of clarity, just take that up?  After you had decided to attack this van, did the meeting not discuss who was going to participate in the actual attacking of the van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, the meeting did not participate in that because no-one wanted to nominate anybody else, it was just us who decided on the side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you met on the side after this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So the only decision that was taken by the meeting was that this van must be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But the meeting did not decide as to who was going to launch the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, the meeting did not make the decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did you volunteer in the meeting while the meeting was still in progress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We went aside after the meeting and decided that we were the ones who were going to carry out the mission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who had convened this meeting, the meeting of the 1st March?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I will say the person who might have been in charge was Nkosenye.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what position did you hold within your local branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I did not have a position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In what capacity did he convene this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> He convened the meeting because we as a people had been harassed and attacked and whatever happened, happened to us collectively.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just get clarity here?  Did he call the meeting or did you happen as supporters of the ANC to be together?  Was this a formal meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It happened as we were sitting around as ANC members, that we discussed this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> There was no meeting called, he didn't send out people to call you to a meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, no-one called us because at that time we were residing at the mountains.  We were already staying in the mountains.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You were together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, we were together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed, Mr Sardiwalla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.  So this meeting, was it not just a group of people that decided they must take some action, or was it an organisation ANC meeting?  What was it?  Just to clarify that aspect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It was ANC members who made the decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And was this the way in which you normally made these decisions, or was it any different to the normal procedure of your meetings, ANC meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, that was a normal procedure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Now, was there any particular reason why you were not openly - why there wasn't a nomination as such openly at an open meeting to say you and you would be executing this decision?  Why did it have to be done shortly after, where people volunteered?  Was this the procedure, or can you explain why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> The reason we decided after the meeting on our own was that there were people who would sometimes come to listen to what was said in the meetings, whereas they were not members of the organisation so that if that happened that there were people who had been listening to the discussions in the meeting, they would not be able to go back and inform the authorities that Saul and the other persons were going to be carrying out this mission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let me get clarity on this.  Are you suggesting to us that you as people who had left your homes, you had fled because of the height in violence and you were staying at the mountains.  You did not trust one another.  Staying at those mountains you still thought there would be an infiltration of IFP members in your midst?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yet you still proceeded to take decisions with regard to which target of the IFP you planned to attack, without fear of the fact that that decision would filter into the ears of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, although we did mention who was to be attacked, we did not regard it as wrong to make that decision because no-one at that point was mandated to carry out the act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But wouldn't you have been scared that the very decision that you had taken would then be disclosed to the IFP and the whole objective of taking a decision would be defeated because, by the time you go there, you are most likely to be having the IFP waiting for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It was not easy for them to get that information because at that time it was already in the evening and no-one would have taken the information back to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Proceed, Mr Sardiwalla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>This white bakkie that you had intended targeting, did you know enough about this bakkie and the fact that the person you were targeting would be in this bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, we knew, we had received information that that was the vehicle he drove.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From whom had you received such information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> A certain female had actually told us that Makeke used to drive that van.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now is that how you knew that Makeke drove the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that was your only source, from this lady?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sardiwalla, you may proceed, bearing in mind obviously that you must have recourse to the evidence that is before us by way of an affidavit with regard to this particular issue, that's paragraph 6.12.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> In your affidavit you made specific reference to this vehicle being used in previous ambushes.  Can you explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.  That did happen.  We did see the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Where did you see it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We saw it approaching whilst we were sitting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> No, I'm talking about the vehicle that you said you regularly saw being used during the time of previous ambushes against you or against your organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's not correct.  The vehicle had been identified during the attack of the 26th of February and not any other attack.  That's very specific.  There was only one attack in which this vehicle was identified and that's the attack of the 26th of February.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> My apologies Chairperson.  Yes, I think you are quite correct.  I'm looking at the incorrect statement, sorry, my apologies Chairperson.  Yes, to get back to your paragraph 6.12.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does he have a copy of this affidavit you are referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> ...(indistinct - mike not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can he read English?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> ...(indistinct - mike not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, it could also expedite our proceedings if maybe you can lead him obviously having regard to the evidence already accepted by this Committee by way of an affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Zulu, your attorney is reading on page 4.  At the moment he is reading from paragraph 6.12.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you read English?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And do you understand it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Although not fully but I can pick up here and there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you do not understand what is written there, because it is not your first language, there are interpreters who are available to help you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, they can help me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Sardiwalla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  If you look at paragraph 6.12 on page 4,</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I can see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> You - can you comment on that particular paragraph where you say you identified the white bakkie transporting members of the IFP during the attack on the 26th February 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> So was that or was that not one of the prime reasons why you decided to target this bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Were you present at the attack on the 26th February?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did you yourself see this bakkie or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I did see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you know who this bakkie belonged to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why did you tell us that a certain woman, a certain female told you that Makeke drove that van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, she was confirming that knowledge we had Although we were aware that he used that van, it was her who confirmed that information that yes indeed he used the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who was this female?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Tula Cele Gcabashe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Proceed, Mr Sardiwalla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you.  On the morning of the 2nd March you proceeded to execute your decision.  Can you explain where you went and what you did?  I am referring you specifically, if you look at your affidavit, to page 5 paragraph 16.15, 6.15 sorry, and 6.16, 17 and 18.  Can you look at them and explain those aspects in your affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you proceed, Mr Sardiwalla, just to expedite these proceedings so that we don't have to come back as a Committee to ask questions of clarity, you might as well try and interject, which is quite an uncomfortable position for you but maybe it will also afford you an opportunity to try and do whatever damage might be done by your client whilst he's still giving his evidence in chief.  Your paragraph 6.14 speaks of Saul Mkhize, Khumbu Shangase, Sishe Madlala and the applicant as having been deployed to ambush the vehicle at the meeting of the 1st of March 1993.  My concern, I hope you will appreciate, is the fact that the evidence that we have thus far, is that nobody deployed them to ambush the vehicle, that they themselves volunteered to do this aside.  Now we have no evidence whether this was taken back to the meeting and the meeting then confirmed that since you have volunteered you may proceed.  How, in what context is this word deployed used having regard to the viva voce evidence of Mr Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Chairperson, may I just explain what I understood and what I believe my client understands as being this paragraph.  He has given evidence as to why this particular method was being used in taking decisions and in the normal sense, yes, I would agree that deploying is an instruction by a group or a person saying "go and do this, you, you and you go and ensure that this task is done", but because of the nature of events that my client has explained at the time, the method by which people deployed themselves to conduct a particular deed or act in the pursuance of a decision, was as he has described.  It was not done - effectively they were deployed or they were deploying themselves via this process that was the common method by which it was done.  So it was a form of deploying but not in the sense that one would normally use it given the circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So this in fact was an unfortunate choice of a word on your part.  You drew the affidavit based on his instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes, I may concede that maybe it wasn't quite intended to be deployed, although in the general context of the evidence, it was an accepted aspect that he had been deployed, but yes, I agree, in the light of what he has said today it may be is the wrong choice of word.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> After you volunteered, who planned the attack the next morning?   Was the attack planned only between the four of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, we planned the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did you decide where the attack should take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We decided that we were going to block the road, or the route that they used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did they use that road every day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did anybody watch him, survey him for a few days to see what he's doing and who's accompanying him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, no-one did that but we knew that that was the road they used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We need to take a two minute adjournment at the request of somebody who has chosen to remain unknown at this stage.</p>

<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sardiwalla you may proceed, the ball is still in your court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR SARDIWALLA:</span> (cont)</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>	Thank you Chairperson.  The morning of the 2nd of March 1998 you proceeded to execute your decision.  Now can you briefly confirm the steps you took as described in paragraphs 6 - 15, 16, 17 and 18 of the affidavit at page 5?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> On the 2nd of March we went out to dig out the weapons we had concealed.  There were two Ak47's, V11 and a 303 firearm.  We thereafter left.  There was a steep hill where we hid behind some trees.  That is where we waited until the vehicle approached and when it approached we went out onto the road and we started firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Please continue.  Tell us about the firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> There were four of us and we fired simultaneously and we were standing just next to the road where the vehicle was approaching, that is in front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Now as far as the road is concerned, can you just describe the road?  Did you see this vehicle approaching from a distance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We saw it approaching from a distance and we prepared ourselves so that as it came closer to us we would come out from where we were hiding and start firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Are you saying that it was just after a bend that you opened fire, when the vehicle emerged on an incline, at a bend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Did you ever have the opportunity of checking who was in the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, we could not ascertain who was in the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you give us an estimation of how far were you from the point at which this car was, that is the bend in the road?  How far were you?  You were hiding in some trees.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I think it could have been 10, 15 or 20 metres, although I'm not sure whether I'm accurate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And did you step out into the road and block the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We stepped out and stood on the edge of the road and started firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Now, when you fired were you facing the vehicle head on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Saul was facing the vehicle although he was not in the centre of the road, but he was standing on the road and we were all facing the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was that, I didn't get.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Saul.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And where were you standing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I was standing on the side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> When you commenced firing, you say the vehicle was about 10, 15 or 20 metres.  Can you give some indication in this ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 10 or 15 metres, not 20 metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> My apologies, 10 or 15 metres.  Can you give some approximation of the distance here, from where you are sitting, as to where the vehicle was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I can.  From where I am seated it could be up to the lady out there.  I would say up to that distance where the lady is standing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Would one estimate that as being approximately, Chairperson, about 50 metres, 40, 50 metres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, ...(indistinct - mike not on about 10 to 15.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> 15 metres, from there?  20 at the most, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>Okay.  Did you have a specific view of who was in the vehicle?  You say you did not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, we did not see who was inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just get back to this distance from the vehicle.  Were you that distance from the vehicle when you were shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I have mentioned before that I may not be accurate in measuring it in metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, we're not talking metres.  You pointed the distance here, which we agreed, I think we're satisfied is at the most 20 metres.  My question is this, I understood you to be saying Saul was in the road in front of the vehicle and you were on the side.  Did you shoot at the front of the vehicle or were you next to the vehicle on the side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We fired towards the front and some fired at the side of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now this is exactly the question, were you firing at the side of the vehicle or at the front?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I fired towards the side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now if you were firing to the side, how broad was this road that you could be 20 metres away, firing at the side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> The road was wide, as well as the fact that at that time the car was turning around a bend, so that at that time the side of the vehicle was facing towards us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That I really don't understand.  Is this bend, can you point the bend for us?  A bend is not a turn to the right or to the left, in terms of a 90 degree turn.  What kind of a bend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It was a bend where the car was going to turn left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was it a single road or was there a connecting road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It was one single road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I don't know how to get the information as to the nature of this bend.  We don't have a map or anything that could indicate that.  Could you explain to us the width of the road in distance?  Was it as wide as from where you are sitting to where I am, or to where your counsel was, or to the back of the hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> The width would be from where I am seated to the person with the camera out there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That's about 8 paces.  Now, and you were standing on the side of the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I was on the side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now can you again explain to us, if that was the width of the road, how could you have been as far as you earlier pointed to us, the lady standing, which we agreed was at most say 20 metres away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Please repeat that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you explain to us how could you have been 20 metres away from the car, if you were standing on the side of the road shooting at the side of the vehicle, when the road was only from where you are sitting to the person with the camera?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I was standing on the side, waiting for the car to approach because it was coming from below and going up that steep hill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did the car stop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It stopped after we had fired at it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How far were you from the car when it stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Although I cannot estimate the distance, but maybe I could point it out here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Please do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> When the vehicle stopped I would say maybe I would be where I am seated and the vehicle would be there where my attorney is sitting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That's two times the width of the road.  About 16 paces, or a little less.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think about 10 to 12 paces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And when it stopped, did the driver jump out and run away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I could not see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But weren't you shooting at the driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, we were directing our shots towards the driver, but when he stepped out of the vehicle we did not see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it your evidence today that you saw no-one leaving the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, no-one saw the driver stepping out of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm not talking about the driver, you saw no-one leaving the vehicle during your attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, we did not see anyone because after firing those shots we ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In your affidavit you say the shooting lasted for a minute or two and during that time nobody escaped from the vehicle.  I am waiting for an answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> At that time we did not see anyone stepping out of the vehicle because we were preparing to flee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you couldn't see how many people were inside the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, we did not see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you have sight at least of the driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you started firing at the car, that car had reached the top of an incline, is it not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, it was just at the start of the incline.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it had not reached the top of the incline?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, it had not reached the top, it was just at the start of that incline.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So the bend is before you reach the top of the incline?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you. You may proceed, Mr Sardiwalla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  So you fired.  The firing lasted for a minute or two and you say you fled thereafter. Where did you flee to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We fled to where we used to reside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> So did you not wait for any particular response to see what the effects of your shooting were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, we did not wait.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you not go to the car to see how many people had fallen victims of what you had intended to do?  Your stated objective was to kill a certain Mr Makeke.  Did you not have an interest in finding out if that driver was indeed Makeke and if that Makeke had died, because the stated objective of this attack was to kill Makeke?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It was not easy to go check at the vehicle because we believed that they were also armed and they could easily fire at us, that is why we just fired and then fled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you ever told that Makeke moved in the company of people who were armed at all times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, we knew that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where did you get that information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We used to see him passing in the company of those people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you actually knew Makeke quite well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I knew him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just find out - Makeke, what was his full name?  Is it Mkhize?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I just know him as Makeke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You're aware that in the trial of your brothers, that evidence was introduced there that a certain Mkhize was the target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I have no knowledge thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I can just refer you to page 5 of the Judgment which is in the bundle, that in a statement by your brother the accused number 1, which was the subject of a trial within a trial, that he told that he was instructed by his uncle, accused number 2, to join him in an intended attack upon a certain Mkhize and he named in that statement, Mkawe, Toto, Saul and Sishe as the co-conspirators.  You also names Saul and Sishe and I think Toto.  You did not mention Toto?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>Saul and Sishe.  But you don't know who this Mkhize was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Which Mkhize?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it ever your intention to kill a person by the name of Mkhize, as opposed to Makeke?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, I did not have such intentions because that was my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know this Mkhize, who has been referred to in this Judgment?  Are you familiar with the statement which has been put to you by Mr Malan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but would you know which Mkhize your brother was referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I would not know, but there is just one Mkhize that I know and that person is my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You would be speculating, wouldn't you, because there is no first name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He said Mkhize was his brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but he doesn't know which Mkhize is referred to here.  That would be speculation on your behalf because you don't know which Mkhize was being referred to in this alleged statement made by your brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, I just want to get clarity from the interpretation.  Did you say Mkhize was your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, Mkhize is my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was one of his children also killed in the attack, or wounded in the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Do you refer to the attack that we launched?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I heard that some of his children had been injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you - was Mkhize, your brother, was he an ANC supporter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, he was an IFP supporter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you - was he with Makeke at stages?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, they did not used to travel together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was he active in IFP, your brother Mkhize?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Although he was not an active member of the IFP, he did so because there were people who pressurised him and he was afraid for his life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I, just while I'm asking questions, ask you, the place that you resided in the mountain, did your family go there with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, my family did not reside there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did your brothers reside with you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> They used to stay at a certain area, eSnatengi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, I didn't get that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> eSnatengi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were they not with you in the mountain that night when the attack was planned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did they have any knowledge of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, they did not know, they just heard about it thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who told them and when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> They heard about it on the radio that the children had been injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Sorry Chairperson, I think the answer is quite different to the question asked.  Can the member of the Committee please re-ask that question for clarity purposes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I did not get a different answer to what I was expecting, so I wasn't surprised.  Maybe you can lead me, I'm not sure what you are referring to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> I think the question put to him is where did they get to know about the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He said they heard on the radio.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> They heard on the radio.  Sorry I thought he said we heard on the radio.  Sorry I didn't get that clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who told you that they heard on the radio?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, who told you that they heard on the radio?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I heard from Tulane who used to drive a taxi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When did he tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> In the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you then inform him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, we did not inform him, he just deduced it for himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How did he manage to deduce it for himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I would say because he knew that we resided up there in the mountains to protect ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But the killing didn't take place where you resided.  The killing took place at some other venue, is it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, it happened at a different place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That's right.  Now how did he deduce for himself that you were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> He realised it because he was an ANC supporter and he knew the normal practice of how we did things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I'm not sure that I understand that but thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> That wasn't the normal thing for the ANC to kill school children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Chairperson, I must object to that question because I didn't think he said, he hasn't reach that stage where he said he specifically had the intention or went there to kill school children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> No, but he said they heard on the radio and then it was known that it was school children that's been killed and he made the deduction that his brother would know he is involved because that was what the ANC was doing and I'm only putting it to him that that was not the ANC's method of doing things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Shouldn't you still object?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because there is no evidence led before us that it was not the police of the ANC to kill children belonging to the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes, of course that is very, very clear.  If that is what the Committee Member is suggesting, then obviously I must then vigorously object to that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I'm not sure, you need to clarify it for me now.  You said, and that's in your supplementary affidavit paragraph 7 and then paragraph 8, that the following day you heard on the radio that there were children in the vehicle and that 6 of them were fatally shot and 15 injured in the ambush.  You're aware of that statement that you made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you hear that on the radio while travelling with your brother in the taxi, driving the taxi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, I was at the house by that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You heard it at the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Chairperson, sorry Chairperson, you know this approach of putting facts that haven't been led, I think really Committee Members must refrain from.  There's evidence led.  If a question is being asked, with respect Chairperson, I think the question must be asked rather than putting evidence to the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think he's ...(indistinct) he heard from Tulane that he had heard about the attack, the precise nature of which has not been canvassed on the radio and we'll give the ropes to you to canvass that.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Okay. So you heard the following day , you say on the radio, that 6 children were killed and 15 were injured in an ambush.  Firstly, where did you hear this?  Where were you when you heard this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I was in Edendale when I heard this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Who were you with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It was myself, Saul, Sishe and Khumbu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> So those of you that actually executed this particular directive were together when you heard this on the radio?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, we were together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I was distracted for a second and so I have not really taken note of your earlier question.  If you can burden the record by repeating yourself again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> I'll repeat them for the record, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>You say you heard on the following day that there were 6 children that were fatally shot and 15 injured.  Where were you when you heard this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I was in Edendale when I heard that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And who were you with when you heard this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I was with Saul, Sishe and Khumbu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And was this the first time that you heard about this or did you hear about this, the effects of your ambush, prior to the radio announcement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It was the first time that I heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And what was your reaction when you heard about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> My heart bled when I heard that innocent children had been killed, including those of my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> You say your step-brother Bernard Mkhize's children were also killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, they were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And you say you were hurt when you heard this?  Why?  Why were you hurt?  You were in an ambush and you had intention to ambush a vehicle, what affected you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I was hurt because the person that we had targeted had not been found.  It was unfortunate that children, who were not the target, were the ones who were harmed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Did you ever suspect that there were children in that vehicle, or did you see children in that vehicle, prior to your shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We did not see the children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And if you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We would have not shot at them had we seen them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Was it at any stage a directive for you to go and shoot children or Makeke?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I think the evidence was that there was no such directive in any event.  They volunteered, they decided to go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Maybe you want to speak of policy or practice.  You can rephrase your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you, Chairperson, I'll rephrase it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>Was it ever the policy of the organisation that you belonged to, the ANC, to specifically target and attack children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, it was not the policy of the ANC to kill children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I interpose, Mr Sardiwalla?  In the nature of the attacks that occurred in your area, launched by the IFP on your members, were children not attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I never came across such a child being murdered by the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And, was there never an occasion when members of your organisation attacked children of IFP members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It never happened that my members attacked children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you had a clear understanding that, when you launched attacks, you were never to direct such attacks on children of your opponents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, we knew that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Sardiwalla, you may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.  So, you had absolutely no knowledge, neither did you suspect that there would be children in that vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Did you believe that Makeke would be in that vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I had that belief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And your intention was to actually destroy Makeke?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Did you do this clearly to further the</p>

<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Sardiwalla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>Ms Thabethe, do you have any questions to pose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, Madam Chair, I do.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Zulu, when the attacking question on the 2nd of March 1993 occurred, where were you staying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I was staying at my sister's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> When I say where, which area were you staying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> At eNkanyezini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Is that part of Maqonqo, or let me ask it this way, was it part of Maqonqo or was it outside Maqonqo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It is close to Maqonqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> How close would you say this place is from Maqonqo in terms of kilometres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It was just a fence separating the two areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Would it be correct for me to say Maqonqo was a big area at kwaMapumolo wherein there were different villages within Maqonqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And one of these places was a place called Mboyi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Did your family or maybe to be more precise, did your father and your brothers stay at Mboyi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And would I be correct if I say that Mboyi was plus minus 5 kilometres from Maqonqo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I would agree with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Now, in your affidavit you have indicated that Mr Gcabashe, Chief Sabelo Gcabashe was Induna at Maqonqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Won't you refer us to the page and the exact paragraph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I will do that just now Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's page 3, paragraph 6.7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Madam Chair, I am indebted to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a>Mr Zulu you say in paragraph 6.7, it's page 3 of your affidavit, that Chief Sabelo Gcabashe was an IFP leader in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Isn't it correct that he was actually an IFP leader at Maqonqo and not at Mboyi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> That is one area, that is Mboyi and Maqonqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Why I am asking you this question, it's because my instructions are that Chief Sabelo Gcabashe was a leader at Maqonqo and at Mboyi there was another leader there.  If the Committee could bear with me, I am looking for his name here in my notes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying, Ms Thabethe, that Chief Gcabashe was a leader, an IFP leader at Maqonqo and that there was another IFP leader at Mboyi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, Madam Chair, that's the evidence I'm trying to ascertain.  Did you know about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, I only knew of Sabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Madam Chair, if you can allow me just to get the name of the leader, please. Thanks.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Did you know that Mr Bernard Mkhize was the leader at the Mboyi area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I did not know it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Would you dispute this fact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I would dispute it because that was something I did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How can you dispute something that you don't know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I dispute it because I was around there but I never heard that he was an IFP leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is this Bernard Mkhize the same person as you have referred to as your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If he was an IFP leader, as opposed to being an IFP member, you would have known as his relative, would you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I would have known.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it should be something that would be within your personal knowledge, whether he was a leader at Mboyi, or if he wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I would have known if he was a leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And he was not, to your knowledge, a leader of the IFP at Mboyi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, as far as I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you ever stay at Mboyi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did you stay at Mboyi?  Which year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> From my childhood until 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you have information as to when Mr Mkhize, Bernard Mkhize, became an IFP leader at Mboyi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Not with me Madam Chair, but I can get that information because Mr Mkhize is present today, if the Committee can allow me quickly to get that information.  Thank you Madam Chair.  My instructions from Mr Mkhize is that he was a leader as from 1990 whilst the applicant was still residing at Mboyi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a>	Mr Zulu, Mr Mkhize has actually indicated that he was a leader of the IFP at Mboyi from 1990 and you were still residing there during 1990, so do you still maintain that he was not a leader of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I still maintain that I did not know that he was an IFP leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Is it also correct that Maqonqo was an IFP area, or the people living there were IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, at that time it was inhabited by the IFP because ANC members had left the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Which area did ANC members stay in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> ANC members fled to Edendale.  They returned when they wanted to claim their houses and property and then they went to reside at eNkanyezini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> When did this happen would you say?  During which period, when the ANC members fled to Edendale?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Around 1988.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You see, I am trying to ascertain, because in your affidavit at page 4 paragraph 6.9 you state that the members of IFP attacked the kraals of the ANC members in the area and my instructions are that there were no ANC members in the area and further my instructions are that there was no area which could be called an ANC area.  So, can you explain paragraph 6.9 to me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you reading that paragraph in conjunction with paragraph 6.2 which specifically tells you which area he is talking of at Maqonqo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Can I have your question again, Madam Chair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm saying, are you reading the paragraph that you have referred him to in conjunction with paragraph 6.2?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This area seems to be Table Mountain which is within Maqonqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, Madam Chair.  I am not sure if I understand you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm saying, are you aware that what he is saying is that his area was Table Mountain in Maqonqo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Which area would he be talking about Madam Chair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Table Mountain according to his affidavit.  Maqonqo had different areas and his area was called Table Mountain.  I'm a little confused because there is reference now to Mboyi and eNkanyesini and I'm a little lost as to which area.  That's why I want to know which area you are talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Sure, Madam Chair.  Maybe before I ask that, can you clarify, Mr Zulu, when you talk about Table Mountain, exactly which area is this in Maqonqo?  Does it form part of Maqonqo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Maqonqo is part of Table Mountain, it's within Table Mountain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where exactly were you staying?  What was the name of your area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I was staying at Mboyi but that area is within Maqonqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, what area was being attacked by IFP people that you had to protect and launch retaliatory attacks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> There were ANC and IFP members in Maqonqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which area, which particular area, were you protecting which had been attacked on the 26th February by the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It was an area called eZinembini and Dabe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Called what?  Come again Ms translator.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> eZinembeni and Dabe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Won't you spell that for us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> E - Z - I - N - E - M - B - E - N - I   and  D - A - B - E</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now the IFP attacked two areas within Maqonqo on the 26th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> They attacked Dabe on the 26th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and those were the kraals that you've referred to as being those belonging to ANC members in your area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you staying at Dabe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I was at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now when you referred to "my area" as you have sought to during your viva voce and also your testimony that we have by way of an affidavit, are you referring to Dabe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> As I explained before, there were different districts within one area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but which district are you referring to or which area are you referring to, in relation to the attacks that were launched against your members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I was residing at Dabe on the 26th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Proceed, Ms Thabethe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Madam Chair.  Mr Zulu, you say in February 1993 you were residing at Dabe, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> When did you move to Dabe, to stay at eNkanyezini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I left Dabe because our houses had been burned down.  We then crossed over to eNkanyezini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> When?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> After the 26th we lived at eNkanyezini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Is Dabe part of Maqonqo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You see what I'm trying to understand, Mr Zulu, is that I asked you earlier on that isn't it correct that the whole of Maqonqo was an IFP area and you said "yes, that's correct" and I asked you that isn't it correct that there was no ANC area at Maqonqo and you agreed with me that that was so.  You even explained further that the ANC people had moved to Edendale.  Now I don't understand what you are talking about in your affidavit when you say the IFP members attacked you at Maqonqo in an ANC area when there were ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, sorry, he didn't say in an ANC area, he said ANC members in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Honourable Member of the Committee.  I will just rephrase my question then before I advance my predicament.  How were you identified as ANC members at Maqonqo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We resided together separate from the IFP people, who also resided together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> So are you saying as ANC people you were residing together in an area and that's how you were identified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> There was a misunderstanding which caused that split that ANC people went their own way and IFP people also went a different way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your evidence, Mr Zulu, is that the ANC members had in any case fled Maqonqo to Edendale as early as 1988.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, they did flee but returned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now you did not give us that evidence and that is the difficulty that Ms Thabethe has been presented with because you did not state that some returned at Maqonqo and if they did, when did they return?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Chairperson, I must just correct that.  My notes state that he did in fact say that ANC members were staying at Edendale.  They then returned and wanted to claim their houses and land.  He did say that earlier in the evidence, I've got that noted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He said houses and property, it wasn't necessarily land.  I didn't read that, because he said that then they went to stay to eNkanyezeni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So when did the majority of ANC members return to Maqonqo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Around 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Madam Chair.  I put it to you Mr Zulu, that Maqonqo was an IFP area and further, that there were no ANC people, no ANC area at Maqonqo.  Sorry, not that there were no ANC people, there were no known ANC people at Maqonqo.  What is your response to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> There were known ANC members at Maqonqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you known to be an ANC member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And it is your evidence that you have always been an ANC member?  You never belonged to the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I further put it to you, Mr Zulu, that as a result of the fact that there were no known ANC members in the area and there wasn't an ANC area at Maqonqo, the IFP never attacked the kraals of ANC members in the area, as you have stated at paragraph 6.9.  What is your response to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I would say yes, they should be saying so because the ANC had fled from the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But is it not your evidence that they returned, quite a number of them returned around 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I'm saying that is why they say so, because the ANC fled but returned, but they did not have a specific area that they called their own.  They resided in that area assuming that they were the IFP and that was their area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying they also assumed that you were an IFP member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, I would not say so.  I would say no because they would not be able - they did not see me, just like members of the ANC who were residing in the same area but they did not see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you are actually saying ANC members were not visible in Maqonqo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> They were not visible for the fact that they had fled before and on their return they had returned to ANC people who had remained in the area and those who had remained behind, the ANC who had remained behind, had done so in the pretence that they were not members of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> My question is, are you suggesting that post 1992, when a majority of ANC people came back, returned, claimed their property and houses, they were not visible as ANC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, they did not display that they were ANC members and even where we were residing, we were not staying with IFP members, we were staying on our own, and IFP members were staying separate from us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Ms Thabethe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Madam Chair.  I also put it to you Mr Zulu that you were not a known member of the ANC at Maqonqo because the area is IFP and also because your family at Mboyi was IFP, so they also took it that you are also IFP.  What is your response to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, my family belongs to the IFP but I did not join the IFP, I joined the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Zulu at paragraph 6.6 ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, may I just make sure of the answer here - are you saying your family knew that you were ANC or did they not know that you were ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> My family knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That you were ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But Mkhize knew that you were an ANC person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, he did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say your family knew, who are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> My parents as well as my siblings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were your parents ANC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> They were IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were your brothers and sisters ANC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> My sisters became ANC members and they also had to leave the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Madam Chair.  I won't take this issue any further, I'll argue it during my argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think sufficient ground has been laid for any kind of argument you may wish to present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a>Mr Zulu I was still directing you to paragraph 6.6 of your affidavit at page 3 where you say,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a>"Numerous members of my organisation and family were killed as a result of the attacks and counter attacks between our organisation and the IFP."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>My first question to you is, which members of your family are you referring to, in terms of the political organisations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I am not referring to the immediate family that you reside or stay with in one house.  There are other members of the extended family, who may be residing at another place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> So which members of your family were you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It was Geoffrey Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> And Tommy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> What's his surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> And Sepo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> And Bongane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From - which area did they reside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> At Maqonqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And when were they killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Around 1988, 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would that be prior to the fleeing of ANC members in Maqonqo to Edendale?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were they, these members of your family, were they ANC or Inkatha supporters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> They were ANC supporters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And the relation of these people, how were they family to you?  Geoffrey?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> He was a relative in the sense that they were related to my father, he may have been a brother to my father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And Tommy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> They were all related in the same way to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> These are not all brothers of your father, are they all your uncles, is that what you're telling us now?  How were they family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Their fathers were my father's brothers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So they were cousins.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Where about in Maqonqo were they staying?  In which village?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> At eZinembini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does it really matter, Ms Thabethe, because this happened prior to the departure of ANC members in Maqonqo to Edendale?  So the killing happened post 1988, I mean prior to 1988 and we already have evidence that in 1988 the ANC members left Maqonqo during the height of the political violence to Edendale.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Madam Chair, it's important in the sense that my instructions are that this was an IFP area and any ANC people maybe might have fled but they were not known in the area and what he is saying is that these people were killed inside the area during the counter attacks between IFP and ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But I thought, when I was questioning him he indicated, his evidence suggested that the killing took place prior to the departure of ANC members from Maqonqo to Edendale and that the people returned around 1990 to Maqonqo.  Maybe you should find out if any persons were killed, any members of his family were killed after the return of these ANC members from Edendale to Maqonqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Madam Chair, I don't know whether I am understanding the applicant correctly.  He is saying these people were killed in 1989, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, he later corrected himself and he said they were killed before the departure of ANC members from Maqonqo to Edendale, which happened in 1988.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Unless you want to canvass that issue so that you get clarity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, Madam Chair.  My difficulty still is that according to my instructions this was entirely an IFP area and there were no counter attacks between ANC and IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a>...(indistinct - mike not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a>...(indistinct - mike not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed then Ms Thabethe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Zulu, when did the conflict or the counter attacks, as you put it, between IFP and the ANC at Maqonqo begin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> In 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I'll have to take instructions with regard to that Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  May I just get clarity on this particular aspect of your evidence?  Is it your evidence that by 1988 the conflict at Maqonqo had reached such levels that the ANC members were forced to leave the area and stay in Edendale?  Is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that the members of your family that you've alluded to in terms of paragraph 6.6 were killed in 1988, that is prior to the departure of the ANC members from Maqonqo to Edendale?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, my family members were killed in 1988.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and that would not be 1989, because you say that happened before ANC members left Maqonqo to stay in Edendale.  We are waiting for your response, Mr Zulu.  In your earlier evidence you had indicated that members of your family were killed either in 1988 or 1989.  Do you recall saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then I questioned you whether they were killed prior to the departure of ANC members from Maqonqo to Edendale and you said yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And it is your evidence that ANC members were forced to leave the area of Maqonqo for Edendale in 1988.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, that's what I've said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now if you are saying that and you agree with that aspect of your evidence, then there is a conflict between what you are saying with what you are again saying about the time period because if these members were killed prior to the departure of ANC member from Maqonqo to Edendale, which we know to have happened in 1988, they therefore couldn't have been killed in 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you therefore agree that you have made a mistake that these members were killed in 1988, because you say they were killed prior to the departure of people from Maqonqo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I do agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Madam Chair I'll proceed to other aspects and then I'll get the instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Whilst we are on that point, Ms Thabethe, maybe this is the convenient time to adjourn for lunch and reconvene at 1.30.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> As the Committee pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">AARON ZIBUSE ZULU:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed with your cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> (cont.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a>	Madam Chair, I would like to indicate that I did receive instructions with regard to what was happening at that time from 1989, 1988 onwards but by the time I consulted, Mr Zulu the father of the applicant, was not longer at the venue, so I couldn't consult with regard to the people who were killed from the family.  But I have told somebody that I would like to consult with him with regard to that, but I would like to proceed on other aspects.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You will just give us an indication when it is an appropriate time for you to take those instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I will do that, Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a>Mr Zulu, you have indicated in your evidence that your intention when you committed the act on the 2nd of March 1993 ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I interrupt?  Is there something wrong with the machine?  Is it deliberate that the Zulu translation must come out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">SOUND TECHNICIAN:</span> ...(indistinct) there are too many people in the audience for us to furnish them all with receivers.  If it's bothering you, then I must turn it down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think we'll keep up with it, we just thought it was strange, we are not used to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Ms Thabethe, you may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Madam Chair.  Mr Zulu, in your evidence you have stated that your intention, when you committed the act on the 2nd of March 1993, was to attack Makeke.  My question to you, why did you want to attack Makeke?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We wanted to attack Makeke because he was the person who was attacking us, killing us.  He was the person who was brave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Where was he killing you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> He was killing ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Where were members of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> ANC members from Maqonqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Now my next question to you is, my instructions are that Makeke did not own a cream-white van.  He had other cars, but not a cream-white van.  What is your response to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, he didn't own a cream-white bakkie, but he was driving another cream-white bakkie, not the one that was his own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was driving, but not owning, a cream-white bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In what capacity would he drive something like a cream-white bakkie which he didn't own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> He was driving it because the owner was also an IFP member or they belonged in one organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So this was not his car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, it wasn't his car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you knew that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, we knew that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry did you - was your answer to Ms Thabethe's question that he was also driving a cream-white bakkie, another one?  You said he was driving one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Is that another cream-white bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, there was a cream-white bakkie which didn't belong to him and he owned a white bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But the way I understand your evidence is to the effect that the cream-white bakkie that you knew him to be driving, you knew that it wasn't his own bakkie, that it belonged to somebody else who worked with him.  This cream-white bakkie would be driven by him from time to time on loan from this friend of his.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> The vehicle that you shot at, who was the owner of that vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I don't know the owner because they just came to the area, or they just moved to the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You wouldn't know whether it belonged to Mr Mhlembe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, I wouldn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And wasn't this vehicle driven by Mr Tulane Zimu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Who used to drive the vehicle that you shot at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Makeke and the owner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And the owner was who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> The owner is the one that I said I don't know his name because he just moved to the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And this Mr Makeke, you don't know his full names, or more names of him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, I only know him as Makeke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can I just clear something with you?  You have just given evidence that Makeke did not own a cream-white bakkie, that that one was owned by a person that he worked with who had just moved into your area and whose name therefore you do not know but that Makeke did own a white bakkie.  Did I hear you properly when you said that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you knew him to be owning a white bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now the bakkie that attacked the members of the ANC in your area on the 26th of February, what colour was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It was a cream-white bakkie with a white canopy. CHAIRPERSON:   Why was it then associated with Makeke, when you knew quite well that Makeke owned a white bakkie and not a cream-white bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It is because we used to see Makeke driving the very same bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I'm aware that he used to drive that bakkie, but why did you associate the presence of the car on that attack of the 26th of February with Makeke, because even though he used to drive the car, it wasn't his car, it was owned by somebody else and those facts were facts which were within your personal knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We attacked because we saw him bringing people and we also heard that he was driving that car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you heard that on the day of the attack, when the cream-white bakkie was seen, it was seen being driven by Makeke?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who told you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Tula Cele Gcabashe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you did not personally see Makeke driving the car on the 26th of February?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> When they attacked I didn't see Makeke driving it, but I used to see Makeke driving it on other days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You may proceed, Ms Thabethe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a>Mr Zulu, is the car that Makeke drove, that you saw him driving, the same one you attacked on the 2nd of March?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, it is the same one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> What type of a car was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I don't remember very well whether it was a Toyota or something else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> There was a cream-white van, a Toyota Hilux which used to transport children, school children every day in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, we didn't know the fact that that car was transporting children or school children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> My instructions are that you knew very well that there was a car that transported school children every day in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> That is a very big mistake.  We didn't know that and if we knew this information, we were not going to attack children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How would he have known that Ms Thabethe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You see, Mr Zulu, in your affidavit you've indicated that you did see a vehicle which regularly gathered people, actually you say the vehicle was regularly seen in the area and the gathering whatever.  I don't understand this sentence, but I understand it to be saying that you decided that the said vehicle must be ambushed because you saw it gathering people in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The vehicle was regularly seen in the area, but he has not been specific as to who saw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Maybe I should rephrase my question.  The vehicle that was regularly seen in the area, did you see it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I saw the car because I knew it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And yet you did not see the car that used to transport school children everyday.  Is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I've never seen the one that carries children, or that it was transporting children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I just take issue with what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a>Your evidence is that Mr Makeke, who was your main target, owned a white bakkie and your viva voce evidence is to the effect that the car that was seen on the 26th of February was a cream-white bakkie and it had been seen on the scene of the ANC members attack on the 26th of February and that was why you decided to attack the cream-white bakkie.  In your affidavit however, that's on page 4, paragraph 6.12, you unequivocally state that you amongst others, you amongst others, identified a white bakkie with a canopy that was seen transporting members of the IFP during the attack of the 26th of February 1993.  Now, it wasn't a cream-white bakkie that was identified as a target for attack, it was a white bakkie.  Why did you then attack a cream-white bakkie, when you had identified a white bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> When you go on an attack usually you go by one, two or three cars and you drop those people, the attackers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't understand.  I don't know whether you understood the ambit of my question.  My question is, your affidavit, the evidence contained in your affidavit is that it was a white bakkie that was identified by the gathering for attack, yet you proceeded to attack a cream-white bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We did so because we knew that the cream-white bakkie was being driven by Makeke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But it had not been a cream-white bakkie that had been identified as an object of attack by the meeting, it was a white bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Both white and a cream-white.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where is a cream-white bakkie being alluded to in your affidavit?  Can you have recourse to paragraph 6.12 and see what you yourself have stated in your affidavit?  Now you have had an opportunity of going through your own affidavit.  Can you now give an explanation why you proceeded to attack a cream-white bakkie when you had identified a white bakkie as an object of attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> When someone is writing something there are some mistakes that can transpire there, but the reason we attacked the cream-white bakkie is because Makeke was the driver.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is still your evidence that Makeke did own a white bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, he owned a white bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Proceed, Ms Thabethe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Madam Chair.  You say Makeke was driving this cream-white bakkie.  For what purpose did he used to drive it for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I wouldn't say for what purpose.  He is the one who knew that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Maybe I should rephrase my question.  Did he used to transport people in it or would he drive the bakkie alone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Sometimes he would take the attackers to go and attack.  Sometimes he would use the car for his own personal reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And in your opinion it's the same car that you attacked on the 2nd March 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Well, my instructions, Mr Zulu, are that this cream-white bakkie you attacked on the 2nd March 1993 was driven by Pigalitetwa Ngobane and was owned by his father and further, that he used to drive school kids every day and you knew about this.  What is your response to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I didn't get the name of the person, Ms Thabethe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Pigalitetwa.  Was your answer, did you say you don't know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I would like you to repeat that question for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Ms Thabethe is saying is that the cream-white bakkie you attacked on that day, was driven by Pigalitetwa Ngobane and was owned by Pigalitetwa's father.  Do you have any comments to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I didn't know the owner at that time.  I knew the car as being driven by Makeke most of the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But has it not been your evidence that you knew that the car did not belong to Makeke, that Makeke wouldn't drive it all the time.  The owner would also drive it.  So how would you know that on this occasion that the car would be driven by Makeke?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We heard before that he was driving the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I would like you to respond to my next question that I put to you, that my instructions, and I put it to you, that you knew that this car drove everyday taking school children to school at that time when you attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I didn't know this and I don't think I would have been well if I had attacked children knowing that they were innocent and leave the people whom I knew as not being innocent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> When you shot at the cream-white bakkie, did you realise that there were people inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, we saw that there were people inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> But you continued firing the shots, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, we continued.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Now if your intention was to shoot at Makeke, why didn't you make sure that the people you were shooting at or the person you wanted to shoot at was Makeke?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> It wasn't easy for us to do that because if the car is approaching towards your direction, you wouldn't tell the identity of the people who are inside the car.  As soon as the car approached, we started shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> How did you know that the van carried other people inside besides the driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We saw them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> What did you see?  Who did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We didn't know who they were, but we saw them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> What did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> As we were firing at this car and the car stopped and they were screaming when we were shooting and then we ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I interpose, Ms Thabethe?  You say that as the car approached you saw that there were people inside the vehicle, meaning there was more than one person inside the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, we saw that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And in your earlier testimony you say that your stated objective of this attack was directed at Makeke?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I did say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why was there a need then to do an attack on the vehicle knowing that it carried more than one person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Because we knew that even the other people who were in the car were IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But your stated objective was to attack Makeke and not IFP members and that's why you laid an ambush for Makeke, whom you knew to be driving a particular vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just on this same line as you, you were under the impression that Makeke would be driving that vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you were told that vehicle travels on that road every morning, that's why you went there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, we were not told that the vehicle drives past there, we went there to wait for the car, even if he appeared at about 12 o'clock or 1 o'clock, we were going to be there waiting for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then the follow-up question on this is, according to the record of the trial, the driver, Mr Ngobane, managed to escape.  Are you aware of that, that he was not killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, I didn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You don't know that Mr Ngobane was not killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, I didn't know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So when you left the scene, were you under the impression that Makeke was the driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, that's what we told ourselves, or that's what we believed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now why did you not kill the driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We told ourselves that we've shot at the driver and we've killed the driver.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> According also to the record of the trial, the documents on post mortem reports, a lot of children were killed and a lot of them seriously injured.  You're aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I am aware, I heard about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And that 4 of the children were shot outside of the bakkie, in the road, not in the bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, I don't know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you follow your brothers' trial when they were prosecuted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, I never went to court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you get a report from your brothers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, they didn't give me any report.  We were not in the same place and it was difficult for them to get hold of me where I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did they ever tell you that they had been tried for a crime committed by yourself in which they did not take part?</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I knew that, that they were being sentenced for a crime they didn't commit, a crime that I committed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, and you said that they knew that you had committed the crime.  I think you said your brother heard it over the radio and he deduced that you were responsible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I did mention that Tulane deduced on his own.  Tulane is not my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Oh, then my apologies there.  So your brothers never spoke to you about this incident and their predicament?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, we didn't speak to each other.  We couldn't see each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> According to the evidence also at the trial, evidence was given that some of the attackers moved around the bakkie and shot the kids from the back and from the side there, broke the windows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I don't know anything like that.  We didn't do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And that the canopy was almost shot like a sieve, if I may paraphrase.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, the canopy was shot at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You say you saw these people, but you never saw that any of them were children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You heard them scream, but you never heard that it was children screaming?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, I couldn't hear that they were children because I was running away. I couldn't tell whether the scream was from children or adults.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you, Ms Thabethe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you.  In your application on page 2, you state that your brothers, Qeda and Sibusiso were arrested and convicted and sentenced of this offence, but you haven't mentioned them here.  Would you explain why you haven't mentioned, it's page 2 number 9.4 of his application, 9(a)(iv).  My question is, were they involved in this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No they didn't, they were not involved.  They didn't take any part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Were they ever at the scene of the crime or of the offence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, they were not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You see my instructions from one of the kids who was shot, he claims that he was there and further that he pleaded with him not to shoot him, but he nevertheless shot him.  What is your response to that?  His name is Bongane Kuala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> That is a mistake, a very big mistake, because he wasn't even there, he was at eSnatengi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You have also stated that it was not your intention to kill the school children.  My question is, if you had known that this cream-white bakkie was carrying school children, would you still have attacked it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, we were not going to attack because we would have known that there were school children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But suppose the driver was Makeke?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> If we knew that Makeke was transporting school children we were not going to ambush the car because we would have known that if we attack Makeke, these children were going to be hurt or injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But now you've attacked Mr Ngobane, you didn't attack Makeke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> That was a mistake that it wasn't Makeke as I've already mentioned that we didn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> With your permission Ms Thabethe, your attention has now been drawn to paragraph 9(iv).  I intended to ask questions after Ms Thabethe has concluded her cross-examination, but maybe in the interest of time I might as well just put this question to you.  In that paragraph you state quite unequivocally the following, "that a fight broke out between the IFP and the ANC members".  Let me pause there and ask you if, was there a fight as alleged in your response to paragraph 9(iv) of your application.  Now you will recall that we already have had an application by yourself through your lawyer amending the date or the month that's reflected in that paragraph as February to March and we have done so.  So you say on the 2nd of March a fight broke out between the IFP and the ANC.  Was there a fight between the ANC and the IFP that broke out on the 2nd of March 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Not on the 2nd of March.  There was a fight on the 26th of February.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So your evidence as it stands under that paragraph is incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I wouldn't say it's a mistake, or it's incorrect.  What I can say is that there was fights between ANC and IFP from the 26th of February.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am not talking about the 26th of February, Mr Zulu.  I am talking about what you have alleged in your application as the 2nd of March 1993, not the 26th of February.  Was there a fight between the ANC and the IFP on the 2nd of March 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> On the 2nd there was not fight.  We were waiting, or we were about to launch an attack.  We don't even know whether he had a gun or not, we don't even know whether he shot or he didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was there a fight between the ANC and the IFP on the 2nd of March 1993?  I expect you to say yes or no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who against the IFP attacked you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> We were the ones who actually attacked them when we went and ambushed them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you went and ambushed Makeke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Nobody from the IFP attacked you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No, I knew that Makeke was always armed.  After we shot we ran away, I don't know if he shot back at us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You proceed to say "6 Inkatha members were fatally shot."  You proceed to say you do not know their names.  How did you know that 6 IFP members were fatally shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I heard from the radio that 6 children were killed and 15 of them were injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did the radio say these were IFP members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> The radio said children, they didn't say IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is your statement saying 6 children were shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Even though my statement is not saying so because for all I knew there were other adults in that car apart from the children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is your statement saying anything about children having been shot at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I don't think that I've mentioned anything about children but what is mentioned on my statement is that IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is incorrect to state that the radio said anything about IFP members having been shot at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I wouldn't say it's a mistake because this is what I heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, so you actually gave us incorrect facts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a>Can we have your response?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, it was a mistake.  The reason is because I heard that 6 members of IFP were killed.  It wasn't so clear that it was 6 children of IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe, you may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Madam Chair.  Mr Zulu, now how is this act of killing school children associated with a political objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Children are not associated with politics.  It wasn't our intention and aim to kill children.  We wanted to kill the person we wanted to kill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> No further questions Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just on this last point, I understand your evidence.  I want you to again consider and give me an answer.  If the person you wanted to kill who you suspected to be your target, the driver, got away and 6 children died and 9 or 15 others heavily injured, seriously injured, how can you convince us that you were really targeting the driver, if the driver escapes, certainly wounded, but he escapes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I would like this Committee to believe what I'm saying because the reason I'm here is because I cannot rest because of what I have done to those children, but it wasn't my aim to aim at children and I wasn't forced by anyone to come before this Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sardiwalla, do you have any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Chairperson, yes, just one or two points I'd like to clarify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR SARDIWALLA:</span> You were involved in this incident in 1993, on the 2nd March 1993, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> You made your statement some three years later as your application to the Amnesty Committee on the 2nd August 1996?</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> When making that statement did you apply your mind to the very specific fine details about the conflict and the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I did remember some of the things and some I cannot remember so well, but I can remember most of the things or the circumstances surrounding this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> In your initial statement you referred to, as the Chairperson indicated, to 6 Inkatha members that were fatally shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> You did not go beyond that in explaining that there were in fact children as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> This is what I heard.  I heard that they were IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Is it correct that when you were asked more details in preparing the supplementary affidavit, that you went into detail relating to the incident itself and the children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Sardiwalla, just on your earlier question, when you asked about him not having explained that they were children, he said that he heard that they were IFP members, I think that's what you put to him and I think that was his response,  whereas was his evidence not that he heard on the radio that it was children and that he cried immediately when he heard that it was children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> I accept that that was his evidence, but I am talking about at the point at which he prepared this statement.  The point I am trying to make is that it doesn't appear as though he'd applied his mind thoroughly  when he prepared this statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But the answer was "I heard that they were IFP members", that's where you led him to now in re-examination.  Can you explain that, or can he explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Mr Zulu, can you just explain that aspect that a member of the Committee has raised relating to your recent, your last statement, that they were IFP members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I stated that they were IFP members, because on the radio it was not mentioned that the children who died there were 5 years, or 6 years or 15 years.  For instance, one can become a member at the age of 15, of a political organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you.  Since when have you ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Just for clarity sake, on page 5 of your supplementary affidavit, paragraph 7, you say  "On the following day I heard over the radio that there were children in the vehicle and that 6 of the children were fatally shot and 15 injured in the ambush."  You're aware of that statement that you made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I do remember.  You consider a 15 year old as a child because that person is still a minor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes.  Now paragraph 8 in your statement, you say you spontaneously felt regret, remorse and cried bitterly thereafter.  That was the following morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I was remorse, because the moment the radio said there were children, then I knew that there were small children, not an older adult.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Not IFP members, but children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I wouldn't deny this and also I wouldn't accept this because I was scared.  I would hear some of the things and some I wouldn't hear them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you, Mr Sardiwalla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sardiwalla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you.  On the question of the vehicle, the cream and the cream-white vehicle.  Now you made reference and I think you subsequently indicated that it was the cream-white vehicle that you were targeting.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Now is it correct that it was the cream-white vehicle that you believed that Makeke used to drive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, that's what we believed, that Makeke was the driver.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And the vehicle that you had shot at, are you positive that it was in fact a cream-white vehicle with a canopy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And there's no doubt that it wasn't a white vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> No it wasn't a white bakkie.  The canopy was white but the bakkie was cream-white.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> The aspect of the conflict between the IFP and the ANC.  It appears that, and just for clarity purposes, it appears that you indicated that during or about 87, 88 there was conflict.  88, 89 people moved out to Edendale.  Did everybody move out or did some people remain?  I'm referring now specifically to ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> ANC members who fled were those who were well-known to the community and those who didn't have much property because the remaining ones didn't want to leave because they didn't know what they were going to do to their property.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> So were there many that actually remained, but relatively under cover or anonymously, as it were, but ANC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, there were those who remained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And were these members attacked from time to time, or there was no violence at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, they were attacked from time to time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Even though it was not known that they were ANC members, they didn't hold themselves out as ANC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> They would be attacked and someone will go and tell others to which political organisation I was belonging to and they will come and attack me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought I understood your evidence to be saying that people did not hold themselves out as ANC members, because they wanted to remain in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, that's how I put it, but if one doesn't like to eat a certain thing, you cannot be forced to eat something you don't like and you will do that, but eventually you will tell people, but I don't like this, I don't like eating this.  It's the same thing if you're sitting among people, you will eventually reveal that I am not for this idea and they will realise that you are not one of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At that stage was there an ANC, in 1988, 1989?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, there were ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did they call themselves ANC members, or did they belong to a particular organisation that was different from Inkatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> There were those who used to say they were IFP members whereas they were not in actual fact, because they were scared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are aware obviously that the ANC did not become an organisation as such until 1990.  Do you know to which political organisation people belonged to who were opposed to the IFP as an organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, even though the ANC was not allowed to be present, there was another organisation which used to call itself...</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and what was the name of the organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I'm trying to recall the name, I have forgotten.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sardiwalla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SARDIWALLA</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Sardiwalla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could you tell us, do you know whether Mr Saul Mkhize, Mr Khumbu Shangase and Mr Sishe Madlala are still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> I wouldn't be sure whether they are still alive or not, it has been a long time since we parted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You haven't seen them since when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> In 1994, that was the last time I saw them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Ms Thabethe, they're implicated here.  Were they informed, or what's the position?  Couldn't they be traced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> We tried, Honourable Member of the Committee, to trace them, we couldn't.  We even made an announcement on the radio, but we couldn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Sardiwalla.  Will this be the only witness you intend calling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes, Chairperson, this is the only witness I intend calling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Zulu, thank you for giving your testimony before this Committee, you may now step down.  Ms Thabethe, do you intend to call any witnesses on behalf of the objectors?  You had earlier on indicated that you intended to oppose the amnesty of Mr Zulu on behalf of the objectors.  If that is still your intention, how many witnesses do you propose calling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Madam Chair, I would propose to call two witnesses, one who will give evidence with relation to the incident itself and one who will give evidence as to the political situation in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you may proceed to call your witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Madam Chair.  I would call Mr Bernard Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you give your evidence in English?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a>Will you assist him, Ms Thabethe, he doesn't seem to be tuning in to the right channel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Can I proceed, Madam Chair?  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">BERNARD MKHIZE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Mkhize, can you please tell the Committee Members whether - which political organisation you belong to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> IFP.  I am a chairman of IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Can you tell this Committee when did you become the chairman of the IFP and in which area are you a chairman of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I became a chairman of the IFP in 1990.  Before I was a supporter and then I was elected to be a chairman of the Mboyi branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Can you explain to the Committee members what the political situation was in the area from let's say 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I will try and explain even though some of the events I wouldn't remember very well because it has been a long time.  As from 1989 there were conflicts in the area.  It wasn't in the area where I was residing but we were under one chief and I heard that it was between two political organisations but ANC wasn't a prominent organisation in the area.  The prominent organisation was IFP.  The conflict spread from that area to our area.  This was in 1990 when the fights got to the area where I was residing and ANC was defeated and then they fled, I don't know to where.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> When did the ANC, as you put it, move out of the area at Maqonqo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think they left late 1990, but I'm not sure.  Maybe it was in 1991 because I remember that I was shot in 1991.  I was shot in 1991 and I was admitted in hospital.  I stayed in hospital for a month and then after that incident I think the ANC fled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> After 1991, which political organisation existed at Maqonqo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was Inkatha, Inkatha remained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> In or after 1991, was there an area which was occupied by the ANC in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, there wasn't any area.  ANC used to come from outside to come and attack people and kill people and burn their houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Now you've heard the evidence of the applicant that in 1993 there was an attack by the IFP, it was on the 26th of February 1993, where ANC members were attacked in the area by IFP.  Do you have any knowledge, as the chairperson of the IFP at Mboyi, about this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I am not sure about the dates, but I think ANC comrades came to burn down IFP houses in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> How do you know that the people who had come to burn these areas were ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I knew this because they were swearing at us and they were shooting at people and they entered one house, I think it was Sabia's family, and they were shouting insulting words to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was this on the 26th February 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I am not certain but I think it was in February, I'm not sure of the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Do you know the applicant, Mr Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I do know him.  His father is related to my mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Do you know him when he was staying at Mboyi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I do know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Did you know him to belong to the ANC organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I didn't know his political affiliation but he never used to come to us because he was younger than us and we only realised when they talked that they belonged to another organisation, not IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> If the Committee can bear with me.  In 1993 when the school bus was attacked, was there a conflict or as the applicant put it, attacks between IFP and ANC at the Maqonqo area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, there were no longer attacks because ANC was no longer in the area.  They used to come and launch their attacks and go back to wherever they were staying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Can you clarify this to the Committee members, because I'm sure - it's not clear what you are saying.  Are you saying, because my questions is, was there still ANC/IFP conflict in the area and were there attacks between these two organisations in 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> The ANC was no longer in the area, but ANC will come from outside the area and attack people in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They would come from which areas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I will say we were staying with them before and after they fled some of them went to eNkanyezini, some of them went to Edendale, then I will say they were coming from these areas and coming to attack us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Did you know the victims, the school kids that were shot in this incident in 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Did they belong to any political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I wouldn't say that they were affiliated with any political organisation because they were still kids.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Madam Chair, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sardiwalla, do you have any questions to put to Mr Mkhize?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you Chairperson, yes, I'd like to put certain questions to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Can you go back to 1998,1999.</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Excuse me, 99?</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Sorry 89, excuse me.  Was there any conflict in the area at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> What I can say is that in 1989, as I've already explained, there were conflicts between a certain organisation which I wasn't sure of and in my area, it wasn't in the area where we were residing, but it was in another area, we were all under one chief and this spread to our area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> After it spread to your area were there quite a few killings between people at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, there were conflicts and fights and people were killed and the ANC was defeated, then they left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> You said the ANC was defeated.  You said just now you didn't know what the organisation was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> ANC were the ones who fled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> So it was the ANC people that fled.  Where did they flee to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think they went to different places, I don't think they went to one place, all of them, but they left the area where we were residing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> What happened during 1990, 91, did these people come back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> If I can estimate it's that they fled in 1990 or 1991, I am not sure of the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> If I were to put it to you that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Sorry, Madam Chair, I don't think the question was answered.  I don't think he understood the question because I understood the question to be saying did they return, and he only told you about their going away, so I think you should give him another opportunity to answer that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> During 1990, 1991 did you find that the ANC people that actually went away in 88, 89, did they return to the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry for interrupting on this question.  His evidence was that he cannot recall the date, he thinks it was 1990 or maybe even 1991 when they left.  He said he thinks it was after he had been shot when he was committed to hospital, so that was his estimate of the time when they left.  He did not say that they had left in 88, 89, that was your evidence in your question.  But I think the essence of the question is the return, let's not be too finicky about the date, let's get the flow of things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Chairperson, may I now be allowed to continue with my examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a>	Now were you not sure, there is a time that everyone returned, or many people returned to the area, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And it was then that the violence escalated again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And there were many political incidents between the ANC and the IFP at the time.  It was common knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Would you please repeat that for me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes.  It was common knowledge that there were many incidents of violence between the ANC and the IFP after the return in that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I don't understand your question very well because initially you asked me and I told you that they fought and they left the area.  The only time they were returning back, it's when they were coming to launch attacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That was not what was put to you.  What was put to you was that after some time ANC members returned to your area and pursuant to their return there was an escalation of violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> The violence was there, was continuously there as I already explained that the violence started in another area closer to ours and it came to our area and then the ANC fled and then the only time they were coming back, it's when they were launching attacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is being put to you is that after they had fled to different areas, they returned to live in your area and as a result of their return to stay in your midst, there was an escalation of violence.  Did that not happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, it never happened.  What I know is that there were fights and they fled the place.  The only time they were coming back it's when they were coming to launch attacks.  They were coming from outside to launch attacks in our areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it your evidence that the ANC members never returned to your area to stay there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, they never returned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you.  You see, the applicant has given evidence and you've heard his evidence that they were in the area in the 90's - 91, and there were repeated attacks and they lived in the area but that they were not easily identifiable as ANC members but the violence was there between the IFP and the ANC members living in that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, for all I know is that they left, including himself, he left and he never came back.  Those who were inside, who remained inside, he's the one who knows about them because as he said, I cannot easily identify them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I interrupt Mr Sardiwalla?  Are you also confirming the fact that the applicant left the area as a result of the conflict, by virtue of him having been an ANC member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I will say he was a resident in our area and I do agree that he left the area and they also came to burn down the houses from Mboyi, that's where I said I don't know whether it was on the 26th February or when.  I'm not talking about the whole area, I'm only talking about Mboyi area.  If I can count all these areas and tell you when ANC left those area, then I'll be confused.  The only time they came back is when they came to launch these attacks, but they never left and then came back and stayed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What I actually wanted to find out from you is that whether you are confirming that the applicant left the area because of political differences or issues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, he did run away because of political reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed, Mr Sardiwalla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you.  And he did come back to the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, he didn't.  He never came back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think his evidence Mr Sardiwalla, unless there is something else you want out of him, is that he would only return to launch attacks in his area, but he would be coming in from another area.  So he was residing in another area, but he would come to the area to launch attacks on IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes, Chairperson, I'm aware of that evidence, but I'm taking him to a different point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If that is so, you may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> You indicated that you know the applicant, he is a relative, but you were not too sure of his political leaning except for the fact that he didn't attend your meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Let me repeat.  I thought since he was a resident in our area, I thought that he was an IFP member.  The only time I realised that he wasn't is when he left the place and came to launch attacks on IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before, you will remember that you stated that you could tell that he wasn't an IFP member because of what he was saying or the way he was talking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> If you could please repeat that, I don't think I heard that correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your earlier evidence is that you later realised that he wasn't and IFP member through his speeches, you recall that?  And that is whilst he was still staying in your area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, I don't think this is what I said.  I said that since he was a resident in our area, I thought that he was an IFP member.  The only time I realised, or the only time it became clear is after he left and coming back to launch attacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's how I understood his earlier evidence.  He says that "I knew him when he was staying at", well I can't read the name now, "I didn't know his political affiliation because he never used to come to us, but I only realised when they talked that he belonged to another organisation and not the IFP".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I understand, but I think if I was understood that way, it was a mistake.  What I actually meant was that he was still young and he never came to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> You accept that he belonged to another organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, he did show that he was an ANC man, it became clear to me when he came back to launch attacks on IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> It was also very apparent that in that particular area there was virtual war between IFP and the ANC at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I would like you to repeat that question for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes, during that time it was apparent that there was virtual war between the IFP and the ANC in that area.  I'm talking about the Maqonqo area, Table Mountain area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> The problem is if you're talking about Maqonqo, it's another area.  What I can talk about is my area not Maqonqo area, because it's another area, Maqonqo area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Isn't Mboyi within Maqonqo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, Mboyi is just an area under Chief Mapumulo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But isn't Maqonqo the bigger are within which Mboyi falls under?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Now will you answer the question that I put to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you agree that during those years there was violence at Maqonqo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And that there were repeated attacks and counter attacks between the IFP and the ANC particularly during the period 1992,1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, in 1993 it wasn't escalating, but if you're talking about 1990, 1991, 1992 - yes it escalated those years, not 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes, but in 1993 we had this attack by the people coming from outside about a week before the children in the bus were attacked, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think there was an attack, I only have one difficulty about dates.  I'm not sure when, but there was an attack in our area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you agreed that there was an incident which occurred, you were attacked by ANC members who came from outside the area in February 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed, Mr Sardiwalla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you.  So having acceded and alluded to that, do you accept that the applicant was part of the ANC and part of the attacks that were being launched in that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I do agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Did the IFP ever attack children of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, it never happened in our area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> What - did you know Makeke?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I do know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Was Makeke a senior IFP person in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I will say I was the chairman and he was under me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say he was under you, you mean that sometimes he will act as a chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, he was just an IFP follower or supporter, he didn't have any position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> When you had meetings with the IFP was he normally present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, he used to be present in IFP meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And did he partake in the decision-making process at such meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I wouldn't say yes or no, I think it will be better to address this question to himself, not to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We would like you to explain this to us because you were the Chairperson of the organisation in the area.  In your knowledge was he a prominent member in your organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, he was a prominent member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If so, as an organisation, if you were taking a decision or if you were making decisions, was he present in those meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, usually he will listen.  There will be others who will come with ideas and who will take decisions, not him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you say he was a prominent member, why so, what was his involvement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It is easy to identify someone who likes, or who believes in an organisation, not because he held a certain position, but he was for the organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sardiwalla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you.  Thank you, Chairperson.  Evidence has been led by the applicant that there was a confrontation between the ANC and the IFP on the 26th February 1993.  Can you -  do you agree or do you not agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I think in 1993 the attack was when the children were killed and injured.  I don't know how to say about attacks but all that I know is that people were coming from outside attacking us in our area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I think he's go trouble with the date.  I don't think he really has trouble with an event round about that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> So can we accept that shortly prior to this incident when the children were killed, there was a confrontation between the ANC and the IFP members in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Are we still talking about 1993 or are we talking about another year, or are we talking about 1989?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> You don't seem to recollect dates so I'm moving away from dates.  I'm saying shortly before, weeks before, or a week before, or a week or two before this incident when the children died, there was a major confrontation between the IFP members and the ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do remember that houses were attacked and burned down in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And that they insulted Mr Sebia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Which one, which Sebia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You told us they were swearing there and that they entered the house of Mr Sebia, I'm only asking you whether that happened shortly before the children were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, it is the very same incident I was referring to that I identified them as ANC comrades because they were swearing at us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> So the situation was very volatile after that incident between the ANC and the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I will say the situation was bad for us who were inside the area, because the only people who were attacking were the people who came from outside, in other words the ANC were the ones who were coming to attack us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you, Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SARDIWALLA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you were attacked at that time, you didn't take any steps in order to protect yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, we used to protect ourselves, but this was after our houses were burned down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You didn't take steps in order to counter attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> We didn't have a specific area to attack them, because they were from another chief, from eNkanyezini, that's where they fled to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What would have stopped you entering eNkanyezini area and attack if you knew that the people who were attacking you were from there and you knew them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It wasn't easy for us to do that.  We knew that they will say when they are swearing, therefore we will know who were involved in this attack, but it wasn't easy for us to counter attack them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You were asked under cross-examination about your knowing or not of Mr Makeke, do you know what vehicle he drove?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I do know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Isuzu, a white Isuzu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you know Mr Ngobane, the person who drove the vehicle that was attacked the day the children were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was he related to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No, we are not related but we are neighbours, we are staying in one area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you lose children in that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I lost children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How old were your children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> The truth is they are my sister's kids, but they were staying with me.  I was their guardian.  I know one was 19 years old, the other one was 12 years and the other one was 9 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The white Isuzu belonging to Makeke, did it have a canopy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, but sometimes he will remove it and sometimes he will put it back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where was Makeke staying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> At Mboyi area.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Madam Chair it's Bongane Kuala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">BONGANE KUALA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> Can I proceed Madam Chair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Kuala, you were one of the people who were in the van that was attacked on the 2nd of March 1993, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Can you briefly tell the Committee members as to what happened that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> Yes.  We were going to school.  It was early in the morning.  We were in a cream-white bakkie with a white canopy.  The driver was a certain guy from the Ngobane family.  On our way we were ambushed, this was before we arrived in school.  They shot at the car.  Some kids alighted the car and they were shot outside the car.  After that, after they had shot at us, it became quiet and I had realised that my sister had passed away and three boys from the Mkhize family, they are my aunt's children, they were injured.  After it was quiet I alighted the car.  I could see that they were injured.  When it became quiet that's when I decided to check on them.  As I was checking on them, trying to chat with them, I saw Qeda Zulu approaching me.  Since he was someone I knew, I requested him not to shoot me.  He said he wouldn't let me go because he said I was going to tell the police.  I pleaded with him.  I said to him I was trying to save my sister.  He said he won't leave me because I will tell the police and then he shot at me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> When you were attacked, did you see anybody else besides Qeda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> Others I could not see because they had balaclavas, but I saw him, because we even talked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Did you belong to any political organisation at that time, in 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> No, I was still at school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Madam Chair, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> How old are you now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> 19.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So at that stage you were round about 13?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> Yes, I was 13 to turn 14.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You state that you could not recognise the others because they were wearing balaclavas.  Was Qeda not</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a>wearing a balaclava?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> He had a balaclava, but then he had removed the front part of it.  It was in his head only, that's how I recognised him and that's when I started talking to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you please slow down because you are too fast and the interpreters cannot cope with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You've pointed out as to where Qeda was standing when you were talking to him.  We would like you to explain that more so that the interpreters will interpret this, so that we can get the distance between you and Qeda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> I was sitting inside the car on the bench.  Opposite that bench there was my sister.  In the middle there was a boy and two of them were lying down, they were already dead.  The two who were inside the bakkie, I think they were still struggling.  They had been shot at.  I was still thinking as to what to do to help them.  As I was chatting with them, trying to calm them down, Qeda and them came and Qeda had removed his balaclava from the face part of it and when I saw him I said "Oh, my uncle, I didn't know it was you and now I'm begging you not to shoot me."  I started crying.  He said he wasn't going to let me go because I had already recognised him, now I was going to tell the police about him and then after that he shot me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you were talking and pleading with Qeda, asking him not to finish you, were you still inside the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> Yes, I was still inside, I was sitting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you still sitting on the bench?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And where was Qeda at this time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> He was outside the bakkie at the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you estimate the distance between where you were seated and where Qeda was standing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> I will say this is the end of the car, the end of the table is the end of the car.  I am sitting on the bench like I'm sitting here and he is right outside there at the end of the car and he saw that I was the one who was talking to these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In other words he was close, very near to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> Yes, he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When he shot at you, was he still standing there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> He walked as if he was going away to the other side of the car.  When I thought he was going, that's when he shot at me.  After that I tried to alight the car but then I got weaker and then they whistled to each other and then they left.  I lost strength and then I was unconscious and when I regained my consciousness there were police and soldiers in the area, or in that vicinity of the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where in the body did he shoot you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> Where I'm pointing, here and there, at the side under my arm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he shoot you once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> Here it's three times and there's one on my buttocks.  Yes, one on my buttocks and three under my armpit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sardiwalla do you have any questions to put to Mr Kuala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Mr Kuala, did you ever see the applicant on that day, at that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> No, I didn't see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> You say all the others that were there had their faces covered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And as I understand your evidence, after they had first shot at the car, at the vehicle, Qeda then came up.  Did he then open his face, or was it open all the time, or did you see when he did this, can you explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> I thought they had already gone.  I was busy trying to calm down those who had been injured in the car, I was chatting with them and the only time I saw him it's when he was there standing outside the car and that's when I realised him.  I thought that they had already gone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And you say when he spoke to you he said, when you begged and said to him "please don't shoot me", he said to you "now you've recognised me and you'll tell the police".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Wasn't it strange that he actually had a balaclava that he could have pulled over his face and you wouldn't have recognised him, but he chose to leave his face open so that you could recognise him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> I grew up under Qeda, he was one person I was under even in church.  After he did this, he realised that I was the only one who was still alive.  They came back and I pleaded with him to spare me, but then he refused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Has your question been answered?  Are you satisfied?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> No, it hasn't been answered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question that has been put to you is whether it wasn't strange that even though he had a balaclava, his face was not completely covered as he approached the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> I don't know why he did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> You see why I say it's strange is because all the rest you clearly saw, you saw others there, but they all had their faces covered, but it sounds very unusual that the person who actually came to the bakkie elected to uncover himself so that whoever was there could see his identity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> What I can say is that I think, I personally think that he wanted to spare me but then he was scared that I was going to tell the police, but the way he carried this thing, I could tell that he didn't want to kill me but that he was scared that I was going to tell the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> You say you had a lot of respect for Qeda because you were under him as a preacher?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Did you ever have a problem with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Sorry, Madam Chair, he didn't say he was a preacher, he said he was under him in church.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Sorry, my apologies, I'll restructure that question.   So because you grew under his care, you actually were known, you had respect for him, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> There was no conflict between yourself and him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> No, there wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Do you know what position Qeda held politically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUALA:</span> No, I didn't know.  I saw him coming and shooting at us, that's all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> I have no further questions, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SARDIWALLA</p>

<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Kuala, we'd like to thank you for coming forward and giving your testimony of the incident which happened.  It is not a nice testimony but this is what we have to do and we thank you for that.  You can now step down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sardiwalla and Ms Thabethe, are you in a position to present your oral argument?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes, Chairperson if the matter can stand down for a few minutes, just for me to confirm with client and assimilate information, I'd reckon about 4.30.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can we give you 5 minutes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You wanted to be afforded about 15 minutes,  we indicated that it's 5.  We decided in chambers that maybe we should be accommodating enough and accommodate your request in your absence.  We hope now that you have had your 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes, Chairperson, it's been a very, very fruitful 15 minutes and I intend sharing that 15 minutes with the Chairperson and members of this Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA IN ARGUMENT:</span> I have specific instructions which I need to first deal with prior to the actual issue and my specific instructions given to me in the 15 minutes are as follows</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a>	That my client feels absolute remorse, sadness and total regret for what has happened.  He wants to, and this is one of the reasons why he is here today, in the presence of the country, in the presence of the parents, publicly, not in secrecy, to profusely apologise for the incident, irrespective of what your Committee decides in this matter,  he also accepts that his remorse and regret will not bring back the children, but he is stretching his arms out and he's done that during our recess.  He says it was - this day he would never forget because during the recess he reached out to some of the parents and apologised to them.  He was not able to do it with all of them, but he intends doing it with each one of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a>	The other very touching aspect that he shared with me just now, that he's really moved by, is that for the first time in approximately 6 years he spoke to his father and his father showed compassion to him and he feels that he can build the bridges between himself and his family now that the political scene has settled down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a>	So this has been more than just a moment of shedding the burden of this weight that he's carried for the past 6 years.  He has asked me to record that and he is grateful to the Commission for having created a structure of this nature where he could do it because he could never, he had the fear in him of retaliation, the fear of whatever else would have otherwise prevented him from having a day of this kind.  So I thought that was important and I need to record this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a>	As far as what I understand Section 21 requires in an application, I submit that my client has complied with the essential three legs of an application of this nature in that he has complied with the formalities and requirements of the Act in applying for amnesty.  I also submit that it is almost common cause, having now heard the evidence of the victims, that there was clear political conflict between the IFP and the ANC and it undoubtedly emerged that it was as a direct result of this political conflict that this most unfortunate incident took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that common cause?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> If one looks at the evidence, and I'll deal with that in a short while, I'm just making the broad submissions at this stage.   It is also my submission that client was not compelled to be here, he was not being sought after, he was leading a life otherwise relatively normal, but elected of his own accord to come in public to face the people that have been affected by the incident, the process of the law and make a full disclosure.  So I believe that within his memory and within the knowledge of what transpired, I submit he has in fact made a full disclosure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a>	I'd like to now deal with these aspects relative to the evidence that was led.  If one looked at the evidence of the applicant and if one looks by and large at the factual sequence leading up to the incident that was decided on and that was adjudicated by the court in respect of the other two accused, except for the identities of the two people, the accused in that matter, the factual evidence more or less ties in to what was said by my client, the place that the incident took place, for example, the description of the road, the fact, and the Judge made some very strong statements regarding the conflict between the ANC and the IFP at the time and regards it as being common cause that there was this conflict at the time.  He found that, in his Judgment, that there was in fact common cause that there was a conflict during the time of this incident between the IFP and the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a>	What also appears to be clear from the evidence of my client, is that he was a member of the ANC.  That was undisputed.  There was some uncertainty about what organisation he belonged to prior to 1990, but I believe that is not as material to this application as his allegiance at the time of the incident.  I believe that evidence has not really been contested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It has been confirmed by Mr Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Mr Mkhize also confirmed, after a bit of explanation and persuasion, that there was in fact a volatile situation between the ANC and the IFP after the incident. Irrespective of who attacked who on the 26th or around that time, there was a volatile situation that had arisen between both organisations.  So there was clearly political strife in the area and my client clearly, from the evidence that is before this Commission, was a party to the events.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a>	If one looks at his demeanour generally as a witness, he was subdued, he was not abrasive, he was not rash and he dealt with the evidence, I believe, in a manner that any person who is asked to give evidence about detail would, almost 9 years, 8 years after, 6 years after the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Isn't our main problem, if he'd killed Makeke, that was he's instruction or that was what's decided, let's not put it as high as an instruction, then it would be a different matter altogether.  My problem is, if he'd been, not ordered, if he'd been assigned or whatever or he volunteered to kill Mr Makeke, a bakkie is driving up, he doesn't even know who is driving this bakkie, he doesn't even know whether this man is wounded, and the shots should be directed at the driver because that's the target, weren't they totally reckless as to the possible victims that might have been struck by the bullets?  Isn't that the crux of a problem for amnesty here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Can I deal with it?  Thank you.  I think we must accept that there's very little evidence, if not nothing at all, to suggest that he specifically in concert with others, had taken a decision to attack the vehicle to kill children, innocent children or any person other than Makeke.  That was the intention.  It wasn't a discussion that had taken place or an individual decision that was taken by him, it was discussed at a gathering, rightfully or wrongfully and it was generally agreed amongst all that were present that he normally goes in this cream-white vehicle and that one must ambush that vehicle, that was decided.  It wasn't him singly that decided that, the organised group decided that.  We're not talking about a situation where one stands on the top of a building in a sophisticated manner with professional training as a hit man, and knocks an individual down.  You're talking about bush war.  I think one must understand that.  These attacks are not sophisticated in their planning,  sophisticated in their implementation.  He did what he was trained to do and that is to find the target and annihilate that target.  That is the training that they received and he did precisely that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But what was the object of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> The object of the attack clearly was both the IFP member, Makeke and he was in that particular vehicle, that was the other objective.  He was - it seems as though there was a lot of discussion about the vehicle in which he normally travels and that seems to be uncontested evidence, that that was the vehicle that he was supposed to be travelling in and he was seen in transporting other IFP members and that was the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> It's also uncontested that children were daily transported on that route.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> But outside the knowledge of my client.  If he had known that, and I think he was repeatedly asked about this, he did not know that there were children also transported in a similar looking bakkie, had he known that and despite that knowledge went ahead, then we would have had serious problems, I concede, but he's never had this knowledge.  One must remember that these are people that lived in and out in hiding, not in homes, up in mountains, were there to protect themselves and attack at the appropriate time.  This was the modus operandi of both organisations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you say that he was under the impression - was his evidence not that it was indeed the same bakkie and not a similarly looking bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> He is unequivocal that it was the same bakkie and he even believes that, there's no doubt about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He knew the bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And there has been an error, he's conceded that.  I mean he said "had I known that there was another bakkie carrying children, I would never have killed, particularly my own step-nephew".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but Mr Sardiwalla, his evidence is not that there was another bakkie, his evidence is that it was the same cream-white bakkie that was known to be driven by Makeke, even though it belonged to somebody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> And what is important was that this was a decision that was made jointly, he didn't singly decide that I must do this, so it must have been thought out, it must have been - it's well and good saying in hindsight that they should have done x or y, but at the time the circumstances and the general consensus that appears amongst everyone, was that the white bakkie which Makeke drives, is the one that needs to be ambushed in this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The cream-white bakkie which he on occasions drives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes, which he was seen driving, on the applicant's evidence, at the time when one of the incidents occurred recently, where he was transporting people, members of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But let's just - are we agreed also that on the applicant's evidence he knew that it was not Makeke's bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes, he said that, he said that.  He did not attempt to be untruthful to the Commission in saying that  well he knew it was Makeke's bakkie and whatever, he said it was not but he knew that Makeke regularly drove that bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He wasn't just seen driving, it was known to him that Makeke used to drive the car occasionally and that it belonged to a person who had recently moved into the area and this information was confirmed by one Tola Cele that Makeke had been seen driving the car on the 26th February when an incident occurred on the ANC members allegedly by the IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> What is also significant, is that Kuala confirms that it was a cream-white bakkie that they were in, so if there were any doubts about the colour of the bakkie, there were some suggestions in cross-examination that it may have been the white bakkie and not the cream-white, but I think Kuala, who was in that vehicle, confirmed that it was actually a cream-white bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think the mistake was from your side, your affidavit, yes.  You may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you.  So it is my submission therefore that the target was clearly a political target.  It clearly involved an organisation or organisations that were both active, Makeke being active in the IFP and that was clear from the evidence of Mkhize, that he was an active member of the IFP.  So it wasn't as though he was an individual of his own standing and so was the applicant, he was an active member of the ANC, trained in the handling of ammunition and firearms.  So I therefore submit that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, did we have evidence that Makeke was trained in the handling of firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> No, no, I said the applicant.  It is therefore my submission that despite the fact that everything went wrong, one must look at the mind of the applicant prior to and at the time that he committed this act and there seems to be very little doubt that his mind indicated that he was actually executing the decision that was taken by the organisation, in conjunction with his comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> There's one other thing, if children were shot outside the bakkie as was - that evidence wasn't disputed - how could we then believe that in fact they only wanted to kill Makeke?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> I assume that you are now referring to Kuala's evidence?  I have some concerns about Kuala's evidence.  I have concerns about Kuala's evidence specifically as far as the aspect of identity.  To say the least, and particularly in the way it was described by Kuala, an assailant who commits a deed, an atrocity, who has the means of concealing his identity, actually displays his identity to a known person whilst the other perpetrators conceal their identity.  Now this I find highly improbable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whilst you are dealing with that aspect which seems to be giving us a little problem, because we don't know what weight now to attach to the evidence of Mr Kuala, taken in conjunction with the post mortem report, which undoubtedly you must have had sight of, in relation to the injuries sustained by the victims, the nature of the penetration of the bullets on their bodies, which would seem to indicate that some were shot quite at close range.  I don't know whether you have had sight of the post mortem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes, I've had sight of the post mortem and I'm glad, Chairperson, that you've raised that.  What appears to be the position as far as those reports are concerned is that there was continuous firing and the evidence is clear from my client that there was firing also on the canopy side of the vehicle.  I mean, he was standing on the side, they were firing all around, there were four of them.  We are looking at high calibre arms at a distance of approximately 20 paces.  We are also looking at people sitting on benches in a vehicle and you must remember that there are some people that would have had their backs facing, at the back of the vehicle, their backs facing the area from which the firing would have taken place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a>	So you may well have had, and there's no clear unequivocal evidence as to how those shots were fired, but it could well be and that is from the evidence of my client, it's my understanding of my client, that in that process they may have been shot from the canopy into their backs, resulting in rear penetration as was shown in the post mortem report.  I can't take that any further, I must concede that, I can't take that any further.  My client doesn't say -the one thing he's clear about and remember it took - his evidence which is uncontested, it took a minute or two, this was a spontaneous quick attack, in and out and that's how these attacks normally take place, with three automatic weapons firing at the same time, four automatic weapons. There's a hang of a noise, firstly, there's metal being hit continuously,  it happens for a minute of two and people are gone.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a>	Now there is some - I believe that my client's version is probable in the sense that he didn't wait to see what happened.  One doesn't normally wait.   You know that the opposite party is normally armed, that you can expect anything to happen, be it from the vehicle or from the area, if you stand there and wait for a response.  They did what they had to, they believed they had in fact completed their task, and he said so in his evidence, which is uncontested, that they thought they actually hit Makeke, they didn't see him come off the vehicle.  That was never really taken any further, that he came off prior to them escaping or running away but it seems in his mind or their minds, particularly in my client's mind, they'd hit the target and they ran off.  They heard screams, but obviously they were running for their lives as well.  	So I believe that the version that has been put by my client, taking, and one must look at the circumstances objectively here, is a probable version, without doubt.  The question one must ask, and I think Chairperson, Members of the Committee must ask, would a person who is sitting safely in a comfort zone without any indications of coercion, come up here and give a version that is totally bizarre or absurd or not in line with the truth?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a>	Now I'm just saying, there may be situations, you have more experience of them, but I am saying that I believe my client has played open cards and there may be factual discrepancies, I can concede that, there may be factual discrepancies, but if one looks at the evidence overall, the factual evidence overall both in the criminal trial and the evidence in the manner it was led, one must accept that his version is probable even having taken the evidence of the victims into account.  I think it does not necessarily attack or in any way undermine the evidence led by my client.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On that point, what possible motive would Mr Kuala have in implicating the applicant's brother of such an atrocity, when he was not present during the commission of this crime?  That is what is presently in my mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes.  One can speculate on various aspects but one of the speculations that was presented to me was that the identity of all of them was not known because our version was that their faces were all covered at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, you didn't give a version, that's where we have a problem with that.  We actually, on this point, obviously should blame our evidence leader as well, because when your client was giving evidence it was never put to him as it should have been done by our evidence leader that she will lead evidence to the effect that at the time when the people were attacked, some were wearing balaclavas and that there was one particular person who participated in the attack, whose face was uncovered.  So we have not been able to ventilate this issue because of lack of proper procedures having been followed in the leading of evidence, but you yourself did not lead this kind of evidence, so we have not been able to take the matter any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Chairperson, you know there was absolutely no need to lead that evidence in the way the cross-examination went.  It wasn't an issue at all and had I known that it was an issue, I would have certainly led that evidence because if one looks there are lots of other issues that were raised, but were not an issue at this particular hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Even on the issue where children were shot in the road, you never cross-examined on that.  So that stands uncontested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Are you referring to Kuala's evidence now?  Yes, but I said to you that my view is that, if one looks at the probabilities of the evidence that was led by him, particularly as far as ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But surely, even if the probability on one aspect of his evidence may be so, you can't say he's telling an untruth about everything.  You can't say because he may be wrong about the balaclava, that he's also wrong about the wounds he received.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Chairperson, the position, and Members of the Committee, is that as far as the evidence of the shooting of the children is concerned, my client's version is very clear on that.  My client has made it very clear that at no stage did he see or shoot at any children and that he has made very clear and Kuala did not at any stage suggest that my client in fact specifically shot at the children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We are quite aware of that and our concern is that the implication of his evidence would go to the non full disclosure of your client in so far as the attack is concerned.  Your client says he and the persons that he has identified participated in the attack and the evidence of Mr Kuala seems to suggest otherwise.  The evidence of Mr Kuala is pointedly to the fact that Qeda, who is the applicant's brother, is the one who actually shot him.  He fired four shots at him.  Now that evidence was not disputed by you.  I mean that version was not controverted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes.  Can I just respond to that?  Our version throughout, and clearly there is a factual dispute as far as identity of the perpetrators is concerned, there are two sets of facts as far as identity of the perpetrators is concerned.  What is presented by the evidence is one and what my client has submitted seems to be at total variance.  What is also clear is that our client indicated in his evidence that Qeda was not there, nor was Sibusisu there.  He indicated that in his evidence and that was not really contested.  That was not contested.  The strength of my view or my submission as far as Kuala's evidence is that the probabilities relating to identity are based on whether Qeda was actually wearing a balaclava or not.  My submission is that his version is so improbable, that it must be disbelieved on that aspect.  That he could not,  whatever motive he may have had, it's highly unlikely and improbable that a person would come and divulge his identity after perpetrating a crime of this kind, to a person that is known to him and particularly in a case where all the rest of them still had their faces covered.  So, my submission is, on that aspect, Kuala's evidence must be rejected in total, it's so improbable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was the evidence of Kuala not that the implicated individual did not reveal his identity to him, knowing who he was, but that he recognised the implicated person, Qeda and that he first addressed him and only then did he see who the individual was.  Shouldn't one also read it against the backdrop of, in terms of his evidence, of the intention really to kill everybody there?  "I also have to kill you now", and he shot again, on the basis of his evidence, whoever that individual was.  I'm not necessarily arguing that the identity was correctly established, but that such an altercation did take place in some way or another in terms of the wounds inflicted and also in terms of the post mortem, the photographs, the whole Judgment which is part of the bundle.  It's very difficult.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> There may well be wounds inflicted.  I think you concede that the identity could be an issue in question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> This is the point.  The identity could be an issue in question, but the point is this, if the identity is an issue in question, then what is not in question, not necessarily flowing, is the fact of some altercation at the back of the vehicle of two people standing next to each other, the one partly covered with a balaclava and the other one, one of the victims, whereas on the evidence of the applicant, no one got near the people, the shots were made, or the shooting was from quite a distance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> I think one must, Chairperson and Members of the Committee, must look at the evidence of the applicant's evidence as he experienced it.  Now he says what he did, what he saw.  If one of the other perpetrators did in fact go around, it's outside his knowledge, it's obvious.  It was never put to him that maybe someone did go and you did not see them, but he indicated that after he had conducted what he had done and what he had thought he had completed, he ran off.  So if a person did in fact go to that vehicle, yes it may well be, but he ran off and there's no suggestion that he was in fact the person that came there.  In fact it was put to Kuala "did you see him" and he said "I've never seen him".  So it may well be that he actually ran off whilst one of the others, be it Qeda or anybody else, let's leave the identity, that actually went up in that minute or two, around, peeped, fired a shot or two but this was pandemonium there at the time, it wasn't, you know it's not as though it's a book written thing that follows, step 1, 2 and 3.  He ran off and there's nothing to suggest that he stood there, or he went to the vehicle.  We're talking about the applicant and what he saw and what he experienced and that has been uncontested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I find out how identical Qeda is to the applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> May I approach my client on that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you may.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> My instructions are that they look different, firstly, and they've got a difference in height as well.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Thank you.  So having regard to these submissions, Chairperson, I submit that, despite the discrepancies that may have arisen as a result of the ...(indistinct) of time when he has not methodically, I am now referring to the 1987/88 issue that he was not too clear about - there was some clarity that was sought out of him as far as the white vehicle and the cream-white vehicle were concerned -overall I believe that he has complied with the requirements of Section 20 and I submit that amnesty be granted to him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE IN ARGUMENT:</span> On behalf of the victims who are opposing the application, we would argue that the applicant has not satisfied the requirements of the Act in terms of Section 20 sub-section (1)(c) and also sub-section 1(b) in that he has failed to make full disclosure and also the fact that the act or the</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a>offence of killing the school kids was not associated with a political objective.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a>	I'll start with the full disclosure.  We argue that there was no full disclosure because the victims - or my instructions which I have put to the applicant were that in 1993 the area was an IFP area, there were no ANC areas and there were no known ANC areas at Maqonqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> There were sporadic attacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> There were attacks that were done by people outside of the area.</p>

His evidence was that the applicant himself was now staying at eNkanyesini and that's where these people were coming from  They were coming outside Mboyi, they were not in Mboyi they came outside Mboyi and that the applicant, to his knowledge, was staying in eNkanyesini.</p>

However, if the evidence is that he stayed at eNkanyesini,  still eNkanyesini was known to be an IFP area. According to my instructions., there was no ANC area at Maqonqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But would it make a difference whether there was an area as such or not?  The fact is that there were attacks and that's common cause.  Also that I think they were from people who had previously fled and came from outside to lodge the attacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> It makes a difference in the sense that, according to the applicant, there were attacks that were made by the IFP towards the ANC members at Maqonqo and my instructions are that there were no such attacks that were made because, as you heard from Mr Mkhize's evidence, they did not know where they could attack the so-called ANC members because they were staying outside.  That's how I understood him.  They didn't know where to attack these people, so it does make ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The knew where to attack.  His evidence is quite pointed with regard to that aspect.  He did not want to go and attack them because it was a different chief and the chief he mentioned was the chief of eNkanyesini.  That was the evidence of Mr Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Miss Thabethe, my recollection again is that the applicant conceded that there was no ANC area as such and that some of the ANC members did return, but they moved, I think the idea used was, anonymously, living among the other people.  I don't think - but even if it was as you see it, would that</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a>really relate to disclosure in connection to what happened with the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> It would in the sense that it gives motive to the incident, the motive being that there were IFP people  attacking ANC people and as a result the ANC people had to attack back and my argument is that there were no IFP attacks towards ANC people because, according to Mr Mkhize, they would not have known where to attack them because there was no ANC area at Maqonqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Let's accept that for a moment that there weren't IFP attacks on the ANC people, but that could be something as far as disclosure is concerned, but it wouldn't reflect on the objective or the political motive of the other attacker.  Even if there were no IFP attacks, there might have been ANC attacks and according to the Act we're not looking whether there were in this particular instance attacks vice versa, there was a conflict situation and I think that's accepted by both parties.  So it would - in the sense that it would relate to the motive of the applicant, that wouldn't make a difference, but it could make a difference as far as disclosure is concerned.  Is that your point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, that's my point.  Thank you, thank you Honourable Member of the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a>	The second point on disclosure is based on the fact that the applicant says when they fired shots at the vehicle they did not know that it was children that they were firing shots at.  I would argue that I find that improbable because when they fired shots, there must have been screams from the car indicating that it's children screaming.  Further, from the evidence of Mr Kuala, he even said that he himself tried to run away and some kids were shot outside the vehicle.  So I find it very improbable that the applicant did not know that it was school kids that they had fired shots at.  Also, because he seems to suggest that they knew Makeke very well to be driving a white bakkie and they have observed him quite a number of times, I find it very strange that in their observation of Mr Makeke, they wouldn't have known of a regular trip that always occurred in that route every morning, of a cream-white bakkie that used to take school kids from their homes to work.  I find that very hard to comprehend and I would argue that if they had time to observe Makeke, observe his ins and outs with the cream-white van, they should have known that it also, more especially because he indicates it was not Makeke's car, it did not belong to him.   He must have known that it's also used, if at all it was the same car, it's also used to carry or transport school kids to school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a>	Further, I think - I argue that the applicant should have or would have foreseen that if it's not Makeke's car, or if the car doesn't belong to Makeke, when they attacked they could have been attacking the owner of the car and not Makeke, or somebody else for that matter, as it occurred in this instance and therefore caution could have been - they should have foreseen, I think they would have known, they should have known that it could carry anybody, I mean somebody else, not necessarily Makeke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a>	Also I would like to address the Committee on the identity problem that my learned friend has argued on, the fact that it's so improbable that Mr Kuala could have seen Qeda Zulu.  I would argue that I don't find it improbable because if we could for a moment imagine what was happening there, there were shots fired, according to Mr Kuala, and then it became quiet.  So probably that's when the balaclava was taken off.   Because it was quiet, he might have thought that everybody that they have shot at has been killed and that's when maybe he decided to take off his balaclava.  I mean, we can never know what the reasons are, but I don't think it's improbable that that could have happened, considering that after they fired shots, it was quiet thereafter.  They might have assumed that everybody else was shot or was dead and it was safe to take the balaclava off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a>	If you could bear with me please.  On the issue of political motive, I would argue that, in the light of the fact that they could have foreseen that not only Makeke was driving the white bakkie but maybe the owner as well could drive the bakkie, they could have exercised more caution.  The applicant has stated clearly that he had no intention to kill the school children.  He also indicated that had he known that it was school children, he would not have fired those shots.  So basically this offence - he also admitted that the killing of school children was not associated with a political objective even though there might have been attacks that were made by the ANC before that.  This specific one was not associated with a political objective at all. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a>	That is my argument Madam Chair, unless you want me to address you on a specific issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sardiwalla, do you have any reply?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA IN REPLY:</span> There is just one aspect I wish</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a>to canvass Madam Chair and Members of the Committee.  Kuala gave no evidence that the children screamed.  There's no evidence to indicate that children were screaming and the applicant would have heard the children screaming.  In fact applicant said that as he was running he heard screams but he can't say who it was, so if one tries to weigh probabilities one must look at the type of evidence that has been led and had that evidence been led one would have then looked around it and investigated, but I believe that one can't use that as being a method of attacking my client's version.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Bearing in mind that, if we accept your client's version, he was 20 paces away and all of them were using automatic weaponry and the noise must have been quite deafening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes, absolutely, absolutely and I accept that as well.  Madam Chair, that's the only real aspect I wish to raise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you say to the point that Ms Thabethe has raised with regard to the attack on the vehicle which was known not to have belonged to Makeke, was known to have been driven occasionally by Makeke, that more caution should have been exercised to ascertain that it was Makeke who was driving the vehicle on the occasion, on the incident in question, during the incident in question, because it might have been the owner who could have driven the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Chairperson, I think one must be very careful as far as this aspect is concerned, namely that my client has conceded that there has been an error as far as the target and what eventually happened, but one must look at it from what he perceived to be what he had to do and what he had in fact done.  Based on the information that the group of 20 had the night before, based on the information that everyone felt this cream-white vehicle was the vehicle that Makeke was seen driving in the area and the fact that he's transporting IFP people, based on an informed decision that they had taken, there was no talk that the owner was seen driving this vehicle, there was talk, and where this really came from one doesn't know because there was discussion around it before that decision was taken, that Makeke was the one that drives this cream-white vehicle.  They, on occasions, - but he was seen - the important thing is on one of the attacks he was seen driving that particular vehicle with members in it and it was seen in his mind and in the minds of that group as being the vehicle that Makeke normally drove and that was the vehicle that they had to ambush.  So he went with this particular picture in mind and armed with this information that, in his mind, and be it wrong, be it wrong, I'm not saying that it may be the correct impression,  be it wrong, but the impression in his mind clearly was that Makeke was the one that would be driving this cream-white vehicle and if we ambush it we're going to get Makeke, but it all went wrong completely.  It wasn't even Makeke.  It wasn't even IFP supporters that were sitting at the back, it was children.  But - in hindsight it was wrong, but if one looks at a situation and the subjective mind that was there in the applicant's,  in those circumstances, he was satisfied that he was now going to destroy Makeke.  In fact he said in his evidence that he believed that he now had shot and Makeke was there, nobody else, and that he had destroyed him and ran off.  That was what his evidence was and which is uncontested really as far as his version is concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But that's not correct, he also alluded to the fact that they saw other people and shot at them too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes, there were other people, he didn't know who they were.  He accepted that, but the target was Makeke and he had shot Makeke as far as he was concerned and he went off.  So yes, in hindsight one can say there were many things wrong with the planning and how it ought to be done and the precautions that ought to be taken, but once again I wish to urge Madam Chair and the Commission to remember that we are not dealing with a sophisticated American-style warfare plan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> The trouble is they've killed 6 other people but they didn't kill the target, the target being the driver and they don't know what happened to the driver.  He got out of the vehicle, ran away and they're not aware of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Chairperson, yes, but the point here is that when he shot and they stopped at the point when they were satisfied that the driver was in fact killed and not only the driver, but Makeke was killed.  That was his evidence.  He said that he was satisfied and that's when they ran off.  They had done their job.  One can argue now, having the benefit of hindsight, that surely you should have gone and opened the door and checked whether Makeke was there, or shone a torch before, come closer to check whether it was Makeke or somebody else, but that has all other ramifications in that situation, in a war situation literally between parties.  One must put yourself in the shoes of the applicant at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just ask one last question?  I can understand that one needs to look at the different perspectives.  Are you suggesting we should totally disregard all evidence by Kuala?  The question was put to you in the beginning, what might a possible motive be?   You simply said speculation.  But we have that evidence too before us at the moment and that's basically not contested by the applicant, except it's traversed by his own version in a sense.  But all the evidence is before us, if we are to disregard the inconsistencies there, what do we make of the other evidence which still stands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> When one looks at the court record and the Judge's views on the evidence, we must remember that Kuala at the particular time was, we said, 14 years of age...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But we can't look at the Judgment because, according to your client, it's totally wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes, well, wrong as far as the identities of the person are concerned, but if one looks at the evidence led on the other aspects, and I've alluded to that, if one looks at the factual evidence of how the incident, what happened prior and the locality of the incident, it all seems to tie in, if one looks at that aspect.  But let's deal with the aspect of Kuala's evidence per se.  That's the question I am told that I must deal with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a>	The crucial aspect of Kuala's evidence that has been led today deals with identity in my mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, that's not my problem.  I told you earlier identity is not my problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> I'm not finished with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> One aspect is identity.  The crucial aspect is identity and the second is the fact that the children were shot at close to the bakkie, whilst they were running.  Now I've responded to those Chairperson and Members of the Committee, I've responded to those.  I said that as far as the identity aspect is concerned, I believe one cannot accept his evidence.  As far as the question of the kids being shot is concerned, what is clear is that my client didn't do it, the applicant didn't do it.  What is possible, and I'm repeating what I said before, that it may be that whilst he was running off, and we don't have that evidence, that one of the others may have gone through to the vehicle and shot them.  Now I mean, we can speculate a dozen things, but in my client's mind, he went off and that evidence is not even challenged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just ask this last question then I'll leave you be on this?  Was your client's evidence not that they all shot for about 1 to 2 minutes and that they all retreated and fled then?  He did not say that some stayed behind and he fled of his own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> Yes, in his mind, that was his evidence, that's correct.  In his mind they all ran off, but I'm saying the probabilities are that one of them could have, may well have for a moment or two, gone to the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why should we rely on probabilities when we have got direct evidence on that issue?  I mean we have the evidence of Mr Zulu in this regard.  The firing took place simultaneously which lasted for a minute or two and immediately thereafter they all fled.  Why should we go elsewhere other than from the direct evidence that's presented before us on that aspect?  We can't go outside, if we have direct evidence from the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> No, I accept that, I accept that.  Maybe I must, I concede that that is the view that the Chairperson must take as far as that is concerned.  That's the direct view of the applicant and it's really for the Committee to decide to what extent it's going to rely on Kuala's evidence and the probabilities, given the circumstances at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And given the direct evidence given by your client, which seems to be presenting you with a slight difficulty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR SARDIWALLA:</span> I accept that, I accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you very much, Mr Sardiwalla, for the assistance, the invaluable assistance, may I qualify, that you've rendered to this Committee.  We sincerely thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a>	I would request the Committee Members, due to time, to strike some few matters off the roll because the way we are running, I foresee that if we start a matter, a fresh matter tomorrow, we might not finish it and it will be a part-heard.  I would therefore request that the matter of Vincent Nene be struck off.  It was supposed to be heard on Tuesday.  The matters of Magwaza ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you give the applicant's name as well as the application number?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Certainly, Madam Chair.  Mcebo Vincent Nene, reference number 5629/97, he's not in prison.  The second one is Humphrey Phakade Magwaza, reference number 6613/97, he's also not in prison.  Also the matters of Tobias Ronnie Mbanjwa, reference number 5967/97, he's also not in prison.  The last one of Sakhamuzi Harale Elvis Ndaba, reference number 6387/97, he is also not in jail.  Thank you Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Ms Thabethe.  The matters called out by Ms Thabethe are accordingly struck off the roll.  This brings us to the end of our proceedings here in Durban.  We wish to extend our warmest gratitude to all the people who made it possible for us to hold this hearing.  Our logistic officer Joe Japhta, the media people, the public, the members of the public, the legal representatives who assisted this Committee representing different applicants in different applications, the interpreters who are always faced with the difficult task of trying to interpret at ground breaking speed and our technician.  I see that we no longer have our cameraman.  Our gratitude to you all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a>	We also have to record Ms Thabethe that the matter of Mr Ngomezulu and Mr Ngcobo have been postponed sine die.  This brings us to the close of these proceedings.  Goodbye to you all.  </p>
