<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Van der Walt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Theron, your amnesty application appears in Volume 1, on page 94 to 96 and the application which you bring before this Committee is from page 97 to 101, Annexure A and then the political background and motivation, is Annexure B, on pages 102 to page 109, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> We have also heard the evidence of Mr De Kock, Mr Pienaar with regard to the two incidents for which you apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I have heard, yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And do you confirm their evidence where it is concerned to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> There was evidence that the information which was obtained with regard to these two shooting incidents, this information came from a source which you handled, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And before we continue any further, you approached me after an application was brought in that the source's name be made known and what was your instruction to me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I requested you not to make the name known.  My feeling was that I did not want to endanger the person's life and that is the only reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And are you convinced that that would be so that the person's life would be endangered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes, that is my feeling Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> This source who gave you this information, did you have, have you dealt with this source a long time before these two incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes, I have Chairperson.</p>

<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I speak under correction, but I would say it would be approximately a year, it may have been less, but approximately one year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Before this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And the information which you received through this source, did you confirm it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes Chairperson, I received several pieces of information from this source with regard to the activities of ANC members and I obtained this information and processed it and I sent it through, through the usual channels to the Regional Head Office and then to Head Office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And then you apply for amnesty for the first event, the event where the Toyota Corolla was involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And in that incident, did you also fire shots?</p>

<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And with regard to the second event, did you also receive information from your source that once again, after the first incident, persons would infiltrate the country?</p>

<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That was my deduction Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why do you say that that was a deduction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> During the planning it became clear that it would be an ambush and not a roadblock.</p>

<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> The specific information with regard to the Piet Retief incidents, was this promoted to Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, I cannot really recall whether the specific infiltration was sent through in writing, I doubt it actually.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> You say you had no doubt that the persons would be armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And your information that they would be armed, were conveyed to De Kock and C-Section?</p>

<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BOOYENS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  My Attorney has just been requested, I am referring to page 99 of the Volume 1, paragraph  8 thereon, just to put something to the witness.   You make the statement here that Colonel De Kock had given Roelf Venter to place arms in the vehicle, this must be a fault because we have heard that Martiens Ras said that he did it and in any case, according to the Attorneys who represent Mr Roelf, he was not even there?  Is that reference to Venter's name a mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, yes, after I had heard the evidence, it is quite acceptable to me, the evidence of Mr Ras that it might have been different.  Why it was mentioned was because at a stage it was mentioned that Mr Roelf Venter was there, and I assumed, but I accept the evidence of Mr Ras.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Mr Chairman, then I have just been asked to place on record that the Attorneys appearing for Mr Venter said that they will consider filing an affidavit just to confirm that their client wasn't present.</p>

With regard to the statement, that is the false statement which you made in Bundle 5, on page 47 to 49, I see it was done on the 26th of May 1989, it was signed on that date.  Is it also your recollection that it was during that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, it seems as if it is the 26th of May 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Is it that also your recollection that it was in 1989?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> The person before whom you attested to it, do you remember who it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> It was Brigadier Van Wyk.  It seems like that from the statement and as far as I could recall, it was Brigadier Van Wyk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> If you page to page 52, we will see with regard to Mr Rorich.  His was signed on the 8th of June, it seems as if it was Brigadier Van Wyk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> It seems so Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Can you independently recall, was the statement that you signed here, was it typed and prepared beforehand before you signed it, or do you recall how it happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> As far as I can recall Chairperson, Brigadier Van Wyk met with us one by one in an office.  I cannot recall whether the statement was prepared later and I signed it, but it could be so, but I cannot recall it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> You cannot recall whether a typed version was prepared beforehand, you cannot recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> No, I cannot exactly recall what the course of events was, but I recall that he called us into his office and took the statements from us, but the typed version, I cannot recall how it was signed exactly, whether it was directly thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> I also see that your statement was signed in Piet Retief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Did Brigadier Van Wyk come there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes, he stayed quite a while in Piet Retief during the investigation, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Can you recall whether you saw him once or more than once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I saw him more than once, he was there for quite some time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR LAMEY</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Moerane, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MOERANE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  With regard to what my learned friend has been asking you, is it correct that the reason why further statements had to be obtained from you and others by Brigadier Van Wyk, was that Warrant Officer Pienaar had been removed as Investigating Officer by then, as a result of objections from the representative of the families?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> That objection appears in Bundle 3(b), Chairperson, it was started in April, on the 24th of April 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Moerane, Volume 3(b)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> From the first page, yes.  The basis is laid in the cross-examination of Warrant Officer Pienaar, which covers a number of pages and his argument and finally a decision that he be removed.  Then of course, there were further things that happened, the car was examined by Captain Young, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Captain, could you just repeat the name?  Young?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Young, Basil Young.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes, I recall Captain Basil Young was there with the ballistic investigation Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And you had to go and reconstruct this scene, do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes Chairperson, in both instances there was a reconstruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes.   Even at that stage, you did not disclose the presence of Colonel De Kock as far as the second incident is concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Let's look at your first statement in Bundle 3(a), page 1.   You mention in the second paragraph that you had certain information and you received certain instructions, and the information and the instructions are the following</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>"... that insurgents or the crossing of two trained ANC terrorists would take place during the evening."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>	Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I see that Chairperson, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Now was that information that was obtained from your source?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, I cannot recall exactly how the information went about the two members, I have thought about this much and it could be that, I am not saying it is so, but it could be that I can recall there was information from the same source which would have said that the previous day or - people would have infiltrated there but it was cancelled later to another day, and it may be so that this confusion caused the two specific trained members, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Theron, you would agree that the information that you received, couldn't have involved many infiltrators coming in because it was decided to send a Toyota Corolla which would have a driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So why should you  make a mistake about two and confusing it with other information that might have been given at another time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I cannot recall exactly during this incident Chairperson, but what I do know is that there was more than one occasion which was reported to me that infiltrations would take place which did not happen and it was cancelled.  The issue with regard to the vehicle, it was a bit small, it was on short notice that we had to arrange the transport.  We in any case did not foresee that there would be more than four people infiltrating.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> But you see Mr Theron, that is the information that Mr Pienaar sent to his superiors, remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes, I see that in the statement.  I must just state that the information came from my informer, from me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> That is right.   So the information which formed the basis of this operation, was that two trained ANC cadres were going to infiltrate that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is how it appears in the report Chairperson.  I have just explained how I view the matter, that it may also be from one of the previous incidents where specific figures were mentioned, but I cannot recall the precise detail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well, you see everybody who was involved in that operation and who gives a number, for instance Barnard on page 3, he also talks about "two trained ANC terrorists during that night".</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I did not see Mr Barnard's statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> No, there it is, you can look at it now if you don't believe you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes, I believe you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I can't understand Mr Theron, why you should think that this might be confused information?  I mean it is contained in your statement, it is contained in other people's statements, what is the problem with receiving information that two people were coming in, in your mind, what do you see as a problem in this hearing about saying that your information was that two people would infiltrate rather than four?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, there were four persons who came.  I cannot imagine what came in on that day with the information, whether it was two persons or whether this was something that came through on a previous occasion.  It is not really a problem to me, I just want to put it clearly that I obtained information on more than these two occasions that there would be infiltrations from the same source.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Moerane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Ras is to the same effect on page 5 of the same Volume.   The statement taken from him on the 4th of July 1989 by Brigadier Van Wyk.  But you see the significant thing about all the statements is that there is no mention that these people would be armed, is there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I see in the statement Chairperson, that there would be two armed ANC terrorists, I didn't have time to read the rest of the statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Moerane, I am sorry, the fourth paragraph the last sentence refers to the usually well-armed terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Mr Chairman, could my attention be directed at it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> It is on this first page of Mr Theron's statement, paragraph 4, the last sentence reads</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>"... orders that we had to be well armed because trained terrorists were usually well armed during crossings,"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>	not information but indeed the probability of being armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> That is right.   At this stage, I was just dealing with information, particular, specific information that had been received.   You had not received information that the people, the two people would be armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I did not receive information that said that they would be armed specifically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> But from your past experience you believed that they might well be armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> I think you have already admitted that you took part in this massive collective perjury?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> With regard to the further investigation of this matter and the sequel to the first incident, did you receive further information, in other words after the 8th, from your source?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct.  Once again, I received information after the 8th, that there would be another infiltration.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Wasn't certain information given to you by Lieutenant Mose as to the intentions of the people who sent these people who came on the first occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes Chairperson, as far as I can recall Mr Mose informed us that one of these persons who had assisted the insurgents, once again wanted to make use of his services because there would be another infiltration.  I cannot recall whether he mentioned a specific date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Did he not say that if the first infiltration was a success, then others would follow on the Sunday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> No Chairperson, I cannot recall anything like that.  All that I can recall is that he said that they wanted to make use of him again for further infiltrations.  He did not mention any specific dates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> It was important to keep information about the events of the 8th, particularly the fact that the infiltration was not a success from the point of view of the ANC, secret from them, they shouldn't have known, they mustn't know that it was not successful?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson, for further infiltrations, it was essential to keep this story  quiet, the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Not only that, but positive steps should have been taken to put them at risk and assure them that the infiltration had been a success?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, it wasn't necessary for the informer to state completely positively that the group had reached its destination, the informer were only responsible for arranging transport, so it wasn't really necessary for the informer to report back, that is how I understood it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> But you know that he did report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes, I believe so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And she misled the ANC, which caused them to send another four people to their death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct, it wasn't the full truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Excuse me Mr Moerane, on what grounds do you know that she reported back to the ANC that the first infiltration had been successful?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, I did not say that I knew, but ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, but it was put to you that you knew that she reported back to the ANC that the first operation was a success and you answered to that positively.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Let me just state Chairperson what the informer's function was, I believe that she reported it back, because all indications were there that if she had not done so, they would not have made use of the informer's services for the second time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry Mr Moerane, but I think we need to, in the absence of this implicated person, ask a few questions about this and in her interest I think, or his interest.  This informer was an informer within Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Whom from time to time came across the border and provided information to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> At the stage when the first infiltration took place, would this informer certainly have been in Swaziland or do you have any knowledge that she was in the Republic?  We are speaking this in female form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Could you repeat please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you have any knowledge whether during the first infiltration on the 8th, where the informer found herself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> During the day of the 8th, she was in the Republic, or he was in the Republic to convey certain information to me Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That was the information regarding the infiltration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In other words the same person would have had to report that transport had been arranged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You don't know whether this person returned to Swaziland or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> This person did return to Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In order to make those arrangements, to confirm them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes, to make the arrangements, I believe so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you at any stage tell this source of yours that these persons had come through, that you had picked them up and eliminated them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> No Chairperson.  At a later stage, I informed the informer after the first incident that we had found the people, but I did not sketch the circumstances surrounding the incident and where it took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What story or what version did you want to leave with this informer, what was the informer supposed to think regarding what had taken place if you did not tell her, that you had arrested the persons in a roadblock and that you had them in detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I did not say anything about this incident to the informer, I simply said that the information which the informer had given to me, was positive and that we had also obtained positive results.   I also requested the informer to try again, that if there were going to be more infiltrations, to give me the information so that we could have a greater level of success.  I didn't say anything else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I am just going to take up your time for a short while longer, but with regard to the background, this informer is referred to constantly, but it has never been explained as to how this informer became an informer.  I want to ask you was any pressure put on the informer to be an informer, did she have a choice or was it under some form of coercion?  Did she provide voluntary information to you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you initially approach the informer to assist you, how did the informer arrive at you, were you the first contact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes, I was the first contact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You approached the informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you pay for information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes, money was handed over for services rendered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And this source was appropriately registered as an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Moerane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Thank you.  Haven't you read a statement from the source?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Repeat that please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Haven't you read a statement from the source?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, I don't understand the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We said, Mr Moerane, that we don't want the source identified, I don't want to stop you, but as long as we don't identify it until we have had the opportunity to receive representations from ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> No, I don't intend mentioning the source's name.   May I proceed?  Thank you.   You knew that the source was intimately involved with the people who sent the infiltrators into the country from Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> She knew of the arrangements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Repeat please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> She knew of the arrangements and took part in the arrangements, the identification of routes for instance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You know that she was arrested by the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Do you know how long after the second incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I was aware of it shortly after she was arrested, if the members of the ANC could arrest her in Swaziland, a short while after that, approximately two weeks later, she was abducted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, that is right, because somebody survived?  Because somebody survived the second incident, the people who were shot at on the Swaziland side, of the two, one survived and lived to tell the tale?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> No, I don't believe that had any influence on the matter Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> But you have heard the evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes Chairperson, but I don't believe that the person who survived, would have exerted any influences under these circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> In any event, between the two incidents, you must have had contact with the source?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> To arrange the second infiltration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> When did you meet her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, I cannot really recall any precise dates, but what I do recall is that the informer contacted me telephonically on the 12th, I think it was a Sunday and conveyed certain information to me, on the same day of the second incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Did you report back to her about the first incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, I have already stated here that I mentioned to her that the information that she had conveyed to me, had resulted in a successful infiltration, in the sense of the word that it was successful for our side.  But I did not tell her the circumstances surrounding the infiltration, or that the persons had been killed, or where the incident had taken place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You see, you reported back to her either that the people were arrested or they escaped or they were eliminated, now which of the three did you report back to her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, once again I simply mentioned that it had been successful, I did not say anything else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> What was she to understand by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I don't know Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> What did you intend her to understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I had no intentions for her to understand anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You had an intention, you must have understood what you are conveying to her in a particular sense.  What did you intend her to understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, I must just state I worked with an informer, I would not have conveyed any unnecessary information to this informer, unless it was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, but you have still not answered my question, you have not told this Honourable Committee what you intended her to understand by those words.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, I have already stated it clearly, I told my informer that the information that she had conveyed to me, had resulted in a successful plan.  I also requested the informer to communicate the next infiltration as speedily as possible to me, because it was important to me and the rest of our members, nothing else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Is it possible that she understood that to mean that the people had been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, to speculate about the thoughts of the informer, is something that I will not make any statements about, I really don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Really I don't think that that is acceptable, you had contact over a long period of time with this person, you recruited her for a certain action during which trained and probably armed persons would be entering the country.  This informer co-operated with you and gave you full information.  This informer would have had some idea and you would have known what that idea was, regarding your planning, whether you wanted to capture these persons, charge them and detain them or whether you wanted to kill them.  I think that it is important in particular for the informer, what your opinion is about her expectations because if she was under the impression or may have been under the impression that these persons were lured or going to be lured by you into an ambush and that they were going to be killed, and if she knew that she was going to continue with this pattern, she would be sending people to their death, otherwise she would knowingly be sending people into a situation of detention and possible torture and prosecution, you must have some idea regarding what you thought the informer was doing when she was co-operating with you?  You had known the informer for almost a year, do you have an answer for us or do you stand by your statement that you have no idea what may have been going through her mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Really Mr Chairperson with all respect, I cannot speculate about what she was thinking.  I gave as little as possible information to her.  This informer really did not know what was going to happen to the persons, she may have drawn inferences but I will stand by that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well, I will argue at the end of these proceedings that you are not making a full disclosure, I just want to be fair to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, I am telling the absolute truth, I can give you the fullest assurance of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> In other words you are telling this Honourable Committee that you conveyed information to her and you do not know what you intended to convey to her, in effect that is what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I ask another question and follow up on this?  Why didn't you tell her thank you very much for your information, we have killed all these persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, it may have occurred to me that this person would not be willing to assist again, I conveyed as little as possible information to her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Are you not saying by that that you didn't think that the informer would have co-operated if she knew that you were shooting people dead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That possibility existed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you had no impression regarding what you thought the informer thought you were busy with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> The informer knew what we were busy with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> She knew that she was sending people to their death and that you were going to shoot them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> At that stage I doubt whether he or she had that information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I cannot understand sir that you would say "thank you very much for your information, it was successful", but you have no idea in your mind as to what you wanted the informer to make of that information that you had communicated to her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Please repeat that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I find it tremendously strange that you would tell anybody thank you very much for the information that you gave me, it was successful.  You know if you tell somebody something like that, then you would understand that that person knew where the success lay or at the very least, had some notion of what you were saying about where the success lay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, I can only say that when one worked with informers, one had to be very careful, it also operated on a need to know basis.  From our side in the police or Security Branch, we needed to obtain as much information as possible to combat the ANC in their activities and we had to obtain as much information from an informer as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was this informer responsible for the transport arrangements with the insurgents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes, that is correct, on the South African side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And both infiltrations took place at the same place, the transport was taken to the same place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you Mr Moerane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you, would this be a convenient time Mr Moerane, to take the lunch adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> It would.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, we will now take the lunch adjournment until quarter to two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOCKHAT:</span> Please stand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">FLIP KOENRAAD THERON:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.   Mr Moerane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MOERANE:</span> (continued)   Thank you Mr Chairperson.   I was still asking you Mr Theron about the period between the 8th and the 12th of June 1988, about the contact you had with your source.   You have told the Honourable Committee that you reported to the source about the success of the mission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Did you discuss a further infiltration, the one that was to take place on the 12th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> What was the nature of the discussion, what did you say to her and what did she say to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, as far as I can recall, she only conveyed certain information to me, to the extent that there would be another infiltration and the date on which the infiltration would take place, that members will once again infiltrate and that was what the discussion was about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Is it correct that she was involved, at least she was to be involved as far as the ANC knew, with the transportation of these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes Chairperson, the arrangements of the transport on the South African side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, and they relied on her for transport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> That is in both incidents, the first one and the second?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And the contact was supposed to be a person by the name of Amos?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> With the first incident, yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> The Amos whom we know was Lieutenant Mose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And on the second occasion she reported to the ANC that the person who had transported these people, was Amos' brother, Johannes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson, I can recall that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And we all know that in fact that was a lie, it was Sergeant Manzini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> It was Manzini, yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> After the second incident, did you speak to your source?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes Chairperson, we had contact again.  I cannot recall exactly at which stage, but after the second incident it became general knowledge that there were shooting incidents.  I imagine that during that time, I had contacted her again Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> What report did you give to her after the second infiltration, attempted infiltration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, I cannot specifically what I mentioned to the source, but it was clear, everybody knew what had happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> No Mr Theron, you must remember that very clearly for several reasons, firstly, she must have been told by the person who survived that there was a shooting incident, secondly, it had been reported in the press particularly in Swaziland, that nine people had been killed, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, so please tell this Honourable Committee the nature of your conversation and what you reported to her, and what her attitude was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, I really cannot recall what was discussed there, but I understand the informer must have heard what the circumstances with regard to the infiltration was, but I can really not specifically recall what I mentioned to the source.  Maybe I should just mention that a handler who handles a source, wants information, not conveying information.  It has to be kept in mind the handling of sources has to be handled very sensitively.  A handler does not always know whether the source might be a double agent and as little as possible information would be conveyed to the informer, except in the case where certain information has to be obtained by the source.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Are you telling us that you also do not know how she responded, how she reacted to these events?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, I cannot really recall what the source's feeling was with regard to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Moerane, did you get the feeling that everything was all right with her, or did you get the feeling that she was nervous or worried or didn't you get any sense of feeling at all as to how she was thinking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, as far as I can recall there was a stage when some of the members of the ANC had approached her and requested her to go to another destination, it was outside Swaziland, I suspect it must be Zambia or Mozambique and that she refused to go, so I believe that she must have been nervous.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Didn't she tell you that she was now suspected of being an agent or an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> The source did mention that Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Didn't she ask for protection from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> She just asked for her money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is probably so Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> She was paid, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes, she was paid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> On what basis, was she paid a regular salary or was she paid on the basis of the information, on the basis of the number of scalps she delivered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, usually our sources were paid their travelling costs and then claims were laid for services rendered.  An active source would get more money than an inactive source.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> How much was she paid for these two incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, I cannot remember specific amounts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you give us a ball park figure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, I imagine there was a claim for something like R10 000 or R11 000 at some stage and then another amount was claimed at another stage, at a later stage but I cannot recall the exact amounts, I cannot recall all of it.   There was much - payment was made for travelling costs and other expenses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well, you were the handler so you knew about particulars of her payment, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> I am instructed that she was removed from Swaziland towards the end of July 1988 or thereabouts?  Do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes Chairperson.  I received information that during that time period, at approximately that time, she was abducted by  members of the ANC and taken to a camp in Zambia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, I think it is common cause that that was one called Sun City?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Did you have contact with her after her release?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Did you give her any further compensation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes Chairperson, she returned and reported what had happened to her.  She mentioned to me that she had lost everything and I once again applied that she be compensated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Was she compensated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> How much?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I cannot recall the exact amount, but it was much money Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well, give the learned Committee some idea what you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> R50 000, R60 000 somewhere roundabout there Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And for purposes of that further interview or contact with you, did she have to give the impression that she was being detained by the Piet Retief police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> No Chairperson, there was no mention of detentions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And to your knowledge she was not detained by the Piet Retief police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> No Chairperson, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> If that had happened, you would have known about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Definitely Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You were a member of the Security Branch station at Piet Retief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I was a member of that Branch Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And you fell under the command of Warrant Officer Pienaar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> For how many years were you so stationed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, I imagine that in 1985 or 1986 I arrived there up to approximately 1991 whereafter I was transferred to Ermelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Are you still a member of the South African Police Services?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> What is your present rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I am Superintendent Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Stationed at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Provincial Head Office Middelburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, can you explain to this Honourable Committee why you decided to involve yourself in, let's take the first incident, in murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, it was in the nature of our work, the combating of terrorism and that is how I became involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, but the prevention of terrorism is done by ordinary police methods, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, it was our primary function.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> It is done by arresting the so-called terrorists, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Arrests are part, form part of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> And shooting incidents, interrogation and then the gathering of information and putting it to use.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, but not murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> No, not murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Why did you do it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That was, if we look at these two incidents Chairperson, if one has a look at the circumstances, it was part of our work basically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> No, but you could have planned an arrest, not so?  You could have planned an arrest, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> In these specific instances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I believe that one could have arranged the circumstances so that we could make an arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, but instead you planned an ambush?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And of course that started a whole train of illegal and unlawful deeds?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Including as I have put to one of your predecessors, the corruption of the criminal justice system?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes.    I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOERANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Moerane.  Ms Lockhat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS LOCKHAT:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, I have just one question.   Mr Theron, you said in your, in cross-examination by Adv Moerane you said that the</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a> source contacted you on the 12th of June, that very same day when the second incident was planned, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOCKHAT:</span> I just want to refer you to Bundle 6, on page 6, that is the evidence of Mr Manzini in a Section 29 hearing in Johannesburg, Bundle 6, page 6, just the last paragraph there where Mr Manzini states, he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>"... I was given instructions by my Branch Commander to cooperate with them and as I have testified already, Warrant Officer Pienaar then gave further instructions to Warrant Officer Theron that he point out places to me."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>	Is that correct, did you point out places to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.  I cannot specifically recall who did what, but I imagine that I went and identified the places with Warrant Officer Pienaar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOCKHAT:</span> Then he goes further and he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>"... the first evening I went, the people did not arrive and the second evening, when I went there, I found the people there."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a>	My impression, it leaves with me that this happened over two days and it couldn't have been on the 12th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.  There was an occasion where there would have been an infiltration where the people did not arrive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOCKHAT:</span> But wasn't Mr Manzini used in this very same operation, is he referring to another operation or is he referring to the operation on the 12?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> He refers to an evening or two before the second incident took place, I received information that there would be an infiltration.   We made the necessary arrangements and Mr Manzini drove to the border, but he did not find anybody there, nobody was in the vehicle with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOCKHAT:</span> And then just one last question.  You received all this information from your source, you took it to Mr Pienaar who then took it to Mr De Kock, was it your intention, or did you foresee that they were going to be eliminated because of the information that you had given to your Commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> At that stage I did not foresee what would exactly happen, I could have foreseen that there may have been a shooting incident, but I could not foresee exactly how the planning would go about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOCKHAT:</span> But you do realise that after receiving this information from you, these people were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes, there was a strong possibility that it would happen, I did foresee it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOCKHAT:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS LOCKHAT</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Ms Van der Walt, do you have any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> No questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MS VAN DER WALT</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Adv Gcabashe, do you have any questions?  Sorry, I heard somebody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR LAMEY:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman, during cross-examination by Mr Moerane, Mr Theron testified about the information that they had surrounding the infiltration of the MK soldiers, when he gave evidence in chief, I did not understand his evidence to be, he talked of armed MK soldiers, during cross-examination of Mr Moerane he said something to the effect of MK soldiers and they assumed that they would be armed.  Could I be permitted Mr Chairperson, just to ask questions on this line?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Mr Theron, I speak of the second incident and the information that you had with regard to the second incident, can you specifically recall what the information was from the source?  Would they be armed, the insurgents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, as far as I can recall, there was no specific mention made of weapons, but I assumed that there would be weapons.  It was not specifically mentioned to me that the persons would have weapons and what type of weapons they would have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Could it have been mentioned and that you could have forgotten it by now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> It could be, but as I say, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> You see the reason why I ask you, there must have been a good reason why Vlakplaas was involved, because if the people were not armed, or if you never thought that the people would be armed, you could have done it yourself, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, with regard to infiltrations at the border fence, other than a border post, all the members' experience with regard to that would be that the people come in armed, that was the general feeling that the people would be armed.  There was no specific information with regard to the arming of the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Very well, but could that have been communicated to the Vlakplaas members that the people would be armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I did not do the reporting myself, Mr Pienaar did that and I don't know what he said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> The reason why I ask you is because Mr De Kock says in his application that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a>"... I took the decision to eliminate them because they were armed."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>	So in other words there had to be that communication?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is the inference that I draw Chairperson</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> And then Mr Pienaar says in his evidence with regard to the second incident, that Manzini would pick up armed MK members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But where is this getting us Mr Lamey, because it is all supposition, there was no, he said there is no direct, he cannot remember any specific mention of arms, there was also the arrangement that if they were armed, he would put on the indicator now, I mean why make that arrangement if you were so hundred percent sure that they were going to be armed?  That arrangement is there obviously because there is some doubt that there may or may not be armed and they all believed that there was a strong chance of them being armed.  I mean the witness has said he cannot recall any specific mention of arms, it is all just a question for argument really, I think, it is not taking us any further, this line of cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Yes Chairperson, but I just want to place on record then, just to put this to the witness that Mr Nortje whom I represent here, understood that from the information that the information was that the persons would be armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson, I stand by it that it was not specifically mentioned that there would be arms and what type of arms there would be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR LAMEY</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you. Adv Gcabashe, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> No, no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Malan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, my attention was now drawn to the Section 29 hearing where Sergeant Manzini gave evidence, once again I am addressing you in English, the evidence that he gave was that there was a previous attempt where the people did not arrive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And he refers to the second incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In other words if the people had arrived the first time, according to the evidence of De Kock and the others, the Vlakplaas people would not have been there and Mr Deetlefs would not have been there?  Was preparations made to involve any of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Yes Chairperson, there were some of the people, I do not recall specifically Vlakplaas but Mr Deetlefs was there, there were other members of the Ermelo Branch, but I cannot recall specifically whether there were any of the Vlakplaas members, but arrangements were made that if these people would come in, that the incident that took place the second time, would have happened earlier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But we have not heard from any of the other witnesses evidence to that effect, we heard that Deetlefs had come earlier and left, and it was not said or any of the other Ermelo members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is so Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> They had not given evidence with regard to the first aborted incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you say some of the Ermelo people were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And some of the Vlakplaas people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I cannot recall specifically Chairperson, I cannot recall whether some of them were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are there any questions arising out of questions that had been put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MOERANE:</span> Yes</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a>Mr Chairman, thank you.   You see my instructions are that there was an earlier attempt to infiltrate two persons on the 5th of June 1988, what is your comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Chairperson,  I cannot specifically recall but there were instances where there was a possible infiltration which never took place, but I cannot recall whether it was definitely that case.  I don't know whether the arrangements were made.  I have forgotten whether that had taken place, I cannot recall, but there was more than one occasion where there were possible infiltrations and that the persons had not arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And one of the persons that were supposed to be infiltrated on that first occasion, was a deceased, Mr Lanny Naidoo, any comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> It could be so Chairperson.  The information that I obtained was not with regard to names, I did not have any names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And that is probably the occasion to which Mr Manzini is referring?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> No Chairperson.   Mr Manzini would not have been used, it would have been Captain Mose, so in this instance which Mr Manzini refers to, was before the second incident, after the first incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well, I suggest to you that Vlakplaas was not involved in that one, the one of the 5th of June, that is why it would have involved Mr Manzini and not Lieutenant Mose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> No Chairperson, definitely not.  It could be that there was some planning for the 5th, that you mention but I don't have dates, and I imagine that there we did make some arrangements and as far as I can recall the Vlakplaas members were there.  I cannot say specifically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well, I put it to you that between the 8th and the 12th, there was no aborted infiltration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> I think there was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> When, the 9th, 10th, 11th, when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Between the 8th and the 12th, I don't remember exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well, I suggest to you that after the 8th you received information from Lieutenant Mose that if that infiltration was successful, the one of the 8th, then people would be sent through on Sunday, the 12th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> As I have said earlier Chairperson, the information that I received from Mr Manzini or from Captain Mose rather,  was that they told him that they would use him again, but I cannot recall a date.   The information from the 12th, the infiltration, I received from the source.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Mr Theron, aren't you giving this evidence now in an attempt to protect Mr Manzini who has not made an application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR THERON:</span> Not at all Chairperson, I am only speaking the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOERANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Theron, that concludes your evidence, you may stand down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
