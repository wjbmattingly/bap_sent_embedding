I spoke to Mr Larreman yesterday, one of the traffic officers who was also a complainant in the matter.\n\tMay I firstly just put on record that Mr Larreman does not oppose the application and asked me to convey that to the Committee.  He informed me that he was very close to Mr Groenewald.  Mr Groenewald was severely traumatised as a result of the shooting incident, had left the police force and had left Natal to go up to the Transvaal somewhere, and although he was very close to him, he has also lost track of him and hasn't been contacted by Mr Groenewald in a number of years.  Be that as it may, I would ask the Committee in due course to refer Mr Groenewald to the R & R Committee and obviously they will endeavour to track him down.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.",

            "The applicant in this matter asks for amnesty in respect of the possession of a machine gun, ammunition and possession of grenades and attempted murder.\n\tOn the evidence before us and on the information contained in the bundle put before us, Exhibit A, it is clear that on the day in question, that is on the 1st of July 1991, the applicant and his companions had travelled down from Pietermaritzburg through Durban to Port Shepstone.  They did so in the course of their duties as members of Umkhonto weSizwe, and the purpose of the visit was to enable firearms to be obtained which could then be used on behalf of Umkhonto weSizwe in the Pietermaritzburg district.\n\tThe firearms were obtained from the Transkei from ANC sources, and that morning they left Port Shepstone. Shortly after they had commenced their journey they noticed a police vehicle following them.  It later caused them to stop.  \n\tPolicemen got out and first asked for the licence of the vehicle and then indicated, I think it is quite clear, an intention to search the vehicle.  The weapons were inside the vehicle, they were not in the boot of the car which was found to be empty.  When the police approached the vehicle itself, we are told that Sergeant Groenewald drew his pistol whereupon one of the applicants companions drew his gun and opened fire on Sergeant Groenewald.\n\tThey drove away and were pursued by the police.  They came upon other police vehicles and roadblocks and there was firing between them and the policeman and ultimately their car came to a halt.  They fled into the bush, where the applicant was arrested.  He was subsequently charged and convicted of attempted murder and various contraventions of the Arms and Ammunition Act.\n\tWe are satisfied that the applicant was acting on behalf of Umkhonto weSizwe, as part of what was then contemplated was the struggle for the liberation of the country and that there was no personal motive involved, nor were the firearms to be used for anything other than the objects of Umkhonto weSizwe.\n\tWe are satisfied that he has complied with the requirements of the Amnesty Act, and that the acts for which he seeks amnesty were acts committed with a political objective in terms of the Act.\n\tThe information before us is to the effect that he was in possession of a Stechkin pistol which is a form of automatic pistol, and a great deal of ammunition as well as the handgrenades but on appeal his conviction for possession of the two AK47 rifles was set aside and there is no application before us, and this has been confirmed by his counsel, in respect of the AK47s.\n\tWe accordingly GRANT THE APPLICANT AMNESTY IN RESPECT OF THE ACT OR ACTS OF ATTEMPTED MURDER COMMITTED ON THE 1ST OF JULY 1991 on the road between Hibberdene and Port Shepstone and in respect of THE CONTRAVENTIONS OF THE ARMS AND AMMUNITION ACT, relating to the possession of a 9mm Stechkin pistol and 466 rounds of 9mm ammunition and 537 rounds of AK47 machine rifle ammunition and three handgrenades at the same time and place.\n\tWe are informed that it has not been possible to make contact with SERGEANT GROENEWALD who was severely wounded in the incident.  He has retired from the police force and has lost contact with those who knew him in the past.  We are nevertheless satisfied that HE IS A VICTIM and we direct that his name be referred to the R & R Committee with a request that they do what they can to enquire as to his whereabouts and to loss or damage he may have suffered.\n\tThat concludes our decision in this matter.",
