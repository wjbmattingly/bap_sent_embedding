<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And what position did you hold in the African National Congress?</p>

<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Dlamini, is it correct that during 86 you had attacked a mobile police station as well as a school, for which you apply for amnesty today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> The attack that you launched against the school and the mobile police station, who did you receive the orders from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> We received our instructions from Ravi, who was the Commander at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the name?  Just repeat the name please, Interpreter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Ralph.  I beg your pardon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, sorry Mr Panday.  Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Dlamini, does Ralph have a surname as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No I do not remember his surname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> What was Ralph's position in the organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> He was our Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And I take it that Ralph also belonged to the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Now, at the time when you received the orders from Ralph, where were you based?</p>

<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, I missed it, who was based in Swaziland?  The witness or Ralph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Chairman, the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The witness, the applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Yes.  Mr Dlamini, you were based in Swaziland and where was Ralph based?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> He was also in Swaziland at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Now, do you know who gave Ralph the instructions to attack the two places?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, I do not have knowledge thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> You mentioned that you were based in Swaziland.  How did you come into South Africa from Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Through Ingwavuma.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you linked to Umkhonto weSizwe, were you part of the military machinery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you receive military training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is also correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you were operating within MK when you got the orders in Swaziland to come and execute here in KwaZulu Natal, here in Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Panday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Do you know of any persons that assisted you in coming into the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> There were people who assisted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> What are their names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> It was Charles Ndaba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And where is Charles Ndaba now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> As far as I know, he was murdered by the boers, they threw him into a river somewhere in KwaZulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Now Mr Dlamini, this attack that was launched against the two places, where did you the bombs from, or the grenades that were specifically used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I crossed the border from Swaziland and they were in my possession.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And who had given these grenades to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> They were given to me by Ralph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Would you happen to know how Ralph was able to obtain such items?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, I do not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Now Mr Dlamini, after you, or before we go to that question - were you assisted in the province by any other persons to attack the two places?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, there were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And what are the names of the persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Baba Majola and Mdudusi Kala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And do you know the whereabouts of the two persons who assisted you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Unfortunately they are both deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What were their positions?  How do they fit into this whole operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I operated with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were they also part of MK, or where did they fit in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, they were MK members whom I had recruited and trained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright.  Thank you.  Mr Panday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Dlamini, did these two people enter South Africa with you from Swaziland or did you meet them in South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I met them inside the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And where were they based inside the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> At Sobanto, Pietermaritzburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Do you recall what positions they held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> We did not have positions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Dlamini, the police station that was bombed, do you recall the day that it was bombed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Although I cannot be certain, but I think it was on a Wednesday or Thursday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> If I had to put it to you that it was more specifically on the 13th of August, 1986, would I be correct in that assumption?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I would not dispute that because I'm also not very certain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> The Sobanto School that was used as a military base, was that bombed on the same day as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Do you recall the day or month that it was bombed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I cannot recall it because it happened 10 years ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Dlamini, the decision that was taken to bomb the school was obviously by Ralph as you have testified, now more importantly, by bombing the school and the mobile police station, what was to be achieved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Let me start by saying that at that time there was a struggle to end the apartheid system in South Africa, so police and soldiers were protecting that system of government.  That is why some of the operations were directed at the police because they stood in the way of getting to our objective which was toppling the apartheid government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Dlamini, the Sobanto area, or the area where the police station and mobile, the school and the mobile police station was, do you recall what political area it was?  Which party was dominant in that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Although I cannot be certain but there was a political organisation that existed at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which one?  Which political party was dominant in the Sobanto area at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> It was the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now when, you say you can't remember the specific date of the incident at the Sobanto School, in which year was it?  Was it in the same year, was it also in 1986, the same year as you attacked the mobile police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't have a better idea as to when in the year that happened?  You can't remember the month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> As I mentioned before, a long time has elapsed, so I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can only remember it was in that year during 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright.  Mr Panday, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Dlamini, just to assist Mr Chairman a bit further, could you recall if the attack was after the bombing of the mobile police station or before the bombing of the mobile station, the attack on Sobanto High School?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> The first attack was on the police station and then the military base school was the second.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Now Mr Dlamini, do you know of any particular reason why the military base was established in the Sobanto area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> As I mentioned before the police and soldiers were the protectors of the apartheid system.  At that time the country seemed ungovernable and so they were put there to watch the situation and be able to curb whatever activities are directed towards the government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Now Mr Dlamini, after the attack on the school and the military base, did you become aware of any persons that were injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Do you know any of the names of the victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I do not know their names except for the fact that I heard from the evidence leader today that some white person was injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Now Mr Dlamini, you indicated that in your application, that you received a report later about the injuries to persons.  Who forwarded this report to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Please repeat that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> The report that you received about persons who were injured after the attack on the police station and the high school, do you know the name of the person who gave you this report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> There is no specific person who gave me the report but the attack was mentioned in the media so I think I learned of it that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And Mr Dlamini, after the attack on the school and the mobile police station, were you arrested soon thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No, it was a long while before I was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Do you recall roughly how long later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I think two or three months elapsed before my arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And during the period of the two or three months prior to your arrest, where were you in that period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I was at Sobanto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And while in Sobanto, were you hiding from the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> I resided in a house that the police did not know about because at the time our organisations were banned so if you were found out or discovered you would be arrested, so I can say yes, I was hiding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were operating underground, your operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now when you were convicted, the terrorism charge was it in respect of both these two incidents, the mobile police station as well as the school, both those attacks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what sentence were you given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Ten years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ten years.  And you spent some time at Robben Island?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you were released, you were admitted to Robben Island on the 25th of August 1987, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That is correct.  I cannot remember the month quite well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you were released on the 27th of April 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  Mr Panday, is there anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Just one further question, Mr Chairman.  Mr Dlamini, when you were underground in the house that you mentioned, was anyone assisting from remaining underground?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, there were persons who assisted me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Do you recall any of the person's names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> What are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Zanele Ngubane and Moses Jabulane Mkhize, Baba Majola and Mdudusi Kala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Dlamini, you mentioned the two persons Baba Majola and Zanele, the deceased, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Baba is the one who is deceased.  Zanele is still alive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Okay and the other persons that assisted you, do you know what has become of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes ...(mike turned off)</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And where are they residing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> At Pietermaritzburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Dlamini, just one further question.  Did you benefit financially from your attack on the mobile police station and Sobanto School?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No.  There were no financial benefits that we received for carrying out our operations.  It was just on a volunteer basis to topple the apartheid government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> In so far as your application is concerned, besides what you've already mentioned to the Commission, is there anything further you would like to put to the Commission or inform the Commission of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PANDAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Panday.  Mr Mapoma, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Mr Dlamini, Zanele Ngubane and Moses Mkhize were your co-accused, is that correct, when you were convicted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Were they involved in these particular operations, that is the attack on the school and the police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Are those the offences for which they were convicted as well, or were they convicted of different acts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLAMINI:</span> Different cases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Chairperson, I got no further questions</p>

<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> ...(indistinct - mike not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR PANDAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Dlamini, you are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there any other evidence you are tendering?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the applicant's case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma are you tendering any evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> No further evidence Chairperson, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, have you got any submissions, Mr Panday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> I shall not burden the Commission too long.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY IN ARGUMENT:</span> It is quite clear from the evidence led by the applicant that the purpose of the attack on the mobile police station as well as the Sobanto High School that was used as a temporary military base, was obviously for the furtherance of a political objective, a political cause of that of the ANC which at the time was, as it is common knowledge, a liberation movement and these attacks were solely for the purpose of uplifting that liberation organisation and furthering the cause of the organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>	From the evidence it may be inferred, or it is clear that the existence of the military base as well as the police station would have suppressed this organisation and the attacks were purely for that purpose and as such the applicant was acting for the promotion of the liberation organisation and accordingly we submit that he should be entitled to the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Panday.  Any submissions Mr Mapoma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Nothing Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I assume you don't have anything further?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Yes, that concludes the formal aspect of this application.  The Panel will endeavour to formulate a decision in this matter as soon as circumstances permit when we will notify the parties.  So under those circumstances, the decision in this matter is reserved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> As Mr Chairman pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Panday, we thank you in anticipation.  We know you've got some further business here, but thank you for your assistance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, may I be temporarily excused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Won't you just switch off that microphone as well while you are at it?  Thank you very much.  Mr Mapoma, what is the next matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> The next matter Chairperson will be that of Osmond Nkwanyana and Mpilo Khuzwayo.  They are both legally represented but I do not see their legal representatives here now.  Perhaps ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Perhaps somebody will just have a, will just see where they are.  Both the applicants are here, are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Messrs Nkwanyana and Khuzwayo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, they are here, in fact the legal representatives are here as well.  I wonder Chairperson ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were they possibly still consulting with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes when we are dealing with this matter, I wonder Chairperson, if it's not a convenient time to break perhaps?  I see it's 11 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I wonder, can somebody just ascertain whether they are able to proceed?  Oh, okay.  You don't have your list of ...(microphone turned off)</p>
