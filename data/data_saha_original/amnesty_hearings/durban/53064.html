<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay, now were you also a person who was travelling in a kombi that went passed the compound that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZONDI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Did you see the deceased?</p>

<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay, after you saw the deceased, where did you go to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZONDI:</span> I went home with my brothers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay, and is it true that later that afternoon, you were part of a group of people that accosted the deceased and began assaulting her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZONDI:</span> Yes, I did partake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> And did you also end up going to the home of Mr Msolo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZONDI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Did you also take part in stabbing the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZONDI:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Do you know how many times you stabbed her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZONDI:</span> No, I can't quite remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Did you belong to any particular structures of the ANC at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZONDI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Which structure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZONDI:</span> I was an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay, but as far as you were concerned, what was the relationship between members of the ANC and the IFP, was it a close, friendly one, or was it a hostile one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZONDI:</span> Hostile one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay.  And is the fact that an ANC member had been seen in the IFP stronghold, that gave rise to the events of that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZONDI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> How do you feel about the fact that this person lost her life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZONDI:</span> It is hurting that a person had died in that particular way, actually it is hurtful, anybody's death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Here again, members of the Committee, I don't wish to take this witness through every other aspect of the matter, and I leave him in your hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SIPHO</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Thabete, do you have any questions to put to the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETE:</span> Just one question Mr Chairman.  Was it the norm that if an ANC person was seen in an IFP area, he or she would be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZONDI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Do you have an example of an incident that had occurred before where a person was attacked, how that person was attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZONDI:</span> Yes, a person would be killed when an IFP member entered the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETE</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> None.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR SIPHO</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Lax?  Mr Sibanyoni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> No questions, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Zondi, did you have your own knife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZONDI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you stab the deceased more than once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZONDI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you stabbed her, was she standing up or laying down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZONDI:</span> She was standing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And when you - after the stabbing when you left the deceased, was she in your view, dead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZONDI:</span> Well, I wouldn't be accurate in that sense, but due to the fact that there was plenty of us, it was evident to us that she would die.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Sipho, any questions arising?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SIPHO</p>

<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETE</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Zondi, you may stand down.</p>
