And later on during the course of the Commission, amnesty applications were then received.\n\t\tWhen the two were put together, both the victims, the missing, the disappeared and the amnesty applications, there was some meeting of the two and we were able to marry some of those that had disappeared, together with some of the amnesty applications that had been received.\n\t\tWe then, in this particular case with the Port Natal Security Branch, received a bundle which included applications from Andy Taylor, Hentie Botha, Sam du Preez and Wasserman, plus some others, and we were able then to split the number of cases between us within the office and we started doing what was then called 'special investigations' around specific cases and I was allocated this specific case as part of my brief.\n\t\tEssentially we were looking at the veracity of the statements that had been received in terms of the amnesty applications and verifying, in terms of what had been said, that this was correct and that it could be backed up by other evidence.\n\t\tIn this particular case, one of the problems that arose was there was a conflict in that Andy Taylor, who was the Commander of the group, applied for amnesty for possible murder of Ntombi Kubheka whereas some of the others had applied for hiding her death in that she had died of natural causes, and essentially it then became fairly important to try and trace why there was this discrepancy. \n\t\tAndy Taylor at the time had come in for what we called a Section 29, which was held in our offices in Durban and he was questioned and answered, but what became apparent was that he wasn't there the entire period of her, the period that she was held in Winkelspruit, whereas some of the other members had been there more of the time.\n\t\tThere was quite a lot of conflict between Hentie Botha's statement and those of other parties who'd applied for amnesty, in that he was adamant she died of natural causes, some of the other people who said she died of natural causes, in fact were not present and were repeating what they had been told.  One of the askaris gave conflicting evidence and it became quite difficult to determine what in fact happened on that day.\"",

There were coincidences such as, in some of the cases where there were exhumations, where the amnesty applicants fairly consistently said that the reason that these people had been killed and the manner in which they had been killed and disposed of and the manner in which they had been disposed, was because they were aware of the fact that they couldn't be convicted in a court of law.  \n\t\tAnd in our discussions with Botha and others at the exhumation sites and at other times, it appeared that their intelligence at the time must have been fairly good, in that they were infiltrating a substantial amount of MK cells in the country at that time, or in the Port Natal region at that time, and these people were disappearing.\"",

The second person, a very similar scenario was found in KwaMashu area, but it had been strangled and was a child, it was a new born child, which we couldn't tell from the initial records.  Or didn't note from the original records.\n\t\tThe second book was of greater value to us, because it was during the period, it was from May until August, I believe, and most of the woman recorded in that book had either at the time been identified or subsequently someone had come and identified them.  And in most cases, the person identifying them had arranged the burial, they hadn't been buried as paupers.  So we'd eliminated them.\n\t\t465, in terms of age and height was inappropriate, she'd also been stabbed and found in a different area.  \t514, although the age could have been correct, we understood that Ntombi was overweight and 60 kilos didn't seem to indicate being considerably overweight, but she was also a victim of a motor accident.  So whilst a person being disposed of on the road could have been a victim and subsequently run over by a vehicle, it was also freshly brought into the mortuary and not a decomposed body, and given the dates that we knew that Ntombi had disappeared and that she had died immediately, there was no possibility that this would have been the body.  \n\t\tSubsequently, some of those listed were from hospital and 580 was the most likely candidate when we completed our search through the books.  The person had not been identified, had been buried in a pauper's grave, had been brought in approximately two months after disappearance.  \n\t\tAccording to the forensic pathologist, the decomposition as recorded would have been appropriate for somebody who had died two months previously, could have died two months previously.

As a result of which the local community, both the political divisions had SPUs and SDUs posted at night.  Two white men in a, what was identifiable as a likely police vehicle, if it was a Skyline, disposing of a body on the side of the road, would have been observed, given the situation that prevailed in Natal at the time.
