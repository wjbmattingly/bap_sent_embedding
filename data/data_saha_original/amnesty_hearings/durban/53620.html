<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Visser, before I ask Mr Webster, are there any other few remaining questions you wish to adduce from your witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I had a nagging feeling yesterday afternoon that there was something and there was.  May I - just two matters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Wasserman, you're still under your former oath which you took yesterday to speak the truth and you are still bound in conscience to speak the truth, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">LAWRENCE GERALD WASSERMAN:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Mr Wasserman, just reverting to the scene of the shooting, what I neglected to clarify with you yesterday is as we understand it, Lembede drove your kombi after you had shot from the kombi into this car.  He drove it in front of that car, of the fugitive car, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And then he braked, he stopped the kombi and then there was a collision by the fugitive's car with your kombi from the rear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now, what happened to the vehicles after this collision?  Can you just explain that to the Committee please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, after that collision at the back, the force of the collision pushed our kombi forward, all slowly, pushed the kombi forward, whereupon</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>Lembede and I alighted the kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, now just before you get to that, when the two vehicles, the kombi and the fugitive car came to a standstill, were they up close to each other, or was there a gap left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, when the action was finished, the vehicles smacked into each other, there was no gap.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  So they got to the standstill together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Together.  Yes, correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You and Lembede then got out of the kombi, I take it on the left-hand side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, I came out the sliding door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And he came out the front passenger door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Right.  Did you fire at that car after you got out of the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I did, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> With your service pistol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And then as you explained to the Committee, suddenly there was firing coming from the North.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman, as I got out of the vehicle and ran towards the suspect vehicle, the Reaction Unit Personnel were aligHting their vehicles and they were also coming in towards the suspects vehicle and they commenced firing at it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Can you tell the Committee whether you can distinguish the reports of firearms to some degree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I can, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What do you say were the Reaction Unit firing with from what you heard there that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I distinctly heard the sounds of R1.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> R1 assault rifles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> R1 assault rifles, 762 and there was automatic 9mm fire as well, presumably Uzzi's or HMCs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes and was there a lot of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> There were volleys of fire, there was a lot of gunfire, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that caused you and Lembede to take flight up the embankment to save yourselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Because you were in the line of fire, being on the southern side, if that was the southern side of - I'm not sure of the points of the compass, but we know what we're talking about.  You were in front of the fugitive's car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Wasserman, lastly, it was suggested to some of the witnesses, I don't remember whom, but certainly to Botha, I'm not sure on what evidence it was suggested, but it was suggested that you might have and if I say you, I mean the royal you, might have decided beforehand that you were going to kill these terrorists at whatever costs.  Was such a decision taken beforehand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, no decision was taken.  I was not informed of such a decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What weapons did you have available while you were chasing this car with the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I had my service R1 rifle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you have it that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I had it with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If you knew that you were going to ambush and kill four terrorists, what would you have used as a weapon to do that with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I would have taken my R1 rifle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Which you didn't?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I left it in Col Taylor's vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you talked about firing coming from the north, that's the first time this direction is mentioned.  All the vehicles were in fact facing south at that stage, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So then, the firing that may have come from the members of the Reaction Unit, they were in motor vehicles and where were these motor vehicles at the stage that they were firing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, when I alighted from the kombi, the vehicles, the Reaction vehicles, I seem to recall two of them, they had stopped in the road behind, possibly 30,40 metres.  Parties alighted from both vehicles.  That would now be on the left-hand side of the suspects' vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just make that clear.  When you say on the left-hand side, do you mean on the left-hand side of the suspects' vehicle with its nose as a reference point or with yourself and the suspects' car on the left-hand side as a reference point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, with the nose of the suspects' vehicle, the Reaction Unit came from the back from the sort of left corner and from the back on the right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So they alighted from both of the vehicles and what did they do after they alighted from those vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They ran towards where we were, they ran towards both vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say ran towards both vehicles, what vehicles are you talking about, the suspects' vehicle and?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And the kombi, they had collided.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I beg your pardon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They were together now.  Almost together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, at this point in time I was between them, or myself and Lembede were directly in line of fire and I grabbed Lembede by the arm.  I could see what was going to happen, Sir and I and Lembede then ran up the embankment, right up the top onto the outer ring road, well out of the firing line now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This embankment you talk about, would that be on the left-hand side of the road facing south?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir the right-hand side of the road facing south.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So did you run right across to the other side of the highway?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, no Mr Chairman, I can explain it like this.  The off ramp went down.  We were on the highway.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Then they took the off ramp that went down.  The shooting took place at the bottom and I then ran up to the top.  Lembede and I sat at the top.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Webster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr Wasserman, you were born in Rhodesia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was born in Zambia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Was it in Zambia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> But at some stage you went to Rhodesia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And you regarded Rhodesia as your home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You were in the Armed Forces of Rhodesia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You fought with Zano?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And Zipra.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And Zipra.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> A most unpleasant experience, I take it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They were under strenuous times, difficult situations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Very difficult situations for you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You carry emotional scars from that experience?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir,</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> The unpleasant experiences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> At the hands of black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not necessarily.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> There were the hands of black people.  Zano and Zipra were black people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, they were not only black people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Are you wanting to tell me that the freedom fighters in Zimbabwe consisted of white people as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You don't make issue of that, but they were predominantly black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And at the end of the day it was black people that took control of the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And you had to flee your homes in Zimbabwe because of black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Because black people took over you moved away from Rhodesia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, you say he had to flee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> My apologies, thank you Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>You had to leave Rhodesia because black people had taken over the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Don't say you had to leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I didn't have to leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say he had to leave implying that he was compelled to leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Or probably let me put it this way, you then decided to leave because Rhodesia was now in the hands of black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No I decided to leave because Rhodesia was in the hands of communists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> They were predominantly black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> It was Mr Mogabe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And you - I'll leave it there.  Mr Wasserman, I'm not going to point a finger at you, a sanctimonious finger at you and probably say that I'm better than you.  I don't know how you feel, but I'm suggesting to you that you must have had intense dislike for black people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, that's absolute nonsense.  My unit were 90% black.  I have even to this date a terribly good relationship with black persons.  Mr Chairman, I deny that emphatically,  it's absolutely untrue.  My units were 90% black, possibly even more and to this date I still have very good report with black people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Yes, Mr Wasserman you may even have had 99% of black people under your service but that does not preclude you from having had utter contempt for those underlings who were serving a purpose that was common with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's totally incorrect Mr Chairman, in fact black people were my Commanders in the Rhodesian Forces and they gave me orders, so that is incorrect, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> But you were fighting for the Rhodesian Forces, were you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think that that is not really relevant here, please.  Just come down to his participation here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr chairman, it's just that I think Mr Wasserman wants to throw in a dirty punch ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's because you asked him questions relating to what happened outside the borders of South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> I'm talking about, Chairman, 90% of the black people under him in South Africa and he then decides to cross the boundary, the borders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well let's get down to ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Let's stick to the borders of South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Let's get down to the events here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Now, when you came to South Africa, you decided to support the National Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Because the National Party virtually had an anti black philosophy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They were the government of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And they believed that blacks should be underlings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr Chairman ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm terribly sorry to interrupt my learned friend.  Mr Chairman my learned friend told you on what basis he was opposing this application.  This witness has told you that he did fire at the occupants of the motor car.  It is difficult to understand how it is relevant whether or not this witness hated blacks for purposes of assisting this Committee Mr Chairman, of deciding whether amnesty should be granted or not and really Mr Chairman, not only is it irrelevant, but it's so unnecessary to dig up all this old hatred and what goes along with it, in this proceedings, Mr Chairman, and I would ask you seriously to stop my learned friend.  Let him get down to the facts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wasserman, you joined the South African Police when you came into the Republic, is that it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that your first employment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, was it because of your political persuasion or your belief in the Nationalist Government that you joined the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, I can say it like this.  When I was involved in Zipra operations, the ANC were moving in Zambia under the Zipra guise and as a result of that I was getting in touch with the SA ANC, the South African ANC and when that war finished I then brought that knowledge and that with me over to this side.  That's the reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That gives you the background, now let's get down to the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr Chairman...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see all these people were policemen.  They may all have been born and bred as nationalists, but I don't think that we have the time to go into an explanation as to why that was so.  We don't have that time to go into all those details.  You've got to concede that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> With respect, Mr Chairman, I concede that and whilst I concede that, I think it is highly improper of Counsel for the applicant, to interrupt on a point I'm building up to.  I might as well say to the person I'm cross-examining "Here is a list of questions I want to put. They relate pertinently to these issues relating to the incident and leave out all the background and just get on with it, on just what he wants to be an application completed for an amnesty granted to the applicant.  That is the task of the Commission and not me or counsel for the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm not going to interrupt you or prevent  you from cross-examining and I want your assistance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In confining the cross-examination to the issues about which we have heard, relating to the death, the unfortunate killing of those poor people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And as I've indicated Mr Chairman, I'm going to suggest it to Mr Wasserman, let counsel be at rest and at peace that I'm not dragging up hatred, but that I want to bring out the fact that when they went out that day, they didn't intend to apprehend the people in the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, well...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And if I'm not going to be having background...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Although ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Of their thought process, then I don't know how I'm going to get it out of him unless I say Mr Wasserman, you must have wanted to kill them, you didn't want to arrest them, comes the answer, no that is not so, no further questions.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can develop that argument.  You can put that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Thank you, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You know where we are going to Mr Wasserman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I know where we are going to but ask the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You'll get the questions.  You'll get the questions.  You have amnesty in respect of many killings, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> How many?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I think 14 Sir, I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> 14?  And in all those 14 instances people whom you murdered were suspects, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They were terrorists, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> They were suspects, were they not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Terrorists, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr Wasserman, were they not suspect people, suspected of having broken the law?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They were terrorists, Sir, perhaps they did break the law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Were terrorists not people who had contravened the law?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> So why don't you want to admit that they were suspects?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Perhaps they were suspects.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Why do you say perhaps?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I'm not sure ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Are you now suggesting that as long as a person had been identified as a terrorist, you felt justified in killing him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Certainly not, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> So were those people in respect of whom you have applied, suspects?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They were suspects, I suppose, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> They were and in those instances, you did not attempt to apprehend them, you shot and killed them.  Some you put limpet mines into their mouths and blew them, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's not so, Sir, I'm not an explosives expert.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Okay, let's leave the limpet mine business, but you shot and killed them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You made no attempt to apprehend them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I apprehended many of these on other occasions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> I'm talking of the people that you shot and killed.  You did not intend apprehending - in fact some of them had been apprehended but were then taken out and shot, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Execution style, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> To cut a very long story short, I don't believe, I don't believe you one iota when you say that on that Sunday and with these four terrorists, as you call them, that you had any intention whatsoever to apprehend them.  Your answer is going to be no, is it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I'm going to answer now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, those four men were meant to be armed with their AKs.  That was the information.  I have had combat experience, rather a lot, I would never, ever go into a gun fight with four armed men with my service 9 mm pistol with 15 rounds.  I would not fancy my chances of coming out of that fight good enough.  So my briefing was very definite, they were to  be - an arrest attempt was to be made on these four people.  In fact I didn't even take my R1 service rifle out of Col Taylor's vehicle.  that is what happened on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Do you appreciate the significance of what you've just said Mr Wasserman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I've said it and I stand by what I've said, Sir</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You want me to believe, you want the Commission to believe that people armed that you were going to apprehend, people armed with AK47s, terrorists who were armed with AK47s just carrying your service pistol?  That's what you want the Commission to believe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, the Reaction Unit was going to effect the arrest.  They were heavily armed.  I was not going to.  I had my service pistol on me, that was it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Please, Mr Wasserman, you've said you were going to arrest those people.  Have you not said so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> the operation was to arrest those people.  I was not to be involved in the arrest operation, the Reaction Unit was to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> So your intention was not to arrest, that was the responsibility of the Reaction Unit, is that it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was their responsibility, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And not your business?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not my business.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought you said that the operation was to arrest these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now is that different from your business and their business?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No not at all, Sir, but on the presumption that they were armed and the Reaction Unit was also heavily armed, they wee going to be the principle parties in the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Let's get back to the station,police station, kwaMashu police station.  you said that before the information was relayed that the vehicle had left wherever it was, that there were a lot of policemen at the police station, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Had there been a meeting held up until that stage involving all the policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, there must have been a meeting.  When I got there I was just informed what had happened.  Col Taylor came and informed me what the situation was that was happening there.  There wasn't a meeting that I was involved with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> If I recall what's in your application, you said you arrived there and after your arrival more police officers arrived, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's very possible Sir, there were many policemen there and possibly others did arrive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Are you suggesting that that allegation I make is not in your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> May you point out where it is, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> I'm asking you.  Just a yes or a no and then we get on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Upon my arrival there a large number of policemen had congregated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Is that where you stop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And then I did say that I was informed that a ... of MK operatives ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Okay, in so far as you wee concerned, no meeting was held after you arrived there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was not subject or party to any meeting Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> That's a round about way of saying yes, we'll carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And from the time that you arrived to the time that the message was received that the vehicle was then moving away, in other words, the Cressida was moving away, how long was that period approximately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How long after he arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Yes after he arrived, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I'd say possibly 2 and a half, 3 hours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Okay, so in the 2 and a half to 3 hours, there is no co-ordination of discussion.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Thank you.  You were not privy to any plan by the Reaction Unit to apprehend these people, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was informed by Col Taylor that the Reaction Unit would operate in this operation, he informed me of that, but I was not privy to the plan of what it would be and everything like that, I was a Sergeant at this time, so I was not to be privy to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You had absolutely no clue what they were going to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Oh yes, I was told that they would try and effect the arrest away from the house along the road.  I was informed of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> What I'm saying is the clue about the plan, you had no clue about the plan, their plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, not the Reaction Unit plan, no Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Is it correct that you perceived your role, that is now after the vehicle had, Cressida had moved away, you perceived your role purely as that of Intelligence basically, in other words you were to relay information of the location of this vehicle to the Reaction Unit so that they could put their plan into operation, is that not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's what the part should have been, yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Was that not the instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The instruction was to - well there was a bit of pandemonium when the message was that they had left and we were not, we went to great pains to make sure that we could catch up with the vehicle, so that we could inform the team what was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr Wasserman, was that not the briefing, was that not the plan that you would act as Intelligence and once the vehicle with the suspects had been seen, you would then relay the information to the Reaction Unit, was that not the plan Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, I didn't have Reaction Unit channels, so I couldn't relay to the Reaction Unit.  I could have relayed to perhaps the other Security Branch Members, Col Botha and Gen Steyn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Are you then saying that there was absolutely no plan of what was to be done once the vehicle was seen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I'm not saying that.  I, when we found and located the vehicle, we reported to Col Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> My question to you is, there was no plan as to what was to be done once the vehicle had been seen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The plan was to report it back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Who to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I told you, Col Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> For what purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Just to say we've got the vehicle visual.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And thereafter, what was to be done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The Reaction Unit would eventually move in and try and effectively stop the vehicle and arrest the ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And how would they know where you were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Col Taylor - Col Botha must have radio contact with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You don't know whether that was in fact the arrangement or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He would have had a radio Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You do not know whether that in fact was the arrangement or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I wouldn't know Sir, but I know that he had a radio with him.  My radio was a Security Branch radio, it had no open channel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mmm, I'm getting a picture of confused bungling and ineptitude on the part not only of the Reaction Unit but in particular your unity which was made up of a General, a Colonel, two Colonels, a Sergeant, well we won't talk about blacks there, we don't care about their ranks or whatever, but was that, is that the correct picture I get?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In hindsight, things did go a little awry there, that is for certain, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You want the Commission to believe that for 2 and a half hours a General, I'm trying to see where he is, a General, Col Botha, Col Taylor,  no plan, no instruction coming out to you and that when the information comes, people just run helter skelter into vehicles and there's just a general pandemonium, is that the correct picture?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> But there's nothing else that you've said which seems to suggest any order or any plan.  Is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, there was a plan.  The Reaction Unit were to do the rest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> I'm talking about the Special Branch, Mr Wasserman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The Special Branch were to 'surveil' the vehicle as best as possible and give the Reaction Unit the time and the task and the readiness to go forward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mmm, which they did not do.  Is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It never got to that.  A shooting incident occurred before it got to that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Who was the first to shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Col Botha shot first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And who was the second to shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Lembede.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Then who was the third to shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Who was the fourth to shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No more idea Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> As far as you recall, who was the fourth to shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It would have been Reaction Unit members, but personalities, no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You could see shooting coming out from Botha's vehicle, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I could hear the shooting, I couldn't see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You could hear shooting from Botha's vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You could see Lembede firing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You heard no other shooting except shooting from these vehicles of the Special Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That was 9 mm shooting, I could that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You could clearly hear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You know the sound of an AK?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You never heard the sound of an AK?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> I suppose you'd also know the sound of what's that Russian effective handgun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Makarov.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Makarov?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You didn't hear that either?  There was no shooting whatsoever coming from the suspects' vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> That you heard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, but Col Botha's car was very close to their car so ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr Wasserman, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I am answering.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, could the witness just be allowed to finish the answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think the question was, you heard no shooting coming from the suspects' vehicle?  That's the question as I understand it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Thank you Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.  I understand the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the answer to that was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Two vehicles, side by side, one cannot tell if there's two metres between two vehicles, you cannot tell which vehicle the firing is actually coming from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You couldn't say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, you couldn't say, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr Wasserman, I am amazed.  I'm amazed.  I'm shocked.  You have just said that the first person to start firing was Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Mr Chairman, you've heard my evidence here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And you heard the firing coming from Botha's vehicle.  You've then said that Lembede was the second to fire because you could see him, he was in front of you and you said that you were the third to start firing because you know that you were firing and you heard no firing from the suspect vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We ascertained that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Because the next firing that you heard was from the Reaction Unit, was that not what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's what I said, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Now, the firing for us in the VW, in the kombi, the firing from Col Botha, I believe W/O Lembede believed that was coming from the vehicle of the suspects.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Lembede's dead, is he not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, he was killed in action.   The ANC terrorists killed Michael Lembede in Umbumbulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> I'm not interested in that and I don't want us to talk about what went through Lembede's mind.  He's dead, let's leave him alone.  You have said you heard firing coming out from Botha and you have said Botha was the first to start firing.  I repeat it, you said the second was Lembede because you could see him firing.  You said the third was yourself and the fourth was the Reaction Unit.  Do you remember saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Clearly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I remember, however, I want to make a point here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The shooting, Col Botha's shooting, was definitely from our position and our information of armed men in that car, that shot we presumed, we didn't know it was Botha, we presumed those people were about to commence, or had commenced fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is what happened there.  Thereafter Lembede opened fire.  When he opened fire, I opened the sliding door shortly after that and I commenced to open fire on the people inside that motor vehicle.  That's what was happening there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You didn't care to check whether there was any firing coming from the vehicle, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Webster, I presume you've been in gunfights, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I doubt that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Well, I've probably been under worse firing, not gunfire, but under worse firing than that, intellectually speaking, but I'm not the person that is testifying.  I will proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What were you saying, Mr Wasserman, you were going to say that he may have been under gunfire, so what was the point you were trying to make, Mr Wasserman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Webster was asking me if we bothered to check.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I'm not sure how we check that you are under gunfire, but they are chaotic, Mr Chairman, not one gunfight is orderly in real life and as soon as two parties were firing, I entered the gunfight ... as well.  There was no time to check and identify if rifles were up and what rifles they were.  We were also scared, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Anyway.  The impression I get from your evidence is that when you heard the first shot go off, although on the evidence it is Mr Botha who said that he fired that first shot and which you confirmed, at that time you were under the impression that the firing came from the suspect vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's very definite, yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But then you didn't have an opportunity to examine where the fire came from because all this happened very quickly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You weren't able to really check.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> The hypothesis that's just been put by the Chairman to you, if that is in fact the correct interpretation, why then under cross-examination not so long ago, did you say that you heard firing, the first firing that you heard came from Botha's vehicle.  Why did you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Because that's the evidence I've heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> That's the evidence you heard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I heard it yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> So you are tailoring your evidence to evidence as you are sitting and hearing it being adduced here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> So why did you then adopt something that is not your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We ascertained that Col Botha started the firing and that reacted over to us.  We've ascertained that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You see, Mr Wasserman, when you said the first person to start firing was Botha, you said the basis fro your saying that the first person to start firing was Botha was because as you've said, you heard the shots coming from his vehicle.  Do you remember saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You don't remember saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> But I do recall where the shots came from and the two vehicles were there next to each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Now I want to put it to you that you just grabbed onto the hypothesis by the Chairperson because you think it's a life line, taking you out of what you have said regarding who fired first and how you determined who was firing first, but the record will show that you were in no doubt, not because of what you heard but because of what you alleged to have heard on that day.  What's your response?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, your interpretation is the correct one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Did anybody give you an order to fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Did anybody give you an order to kill the four occupants of the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Why did you then lie and say Col Taylor gave you that order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> When did I say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now just wait, is that the record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> My learned friend tells the witness that he's lying based on no evidence at all, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Give him a chance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr Chairman, I have a document here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> If Mr Visser will open to page 25.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Of what document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Of the bundle of the applications by Steyn, Wasserman and Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Paragraph 11 (b)</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, page 25.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> It starts at 11 (a).</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman with respect, where does it say here that Botha and Taylor ordered him to shoot?  That's the question.  And he says to this witness he's lying because he says Botha and Taylor did not order him to shoot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does it say in this paragraph, Mr Webster?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> "Daad/Dade, Versuim/Versuime", it goes on and there it says</p>

<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr Chairman, I was still speaking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let the witness explain that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, with respect, please just give me one moment to point out the obvious to you.  That doesn't even refer to this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr Chairman, with respect, Mr Wasserman is no idiot and the interpretation that's going to come out is the answer which  Mr Wasserman is going to stick to.  Let the witness answer for himself, please Mr Chairman, you've made that order, thank you.  I'll abide by the order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is my duty to see to it.</p>

<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No I think that we'll save time.  Just let Mr Wasserman explain what he said there, that's all.</p>

<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, except, may I just point to page 29 of that bundle, that is where the answers are relating to this incident which you will find at pages 27 and 28.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let Mr Wasserman then answer.  Mr Wasserman, have you got this page before you?  Page 25, paragraph 11 (b).  This seems to be your answer to the application for amnesty and paragraph 11 (a) and (b).  Will you kindly look at it.  Take your time, read it.  Have you found it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I've found it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, this is the bundle of the papers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just switch on your microphone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, that applies to another incident which I applied for amnesty, it is not the Quarry Road Incident.  I think Mr Webster has got the wrong bundle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Webster, is that the answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Let's go to page 29.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where are we on page 29?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Again paragraph 11(a) and 11(b).  The same question.  This time it was Maj Gen Steyn who gave you the order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Put your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Is it not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The order to do what Mr Chairman, with respect.  The order to do what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that what paragraph 11(a) and (b) says?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr Chairman, paragraph 11(a) and 11(b) as I think Mr Visser well understands, relates to the incidents or the occurrences of the unlawful conduct in respect of which amnesty is sought.  It does not distinguish one from the other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you say we're talking about the Quarry Road Incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wasserman, have you read paragraph 11(a) and (b) or page 29.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And Mr Chairman, may I just add, with your kind permission, or the three mentioned, expressly mentioned crimes that amnesty is being sought, I think the latter two can be regarded as subordinate and of not particular relevance and at least importance as the murder of 4 human beings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well now let's just - I think that he's really saying, you know, nobody gave me the order to fire.  You are now putting questions to him on this basis to suggest that in fact he was given an order to fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And this is the implication and the answer that, the interpretation that one can attach to the answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there any other interpretation you can place on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Unless it becomes selective to say that if it is in my interest to say it related only to planting the firearms and being in unlawful possession of firearms then that answer makes, will be acceptable but it will not make sense in so far as it relates to the most important issue and that is the killing of four human beings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright now, Mr Webster.  Mr Webster are you saying in paragraph 11(a) and (b) that you were given an order to fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, no Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What are you saying there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That Gen Steyn condoned my actions and was the senior officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He condoned what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> My shooting action.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright.  Is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, can you take it any further?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> We'll proceed Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You then must have deposed an affidavit regarding this incident, did you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Sorry, Mr Webster, say again, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> I then repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You must have ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You must have deposed to an affidavit afterwards, regarding this incident, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I made an affidavit to my lawyer, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> I'm talking of many years ago.  On the 7th or the 8th or as was reasonably possible, or was expected of a  police officer who had shot 4 unarmed people, to make a report regarding the incident, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir, I made no affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You made no report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Col Des Botha informed me he would make the necessary affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Who informed you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Col Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> So you made no affidavit regarding this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I made no affidavit, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To whom Mr Webster are you suggesting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> An affidavit, regardless of who to, regarding the incident, after the incident had occurred and as distinguished from the amnesty applications.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Your amnesty application is dated I think December 11, 1996.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And when was the cut-off date for amnesty applications?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I think it was the 12th Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Of December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> It was the 14th, just for the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> The 14th of December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Thanks Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And how long before - sorry, and when was the amnesty procedure adopted, or became part of law, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't understand you, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Was it March 1995?  I think it's 1995.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a>The point that I'm trying to make is, you had ample opportunity to have made an application, but you left it till almost, or two days before, or three days before the deadline, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is so, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And when you made this application, you must have been in a position to remember what had happened, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I remembered some facts Sir, but not enough.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Why were they not enough?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not enough to commit to paper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And as was pointed out previously, it's only when all three of you got together and all three of you came up with a common story, that it was committed to paper, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And that is even how you've testified.  You've sat here and listened to the other applicants and your evidence is tailored to suit what has been said by the others, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> In short, what I'm suggesting to you is that even your applications are nothing but a conspiracy.  Do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't agree Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> That for some inexplicable reason three senior police officers cannot remember the incident, they get together, they then remember the incident and from then onwards, each of them is clear about the facts of this incident.  You don't find that strange?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is not the evidence, Mr Chairman.  I just want to place it on record.  The question is ill-based.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where are we getting?  I understand the purpose of your cross-examination, but let's be direct, that this is a concoction, if you are saying ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> That this in fact is a concoction and that you are still trying to defend your actions and you're still trying to minimise your culpability, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, that's certainly not so.  I'm here before the Committee, I have actually admitted to shooting at the four persons and shooting and hitting the four persons, that is my evidence.  There is no reason to concoct anything that is less than that.  What purpose would there be in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You admit to shooting the four persons and you admit to hitting the four persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Where in your application do you admit to hitting the four persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I might have hit one or more of the applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr Chairman, I might be mistaken.  Can the witness be afforded the opportunity o locate that, with your kind permission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I beg your pardon, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You've told us earlier that you fired at the people in the car.  Now, you've told us now that you hit some of those people and the question now is, this is the first time I hear you say that you actually hit the people in the car as distinct from shooting at them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Paragraph 11 at page 3 of the exhibit, Mr Chairman</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it Exhibit D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Indeed, Mr Chairman.   Page 3, paragraph 11 the last sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The last sentence reads as follows</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a>"I was unable to get a steady aim.  I shot in the direction of the vehicle and I might have hit one or more of the occupants.  I fired 15 rounds."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a>Yes, can we proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr Wasserman, the statement that you hit four of them is new, do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He didn't say he hit four of them, Mr Chairman.  Where does my learned friend get this from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think we should spar here.  He fired at four people in the car.  He shot some of them.  I don't think he counted, who, which and where.  It will be unrealistic to expect that he is able to say this after 13 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Well, with respect, Mr Chairman, that I would have absolutely no quarrel with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then let's just proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And in the same manner I would have no quarrel with the witness sticking to this version that I might have hit one or more of the occupants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> But he is stating under oath now he hit four of them.  He said so, I didn't say so.  As a fact, as a statement of fact, not as a speculations or conjecture, with respect, Mr Chairman, he has said so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said that just now that you hit four people?  Is that what you are trying to say?  Please explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I fired at a vehicle, a small space of four persons, there is a possibility that I hit one of the four or all four.  I fired 15 rounds and that enclosed enclosure of a motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr Wasserman, help me now.  Your intention is to arrest people.  You encounter the vehicle, you shoot and empty your entire magazine on the occupants of the vehicle.  Were you trying to arrest them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> there was no longer an attempt to arrest.  Once we had thought that we were under fire from that vehicle there was no more, there was no intention of arresting further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And you see what I'm actually now putting to you finally is this and bearing in mind what you said regarding the first shots that you heard, that the action came from Mr Botha because you heard them, that you intended to kill these people, you didn't intend to arrest them, that is why all that you did was you heard Mr Botha fire and you fired to kill, never to arrest, because it had never been your intention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's not correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Now I'm going to suggest further, Mr Wasserman, that that, that those actions or that action of yours, was consistent with what you had been doing prior to this incident, executing suspects.  Your response?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> What suspects?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You call them terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> What terrorists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> The ones that you have applied for amnesty for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That was all after this happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Be it before or after I am saying it is conduct that is consistent, Mr Wasserman, with your execution of suspects.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not true Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And I'm going to suggest, as I started initially, that you found the opportunity in the Special Branch to pay back or in your mind, the scores from Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is an outrageous statement and I reject it utterly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Further, can you tell the Commission why it is that when you made your application you made no reference to firing of, or possible firing of Uzzis, HMs and R1s by the Reaction Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I merely said a large number of shots were fired by the Reaction Unit.  At that point in time I didn't deem it necessary and I would lead that evidence here before the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> I suppose you don't see the relevance of the various types of firearms that fire different sizes of ammunition in so far as relates to the examination of the injuries and the post mortems?  You don't see the relevance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> ...(inaudible - no microphone)</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All the words of the evidence are not let out.  This is an application for amnesty, the application form, you understand?  We are guided by the evidence he gives here and this is obviously an expansion of what is contained in the application form, so if some of the details are not in the application form, but are given here in oral evidence, that is what matters, isn't it?  Unless you are suggesting that this was purposely concealed from us, purposely not mentioned in the application form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr Chairman and members of the Commission, you will pardon me for having that suspicion in mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR WEBSTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Visser, re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> None thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr Wasserman, I don't know whether you will be able to assist me here, but how often did it happen that the Special Branch or Security Branch asked the Reaction Unit to assist them in operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was a very regular occurrence, Ma'am.  Very regular indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> So this was not unusual at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you.  I have no more questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Wasserman, just one aspect.  I wasn't actually intending to ask you any questions, but this is one thing that's occurred to me and it's the issue of what happened when you alighted from the vehicle, once both vehicles - well the way I understand it, both vehicles were literally joined from the impact and came to a standstill.  This is the suspect vehicle and the kombi that you were in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not so, Mr Lax.  When - that's how they came to rest but after the initial collision with us, we were pushed forward.  After being pushed forward Lembede and I alighted from our vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Alright.  Now, what I'm just trying to get a better picture of is what happened when you got out of the vehicle.  You have given two slightly different versions of what happened and I just want to clarify that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Okay Sir, I can clarify for you.  Lembede and I alighted and approached the suspect vehicle which was now still going forward in the same line as ours was.  Him and I were both still firing our pistols and behind, started on both sides of the vehicle, came the Reaction Unit boys, they were on foot.  Their vehicle had stopped and they were 'debusing', they were coming towards us.  Their rifles were up and they had started to fire.  I then grabbed Lembede and I ran between the back of my vehicle and the front of their vehicle, before it collided and proceeded up the bank then.  Whilst proceeding up the bank, heavy fire opened up from the Reaction chaps.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see earlier in your evidence and if I remember correctly, was your evidence in chief, you spoke of bullets whistling past you and you guys nearly being shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct.  That was at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And the impression I got was that all hell had broken loose and you guys just ran for your lives.  Now that was the impression you gave in your evidence in chief.  Under cross-examination you gave a slightly different version which was that initially the chaps from the reaction Unit were not firing as heavily and that allowed you to see what would happen.  That's what you said.  You said, "I could see what was going to happen".  Do you remember?  Those were your specific words.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.  Yes.  I - when they 'debussed' and they approached that vehicle, I knew now Lembede and I were in trouble.  I knew that and that is when I grabbed him by the arm and then we ran out and I presume that they didn't open fire because they had seen us in the firing line and as soon as we were out, that is when all hell broke loose, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see there's just this slight contradiction here to bullets whistling past you and your lives being in serious danger and you seeing what would happen and getting out of the way before it became too dangerous.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It's perhaps just the choice of words from my legal personnel.  Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr Wasserman, I raised this issue yesterday.  I wish to raise it again.  The Act, the Amnesty Act provides in the preamble that since the Constitution states that in order to advance reconciliation and reconstruction, amnesty shall be granted in respect of acts, etc.  How, Mr Wasserman, in your own mind, speaking for yourself, if amnesty were granted to you, would it advance reconciliation in a country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, Mr Chairman, at this point in time and with hindsight, there was an awful lot of military action from both sides.  Umkhonto weSizwe were pretty rough, their selection of targets I deem were not as clinical as ours, they attacked far more civilians and it caused us to fight fire with fire and in hindsight now, I regret the fact that a war was actually fought and I hope that we can put it all behind us.  However, we were forced to fight back and I believe we did so honourably, but I do regret the loss of life that occurred in all aspects throughout the South African struggle and I hope it is over and we go forward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman, there's just one aspect that I omitted to Mr Wasserman which does not arise from questions that have been put after I've completed my cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, please do.</p>

<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You did say it's just one question, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> It's just one aspect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr Wasserman, you were then allegedly sent to kwaMashu to fetch arms, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> that is so, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You do not know the address of the house that you went to, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You do not know whether that it in fact had been the house where these people allegedly had been during that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't know that Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> It could have been in fact the house of the informer or the black member that went with and he got them out of this house.  You cannot help the Commission with that aspect, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I didn't see the house.  I was asked to stop, because I'm a white man, I was asked to stop away from the spot.  The member and I genuinely cannot recall this man, the member then alighted.  It was dark.  He went off and very, very shortly after that, he came back with the sports bag containing weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You don't know where he went to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He couldn't have been far from where I had stopped, but I do not know where he'd gone to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> You don't know which way they even got them out of the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't know if he got them out of the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR WEBSTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In paragraph 16, you deal with this aspect of the matter in Exhibit D.  Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I do, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you said that back at the scene of the shooting</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a>"I handed the bag to Director Botha in such a way as not to be seen by others on the scene."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a>What does that mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, the kombi that I was in and the victim's motor vehicle was still in position, I then reversed the vehicle that I was in with the bag with the weapons.  I drove it very, very close to where Col Botha was standing and we opened the doors and the bag was then slipped to Mr Botha and then he proceeded to plant the weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, the idea is about, I'm concerned really about this having been done purposely to avoid not being seen by others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir,</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's what I'm concerned with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The others were other policemen at the scene, they were not party to our action.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought the other policemen that were there were the Reaction Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Sir, but by this time even city police and other parties were coming, it was a public place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So what did it matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We never at any moment thought that the weapons would not be in the vehicle.  Once I had finished the shooting and Reaction had finished the shooting and we found no weapons in there, it was a problem for us.  I was then instructed to go and get the weapons which we knew belonged to this unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand that.  My question was, why did you do it in such a way so that it could not be seen by the other police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We were busy now with a cover-up, Mr Chairman and we didn't want other parties to have any knowledge at all of this activity of ours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Yes, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Visser, any further witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No thank you Mr Chairman, that's the evidence which we wish to present to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Mr Webster?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER ADDRESSES:</span> Mr Chairman at this stage I would ask for the indulgence of the Commission to postpone the hearing to some time next week.  I'd indicated to the Leader of the Evidence the difficulty in which I am and the importance for at least three aspects to be investigated.  Attempts have been, not even attempts, investigations have commenced and a, Chairman you will remember that I've asked Mr Wasserman about Breytenbach.  Mr Breytenbach is not prepared to make a statement yet until he has received guidance, legal guidance regarding that statement that he might make.  I would like to speak to, or at least have an idea of the evidence of Mr Wasserman before I waste the Commission's time by going on a wild goose chase saying that I'm calling a witness when I have no idea what he is going to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, you mean Breytenbach, you said Wasserman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In other words you are saying there's a possibility that you might call Mr Breytenbach?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Mr Breytenbach.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And we might also locate the owner of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No you would be telling us that from the beginning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> That is so, Mr Chairman, but unfortunately we don't have the resources to locate these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but then you see, I told you yesterday, it might take months to locate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> No, Mr Chairman, the type of postponement we are seeking is not an indefinite one, but rather some time next week, Wednesday or Thursday.  I believe the Commission has other work that it can continue with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No the Commission doesn't have other work on Wednesday and Thursday.  The Commission at present is doing work in such a way that we might sit on Monday.  We are hoping to start a matter today.  If it doesn't finish tomorrow, we'll finish it on Monday, which means that immediately thereafter we'll deal with your matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Well, Mr Chairman, if that is the position, we will then fall in line with the availability of the Commission, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You understand there are all kinds of considerations ...(indistinct- microphone turned off) ...unnecessarily unreasonable or anything of the kind, we were hoping to complete this application today in fact.  We are under the impression that you had time yesterday to contact Breytenbach and if he was willing to give evidence, we thought he'd be here today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Apparently he is willing to testify, but he's not going to testify until he knows the consequences.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> But Mr Chairman, the indulgence I think it gives us sufficient time from today till Tuesday, I think it's sufficient time for us to know exactly what our position is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well you know very well that you won't come on Tuesday and ask for a further indulgence, Mr Webster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> That is my intention, Mr Chairman but please don't hold it to me, there are other considerations of a more persuasive nature but in so far as my intention Mr Chairman is, we proceed on Tuesday because it's also in my interests to finalise the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Webster, as things stand at present.  The committee is about to start a matter just now which is not likely to finish during the course of today and tomorrow and we will be meeting on Monday in the hope that we'll finish it by then.  I want to know whether it's possible for you to give us an indication on Monday whether your witness will be coming on Tuesday or whether you are not going to lead any evidence on Tuesday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I will be in contact with the Leader of the Evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, please make every endeavour so that we know how to arrange the time of people who are involved, counsel who are involved as to whether they have to be here on Tuesday or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> And also if there are people to be called, to supply them with the necessary copies of statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, by Monday if you can tell us, it will facilitate everybody's work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Absolutely.  I agree.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, thank you very much.  Your application , this application is then postponed until Tuesday morning at 9.30 and on the understanding that you will let us know on Monday whether you are proceeding with any further evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, do allow me just to place two matters on the role.  You did not ask me what my position is.  Mr Chairman, the owner of the car if he comes here and tells you that there were bullet holes through the roof, does not of necessity mean that there was a helicopter.  So really that evidence...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just, just don't worry about all that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And Mr Chairman we gave evidence ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The Committee is sufficiently experienced to know how to deal with matters of that kind.  You don't have to worry about that at this stage.  I don't know whether there's going to be the owner of a vehicle or not, whether we are to be confined to hear Mr Breytenbach, so we'll just leave it at that, Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I just wanted to remind you that Gen Steyn did give evidence that he spoke to him and what he told him, Mr Chairman, so there's no chance of my learned friend calling Mr Breytenbach at all, in our submission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, he's making every endeavour in the hope of persuading him.  This matter is adjourned, at your request.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR WEBSTER:</span> As the Commission pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Until tuesday morning.  We will take the short adjournment now and we will resume at 11.15 when we will proceed with the next application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
