<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, the last applicant for whom we appear is W/O Lawrence Gerald Wasserman, whom we call to the stand.  He will give his evidence in English.  We beg leave to hand up to you a summary of his evidence and we would propose that that be marked Exhibit F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That will be so marked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  He has no objection to taking the prescribed oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">LAWRENCE GERALD WASSERMAN:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Please take a seat, Mr Wasserman.  You're an applicant in this incident, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Have you perused Exhibit A?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And do you find yourself in agreement or disagreement with the contents of Exhibit A?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I concur with the contents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you ask that that be incorporated in your evidence, together with references to other evidence which Exhibit A contains, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You have previously given evidence before another Amnesty Committee in the application with regard to Ndwandwe, the KwaMashu 3, and Pumezo Ncgweni, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If you will please turn to page 2, and will you inform the Committee what your knowledge and participation was in the present incident.  You first of all refer to the evidence of Col Vorster.  You have also heard the evidence of Col Botha this morning, in regard to the background of the violence in Natal and the situation in Swaziland, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you also find yourself in agreement with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would you please continue at page 2, paragraph 2, of Exhibit F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>"I was instructed by Col Botha from Durban, to accompany him on an operation to Swaziland.  I was informed by him that there was information to hand that an important Umkhonto weSizwe member, Dion Cele, had indicated that he would be willing to work for the Security Branch.  And our mission would be to abduct Dion Cele from Swaziland, bring him to the RSA and attempt to turn him and recruit him and place him back."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Right.  What did you know about Cele, what were you told?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>MR WASSERMAN</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>"We knew that Dion Cele was a member of border work, attached to the Natal machinery.  He lived in Manzini and he was undergoing night school at Scot, at a technical college in Manzini in Swaziland.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>		And as a border worker he was responsible for the infiltration of MK into Natal and the subsequent movement of weapons with those units and responsible for acts of terror within this province."</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>MR WASSERMAN</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>"I was informed that there was an informer who was handled by Mr Vorster ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Goodwill Sikhakane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Goodwill Sikhakane.  I learnt the name at a later stage.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>"... and he would assist in bringing forward Dion Cele."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Right.  You travelled with Botha from Durban in a kombi, is that correct, to Amsterdam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you go in with Botha and Vorster on the reconnaissance trip?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Before the abduction was performed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Right.  Did you stay behind in Amsterdam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  And then on the next occasion when Swaziland was entered, did you then accompany them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you just tell us about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>MR WASSERMAN</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>"Col Botha and I took the kombi in.  We entered legally, proceeded to Manzini to the George Hotel and there linked up with Sikhakane."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Form there ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did he come, get into the kombi with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And at one stage, was he asked to take over the driving of the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>"He then drove to a spot near the main gates of the Scot, of the technical training college in Manzini."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what did you do, where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>MR WASSERMAN</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>"I and Mr Botha then took up hiding places in the rear of the kombi and we were covered by some large cardboard boxes."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>MR WASSERMAN</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>"Shortly after standing off outside there, Dion Cele came forward and he entered the vehicle by the sliding door."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why not through the passenger door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He couldn't enter through the left-hand door as we had jimmied that lock to make it useless, thereby enforcing him to use the sliding door, giving us the sign that he was indeed in the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Now I may have understood this incorrectly, judging from what Mr Botha says.  You say in paragraph 6</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>"He went to sit on the passenger's seat next to Sikhakane."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>Is that the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I think that is correct position, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So I did understand you correctly.  You differ from Mr Botha, who says that he sat on the seat behind the driver.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I'm not too sure where he was.  I do realise - I then pulled him over once we had moved off.  Sikhakane drove off.  There was no indication from Cele that he was aware of our presence in the vehicle.  I then, and Col Botha, then moved the box and grabbed hold of Cele and pulled him over to where I was, to the rear of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What did he do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He shouted and he kicked and he struggled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I used force.  I smacked, I slapped him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You say you slapped and punched him a few times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And spoke and shouted at him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And afterwards he became quiet when he realised that - I had told him that we're policemen from South Africa, and upon that he relaxed, he then quietened down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well he became quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He became quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Probably didn't relax, but ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well he became quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>MR WASSERMAN</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>"We then returned to the Nerston area.  Sikhakane stayed behind.  Col Botha drove the kombi.  I was still with Mr Cele and we drove out illegally, out of Swaziland."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>MR WASSERMAN</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>"We then continued on to this house next to Amsterdam, where the senior officers made an attempt to - well they started to debrief him and made attempts to recruit him."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you take part in the interrogation or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  So was he willing to be recruited?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you present when there was an attempt to interrogate him or recruit him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not.  No, Sir, not in any form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Right.  Did you the at some point leave Amsterdam and go to a farm in the Elandskop area in the district of Pietermaritzburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In paragraph 10 you say after you arrived on the farm, at some point Col Botha left for Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And he was not present during the remainder of the event?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What happened on the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> On the farm Cols Taylor and Vorster continued in length to try and recruit Mr Cele to come over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you present at that time from time to time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> From time to time, very irregularly, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you gain the impression that Mr Cele was willing to co-operate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was informed by both Taylor and Vorster that he was not prepared to co-operate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Please carry on with paragraph 12.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>MR WASSERMAN</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>"Much much later, Col Taylor informed me that it was virtually impossible for this man to co-operate and I then went in and I had a chat with him.  He then gave me the impression that he would not co-operate.  I slapped him three or four times.  It made no difference whatsoever."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was this a serious assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, it was not serious, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why did you slap him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Up to that stage Mr Taylor and Mr Vorster had been "Mr Nice Guy", in one of the techniques that we use, so I was prepared to see if the raucous shouting and few slaps would create a different environment, but it did not work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  In paragraph 13 you say that Taylor then spoke to you and Vorster and stated that it's clear that Cele was not recruitable, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Continue there please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>MR WASSERMAN</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>"He gave us various reasons.  He did state that if Cele were to be released it would be an embarrassment to the South African Government, as he had been abducted illegally in Swaziland and brought out illegally to the Republic.  That was one of the major reasons."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and could Cele, according to your insight, be released to go back to Swaziland unhindered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He could have - he would have continued with his activities.  In addition, placed Sikhakane in danger, as he would have realised by now that he was an agent of the Security Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  And you say in paragraph 13, Taylor then ordered Vorster and yourself to see to it that Cele be eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you associate yourself with that order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I did, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What did you then do, you and Vorster?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Vorster and I then proceeded to the pine tree plantation where we commenced to dig a grave.  And once we had dug that grave we returned to the house where Mr Taylor was still with Mr Cele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  You remember something when you entered, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.  Once when we'd entered the house, Mr Taylor gave us the sign that Mr Cele was to be now taken outside and to be eliminated and I realised that Mr Cele had not - had decided not to co-operate at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that you had to proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And we had to proceed with the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>MR WASSERMAN</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>"We then informed Mr Cele that he was going to be moved to another safehouse.  We blindfolded him so he could not see where he could go.  His hands were handcuffed behind his back."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now the blindfold you're talking about, Mr Vorster seems to remember a hood made of material of some kind.  What is your recollection, if anything, about the blindfold?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I can't recall if it was a bag or if it was merely a piece of cloth wrapped around the eyes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  What did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>MR WASSERMAN</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>"His hands were cuffed behind his back and we took him outside, outside the house and off the veranda and along the road, he walked along the road to the graveside."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you steer him in the direction which you wanted him to go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>MR WASSERMAN</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>"At the spot right next to the grave I had in my possession a police baton.  I rendered him unconscious with a heavy blow to the head."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why did you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> To render him unconscious, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> For what purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Then I was able to shoot.  So he would not know.</p>

<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>MR WASSERMAN</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>"Once unconscious I shot Mr Cele twice in the head."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> With a silenced makarov.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was this your firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, this makarov had been given to me earlier by Mr Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>MR WASSERMAN</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>"He was then placed in the grave."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And the grave was filled in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Clothing first removed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm sorry yes, you removed his clothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you remember whether you left any of the clothing on the body or whether you took everything off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I seem to recall he was completely naked, but I could be wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, alright.  And then you filled in the grave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We filled in the grave.  After sprinkling some line on the body first, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes. Do you agree with Mr Vorster as to the reasons or the purpose of the lime?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Right, and then what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We then filled in the grave and then proceeded up to the house with the clothing and burnt the clothing to ashes, to cinders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How do you see your participation in this incident as you set it out from paragraph 19 onwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, in doing what I did I saw as my duties as a policemen ...(indistinct) of the Security Branch, and I saw it as relevant to battling the conflict and the political violence that we were undergoing at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We were conditioned by speeches of politicians and directions of our senior officers, to do all that was in our power to confront the revolutionary onslaught at all costs.  And there were times when in terms of the prevailing legislation of the time, it was not possible to solve all the problems that came our way.  And the present case is perhaps an example of such an instance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>	In view of the above, I was in the bona fide belief that what I did in the present instance, in order to combat or derail the revolutionary onset and to protect the government and the National Party from political embarrassment, did fall within my express or implied authorities.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>	I did not participate in these events for any  personal gain and was not driven by any personal spite or malice and I received no reward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You apply at page 1, for amnesty for the abduction or the man stealing - I notice in the Criminal Procedure Act it's two different offences Chairperson, I wasn't aware of that.  I'm not quite certain which is the major offence, although it would appear that abduction might be because under the old Criminal Procedure code, abduction was a capital offence, you could receive the death penalty for that.  But be that as it may, you apply for abduction or man stealing of Mr Dion Cele, his unlawful detention or depravation of his liberty, his murder - yes, I've forgotten Chairperson, I do apologise - for the assault on Mr Cele as you have explained, here in Swaziland as well as on the farm and for - and what I've also neglected to put in in your case is any offence in terms of regulations pertaining to movement, border movements.  Is that correct?  As well as any offence or delict which may be supported by the fact.  Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's so, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, that is the evidence which we wish to place before you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It has just occurred to me that we don't know the date on which this man was abducted.  Can you tell us when that was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, if my memory serves me well it was the 6th of July 1988.  May I just check please, Chairman.  Mr Chairman, can we check that, whether we have a specific date during the lunch hour and inform you when we come back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and likewise the date on which he was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, certainly Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you know the date of one, then you'd know without difficulty ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, certainly.  We will try to establish the exact date if possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And in what language was all this discussion and negotiation with Cele taking place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, when I ever spoke to him it would have been in English, but Mr Taylor spoke in Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did you know that his conversation or his discussion or questioning of Cele was in Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You didn't have the need for an interpreter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, Mr Taylor spoke Zulu fluently, it was - he would have been handling that himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you any questions to ask of this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I've got none.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR NEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Perhaps I could answer your question straight away, Chairperson, before Ms Thabethe starts.  The TRC Report, in volume 2 at page 131, places the date in July 1988.  No closer than that.  But we will still see whether we can find a closer date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I seem to recall having read somewhere "6th of July", Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, well you'll let us know.  Have you any questions, Ms Thabethe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Just a few, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, please do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>	Actually, Mr Wasserman it's one question.  How do you reconcile the evidence of Mr Botha and Vorster, that at no stage was Mr Cele assaulted and your evidence that he was assaulted by yourself in Swaziland and on the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well I never saw either of them ever assault him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think the question clearly is that it seems that they didn't see you assault him.  In other words, there was no evidence of any assault as far as they were concerned, and you</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>have told us that you assaulted.  And I think the question is now, are you in a position to reconcile the difference between your evidence and their evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Oh, now I understand yes, Sir.  The assault in Swaziland, I would hardly even say that was an assault, that was a matter of first of all securing the man there.  Mr Vorster and Mr Botha weren't present in the farmhouse when I assault Dion Cele in the farmhouse.  They were not present, so they would not know, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just for the sake of clarity and for the record, Mr Botha did in fact say in his testimony that he does recall you</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>assaulting the deceased in the car, in the kombi when you were trying to subdue him at that point.  So just for the record, he did say that in fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Do you know what happened to the shell casings when you shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, he would have been in the grave, I would have leant into the grave, I would imagine the "doppies" would have fallen into the grave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But obviously you've no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I have no idea.  Perhaps they were lost in the exhumation, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>	Mr Wasserman, just on the issue of the interrogation.  On a question put to you by the Chairman, you responded that Mr Cele was fluent in Zulu.  What interests me was were the other interrogators fluent in Zulu?  Did he speak Zulu all the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, when I ever spoke to him he spoke to me in English.  I think when Mr Vorster and Mr Botha spoke to him he spoke in English, but when he spoke with Mr Taylor the entire proceedings would have been in Zulu, and they were in Zulu in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you.  Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you very much, you're excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's the appropriate time to take the adjournment.  Mr Visser, we are going to adjourn for 45 minutes, we'll resume at a quarter to two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Mr Chairperson, I wonder if I may ask for an indulgence till 2 o'clock, I have a problem that I have to rush back to the office because police headquarters have queried me and they would like an answer from me with regards to the queries of my further appearances on behalf of Col Taylor, before 3 o'clock this afternoon.  I'm terribly sorry to put the Committee in this position, but I will be back at 2 o'clock if it is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  We will not - you understand that you'll be proceeding on behalf of Col Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Mr Chairperson, the other applications, for instance the Thombi Khubeka matter, was orchestrated by Mr Taylor and in consultation with my learned colleagues here, they have felt and I have - well I have brought it to the police' attention that it might be of assistance if I do appear on his behalf.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well we can't deal with an application for amnesty on behalf of somebody who is deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I realise that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So I think that should eliminate that problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Very well, Mr Chair, I'll be back at quarter to two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you can try, if you can be back at quarter to, we'll resume at a quarter to two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Thank you, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll adjourn.</p>
