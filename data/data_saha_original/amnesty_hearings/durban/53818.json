I must say that I don't want to bore you with long speeches about why we did what we did or why I was doing the work I was doing, but over a long time we were conditioned to the stage where we could actually do things like this, perhaps.\n\tYou must remember that from a very, very early age I was exposed to the violence that was happening in the country.  I can remember at that age of eight, looking out of my bedroom window in Scottsville, Pietermaritzburg and seeing the community hall of Sebantu village burning during unrest and that was the first indication to me that we had a problem here.  \n\tAnd then throughout the years for instance, the propaganda that we were exposed to, but no propaganda could ever teach me that black people were bad, or no propaganda could teach me not to respect and love the nursemaid I had who first taught me Zulu or uBuntu or whatever you'd like to call it.  I realised there was something seriously wrong, but the savage nature of the symptoms of the Nationalist Government, the savage nature of the symptoms, there were so many of them.  I can recall things like the Bashe Bridge murders, I can recall things like the Langa riots, I can recall the Cato Manor riots, I can recall the nun, Dr Mary Quinlan who was killed during township unrests and the mob eating her body which they cooked on her burning car.  Stuff like that left a lasting impression on me and I wanted to fight this.  I realised that black people weren't being treated right, but nothing, but nothing could condone the savagery of those symptoms.\n\tAnyway, to cut it short, if the deceased is who we think he is, then we were fighting on opposing sides, we were fighting a war that was caused by ideologies and fanned by politicians.  I think I was about four months old when the Nationalist Government came to power, I had nothing to do with the formulation of their policies, but I had a lot to do with the symptoms of that rule and as I say, we fought on different sides.  And it has occurred to me that I've been indicated that it's the sister of the deceased who is facing me now and it's just occurred to me that it could be my mother, my sister, my children sitting there now, because what happened to the deceased could quite easily have happened to me.  I was involved in a lot of covert operations both inside and outside.  Nothing, nothing like this I can tell you, but was often in the company of people, being all alone by myself, often in the company of people who thought I was one of them and had they discovered that I was not one of them, it would be my mother sitting there now, Sisi, you must understand that.  \n\tSo I empathise with the family of the deceased, I would be very heartless if I did not do so.

Why would you have said it in the first place?
