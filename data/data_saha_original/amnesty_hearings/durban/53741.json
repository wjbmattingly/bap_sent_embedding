He led me to believe that this would be confined to the Klein issue.  I see that he's traversed on the Why Not aspect and now on the Edendale aspect.  A level of latitude I concede is necessary, but I think this is now getting a little too far.  The Edendale aspect, pertinently to this question, was raised yesterday, answered yesterday.

He says to sum up, he was instructed as late as a few days before the bomb to go ahead with, what I say very specifically a car bomb, at a hotel, as described, the name might not have been mentioned.  It was a specific instruction from him as the High Command of the ANC to carry out that attack and I believe that it is more than appropriate that he, at his level, should now be cross-examined on that aspect and be asked to give us evidence that might have been obtained, had we been able to cross-examine him on matters emanating from the Section 29 information.
