<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, may I call Mr Du Preez to give evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">SALMON JOHANNES GERHARDUS DU PREEZ:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Are you Salmon Johannes Gerhardus du Preez?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you apply for amnesty in the case of Ms Ndwandwe as well as Pumeso Nxiweni and the kwaMashu 3?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You filed an application in terms of the Act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that application appears in volume 2, on page 24 and following.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In your application on page 26, you admitted that your memory about what happened, is vague and that you do not have any documentation or any other information where you could refresh your memory with, and my question is that during this period in which you signed your application, you did receive information from your co-applicants that refreshed your memory concerning the details of this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You then on page 28 at the bottom of the page, referred to the amnesty applications of Steyn, Botha and Forster and you confirmed it in where it is applicable to you, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I do not have a page 28 in front of me Mr Chairperson.  That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You mentioned this in your amnesty application, or about the amnesty application of Ndwandwe, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now concerning Nxiweni, on page 29 you said that you and Sergeant Wasserman eliminated him and buried him in a sugar plantation.  We know that Steyn was not involved in this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is as far as Nxiweni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And then the kwaMashu 3, Steyn was again not involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was it your intention to say that in that incident or to which you referred to in Botha's statement, that you would like this to be added to your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> On the 29th of November 1953 you were born in Pretoria, and you did your schooling or you completed your schooling in 1972 in Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Your father was a member of the South African Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you, yourself, grew up in we can describe it as a police culture?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What were your parents' political and moral viewpoints?  What were your parents like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> They were very conservative and they were both members of the National Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were they also conservative?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, they were conservative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As members of the National Party, and the party to which your parents belonged to, did this influence your viewpoints from childhood?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, certainly so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you see anything wrong in the policy of apartheid that was upheld by the National Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson, I supported this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Directly after school, you joined the South African Police in 1973?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Have you got anything to say about the unrest during that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I was a member of the Special Branch and I also served in the 1976 unrests.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> During that time, what was said to you concerning what your tasks would entail as a member of the Special Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> When I became or joined the Special Task Force, we had to be willing to kill if it was necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, this now specifically refer to what we in general consider as the political struggle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I am sorry Mr Visser, I do not know if I heard you correctly, did you say that you must be willing to kill other people if it is necessary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, to kill people if it is necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was this a general statement or was it said what the circumstances would be?  It is a very broad statement, isn't it, when would it be necessary, did they tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was not specified no, but it was part of the selection, that if you are willing to kill any person, you would not have been selected in this process.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In other words if you were a pacifist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But if you were an ordinary person who in an emergency situation, would kill, then you would succeed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> It had nothing to do with illegal activities, you did not read it like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just to explain this better, this was part of the psychometric test that you did, to find out if you would be suitable for this Special Task Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In your capacity as a member of this Task Force, you came face to face with the realities of the internal warfare that was going on at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.  During that time I also served in the previous South West and I was also applied there as more than just a soldier, we were an Anti-terrorist movement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you in contact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you say how many contacts you had?  Not in numbers, but was it a few?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, it was in more than 10 contacts where various terrorists were killed and also of our own members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where there was firing at both sides?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You refer or I would like to refer the Committee to specifically volume 2, the Exhibit E47 that appeared before the Amnesty Committee, in this case  in volume 2, that is the statement of the Generals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We are not going to read this, but what is your comment on the situation that is explained in paragraph 13 and 14 and 16 concerning your own situation?  Can you identify yourself with this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In 1979 you were placed with the Security Branch in Port Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you referring to page 142?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Page 161 Mr chairman, of volume 2, the involvement of the South African Police in both the former Rhodesia and former South West Africa in a military support role, to the Rhodesian Army and the South African Defence Force, necessitated training them in purely military tactics and techniques.  In neither of these situations, they were expected to act as civil police.  Every contact between them and their opponents, led to a bloody shootout, with the result that ordinary civil police functions fell by the wayside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>	The ordinary policemen drawn from the ranks of the police, from the whole country involved in these guerilla warfare and counter-insurgency activities, where he in fact had to kill or be killed, became progressively more accustomed to this type of conflict and the ways, means and methods utilised in combat the enemy and it goes on Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>	It is those ideas that Mr Du Preez says.  In 1979 you were transferred to Port Natal.  In what section, or I will lead you in this, originally you served in the Church Section.  Was this at the desk of the ANC or what desk was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, there was a Church Section concerning church matters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was completely independent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In the Security Branch or in the ordinary branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, it was in the Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And in 1981 you were transferred to the Terrorist Section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Under Colonel Andy Taylor?  Did you receive any special training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> In the investigation of terrorism?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Are you an explosives expert?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And at that stage, did you investigate certain incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you give a number of the amount of incidents that you visited or investigated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, in that time in Durban, I investigated more than 100 scenes of explosions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And were people killed in those incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What time was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was from 1981, I would say up to 1990 and up to around 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You also became aware of the death of one of your colleagues, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, various of my colleagues died during the period when I was in the Special Branch.  Four of my colleagues died and or were killed by ANC terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Amongst others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Colonel Welman, Zukela, Mike Mbede and Radjo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Is it so that in 1994, May 1994, you were found medically unfit for the task of a policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And at the May of 1995, you were discharged with the rank of Superintendent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was the diagnosis of your state?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was post traumatic stress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What would you say led to this state?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I think it must have been the politics, the things that happened in the police and the situation in the police itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You are now referring to the violence, etc?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As a member of the Security Branch, did you feel that you were busy with normal, legal actions or what was your position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, from 1981 in Durban with the beginning of the bomb explosions, we felt that we were more in a war than in ordinary service as police officers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you feel that you became more and more involved in a political struggle, rather than just crime prevention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> From time to time suggestions were made that members of the Security Branch killed terrorists, MK members indiscriminately, those that they could catch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes. No, it is not true, if it would have been the case, I would have been involved in hundreds of incidents or cases, then this amnesty application would not have been just about a few people, but about hundreds of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would you say that in the incidents where it did occur, would be the exception?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Du Preez, if we can continue and get to the point of the political background in the broader terms and we have listened to the evidence of Mr Botha and Steyn and Forster, do you agree with the general political background?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, I do agree with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you also agree with the political views with which these actions were executed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you involved in the Ramlakan case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In what capacity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I was one of the Investigators, I also took down statements from people in this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You also heard the evidence of Mr Botha in broader terms, about what the Ramlakan case was about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you agree with this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Concerning Ndwandwe, she was discussed or from Mr Botha, she was involved in the Ramlakan case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> At one stage, we know in 1987 she left the country and Mr Botha said according to the information, or your information that you received, she received training and she later went back to Swaziland.  Would that correlate with information that you had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And from Swaziland she operated as the acting Commander of MK operations within the Republic of South Africa, and more specifically in the area of Port Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you know that she was pregnant during 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.  I knew that she had a child later on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I must admit Mr Chairman, I wasn't aware of that information myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Newspaper cuttings that we have been given says she had a one year old child, when she was abducted, which would have meant that she was pregnant in 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Probably.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The child would have been born in about October.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  In any case, you were part of the abduction out of Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you familiar with the planning and the purpose of this operation beforehand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you just tell us when you became aware of this operation and what your knowledge was concerning this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Colonel Botha informed me, I am not sure what his rank was at that stage, it could have been Captain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just refer to him as Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Well Botha informed me that an operation was planned to abduct Ndwandwe out of Swaziland.  He discussed this with me, and we discussed the finer details about how we were going to do this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And among others, was there made use of two people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If I ask you who these people were, I am not asking you their names, I am asking what their status were of these two people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> They were informants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> For how long were they informants of the Security Branch before this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is difficult to say, but I can guess it could have been a year, I am not sure of the time span.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were they askaris?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, negative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were they applied and did you receive information from them in other cases apart from that of Ndwandwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You then heard as you have just said, what the purpose of this operation was, and you then accompanied them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We know who the people were who went with, we do not have to cover that again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Before you continue Mr Visser, the purpose of the operation was the abduction, but you said that you discussed further details with Botha, or he discussed it with you.  Did he tell you what the purpose of the abduction was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> The purpose of the abduction was then to recruit her as an informant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he talk to you or discuss with you about the possibility of success to recruit her as an informant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was discussed Mr Chairperson.  I cannot remember the finer details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you think that the chances are good that she will be able to be recruited as an informant for the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, I thought that it was possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No I am asking you if you think that it would be good, not impossible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, I thought the chances were good.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In other words the chances were better that she would be recruited?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did Botha tell you this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I think that was my own opinion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> At no stage he told you that it would be difficult to recruit her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I do not think in a percentage, I thought that the chances would be good to recruit her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You have heard his evidence, and if I can summarise it correctly, he said that in his mind she must be abducted, that she will be eliminated, except if she could be recruited.  Didn't he put it to you like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that possibility was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No sir, it is not a possibility.  That is the framework in which Botha began this operation.  That is what he said to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>	Not that it is possible that she will be eliminated, but that it would be a possibility and that she could - I think he used the expression, that she could save her own life by becoming an informant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, I knew that if she will not cooperate as an informant, she will be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But the probability was not shared with you, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Not that I can remember of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Your personal view was that it would be worthwhile to abduct her from Swaziland, because there is a possibility that she could have been recruited as an informant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If you did not foresee that possibility and you just wanted to eliminate her, what would you have done then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Then we would have eliminated her in Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can I just ask you on what basis did you make this conclusion, was there something specific?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Before this incident, various other people or persons were recruited in this manner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But there was nothing specific in Ms Ndwandwe's actions that made you think that there is a chance now to recruit her, it was just because of other operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If she had been eliminated in Swaziland, wouldn't there be a danger of a political scandal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, not necessarily.  The ANC eliminated many of their own members in Swaziland, so if she were to be eliminated in Swaziland, fingers could be pointed to the ANC themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But fingers may well be pointed at the South African Security Forces, might they not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Certainly so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Particularly if a fairly large group in three different vehicles had crossed the Swazi border that morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> If it was about the elimination, we would not have used so many personnel or vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  It is also true, is it not, and we know this from the facts, that Ndwandwe during the Ramlakan case, did indeed under Section 29 detention, apparently offer her cooperation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct, she also made a Section 29 statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In either event, as history has taught us, your feeling about this was incorrect, but let us first move into Swaziland.  Is it correct that you moved in three vehicles, Taylor's Nissan, the kombi and a bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You have listened to the evidence which was given by Wasserman and he has stated that you and him were basically together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you agree with his breakdown of how it happened, where you went, first to Onverwacht, then up to Manzini, that you made observation in front of the bakkie, after you had given the bakkie to the two informers on the way to Manzini and that Ndwandwe climbed into the bakkie and that the bakkie moved behind you, you moved ahead.  The vehicle of Taylor, with Taylor, Botha and Forster inside, was driving behind the bakkie, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is it also correct that outside Manzini, Ms Ndwandwe was transferred from the bakkie to the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that you then travelled in the direction of Culel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that you turned then on the Hluti road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And then you stopped after you had travelled that road for a short while, and Botha and Ndwandwe took shelter at the back of the bakkie, under a piece of canvass?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you and Wasserman were in front of the bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you recall that it rained on that evening, as we have heard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.  We drove the bakkie in fourth wheel drive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was a 4 x 4?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When you were in Manzini, can you remember what time you were there, what time of the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We were in Manzini at dusk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In October that would have been approximately what time?  Was it October?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Approximately 6 o'clock, half past six.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  We know that the minibus was driven by Forster away from the border post, and the bakkie was driven out...</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, Wasserman and I drove the bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I beg your pardon, I meant that Botha and Taylor were in Taylor's vehicle and that is how they moved out at the Culel border post?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is it also your recollection of the facts, that the two informers were dropped off and that they crossed the fence illegally to the other side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, I assume that that is how it happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We know that there was a point at the fence, where there was a rendezvous that evening, where Botha and Ndwandwe climbed through the fence to the people who waited on the other side, that would be Steyn, Forster, Botha and Taylor.  Can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What time in the evening was that approximately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I cannot remember.  All that I can remember is the time that we dropped them off and on the way back, we saw that there wouldn't be enough time to go through the gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Which gate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> The Culel border post.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Wasserman and I turned away to Shlangana and drove around that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is that in Wasserman's words, to get to a tar road as soon as possible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you burgle a house that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Are you aware of a burglary and money which was stolen from a house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I heard about that from newspaper reports which I read later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you or Wasserman have anything to do with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you remember at what time you arrived back in Manzini that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, it was early morning.  We arrived in Manzini, we slept in the bakkie for approximately an hour or so, and then we departed back to the Culel border post, in order to cross at about 7 o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When you arrived in Manzini, you were then too late to sleep in a hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The following morning ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I beg your pardon Mr Visser, sorry to interrupt you once again, you would have known that you would arrive in Manzini at such a late hour, why did you drive to Manzini, why didn't you just sleep somewhere near the border post?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Chairperson, we had planned to go to Manzini, and as a result of the road, we didn't think that we were going to be driving for such a long time, and seeing as we were on our way, we decided to continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Well, seeing as you were on the tar road, you could have predicted your time of arrival at Manzini, that would have been easier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct, but we became stuck quite a number of times on the road that we were taking, and we decided not to take that road back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is the road which we are referring to as the Hluti road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And Wasserman has told the Committee that that was very muddy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The following morning you left and you arrived at the Onverwacht police house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> An you remember approximately what time that was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was approximately 7 o'clock when we went through the border post.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you find Ms Ndwandwe there along with Forster, Steyn and Taylor and Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you participate in her interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson, Ms Ndwandwe was put in the kombi and taken back to Pietermaritzburg, that was shortly after our arrival, we hadn't been there for very long.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you enter Swaziland with a legal passport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, it was a false passport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You then departed for Pietermaritzburg, is which vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, just on that point, do you still remember the name under which you left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The name of the passport, the name under which the passport was issued, can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I think it was Du Toit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How many false passports did you have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I only had the one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you think it was Du Toit or do you know it was Du Toit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was Du Toit, I am not entirely certain about the name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In which vehicle did you journey to Pietermaritzburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I drove the kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And were Botha and Ndwandwe in the back of the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Could you hear what the contents of their discussion was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Chairperson, there was a partition which divided the driver from the back of the kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> This kombi, what was it usually used for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was an observation vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But Visagie changed it, we heard that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What were the changes in principle which he brought about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> There were large periscopes and other such apparatus with which to undertake observation, they were mounted into the kombi so that one could make observations of what was outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that was removed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that was removed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The tables and that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You then arrived in Pietermaritzburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you participate in any interrogation of Ndwandwe while you were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I did ask her some questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you assault her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> At no stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was Ndwandwe's attitude regarding the questions which were put to her, did she provide any answers or did she refuse to answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> She gave me answers and regarding the persons in terms of whom I made requests, she gave me the names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Forster yesterday indicated that she was proud of her activities.  What was your impression?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That was not my impression.  The questions which I put to her, were answered very concisely and I never obtained that impression during my interrogation of her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> At a certain stage, Ms Ndwandwe was killed in the district of Elandskop.  Did you have anything to do with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you tell us how it occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I beg your pardon, one more interruption while we are on this point.    You said that she answered very concisely.  Were you trying to see whether or not she would be suitable for recruitment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I did not consider it at that stage, it did not come up in my mind as a consideration.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was that not the primary reason for the abduction, isn't that what you told us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, at that stage of my interrogation of her, I think it had already been decided that she would be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who told you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I deduced that from Mr Botha and Mr Taylor and Mr Steyn's discussion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Which discussion are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was decided, when it was decided that she would not be recruited, it became generally known that she would not be applied as an informer and at that stage Taylor gave Wasserman and I the order to dig the grave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Du Preez, I asked you how you found out and you initially told me that it was from the discussion of three of your colleagues, and later you said that it was generally known.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>	Who told you that the decision had been taken to kill her, where did this come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I can't recall Mr Chairperson, it is something which was left unsaid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I put it to you like this, initially you very clearly told us that you thought that the chances were favourable that she could be an informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>	Your first contact was the interrogation at Pietermaritzburg, direct contact with her in the form of a discussion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You said at that stage you knew she was going to be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> The stage during which I questioned Ndwandwe, was after Botha had completed his interrogation of her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you present during Botha's interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> On what grounds did you know that she was not suitable?  Or in another sense, why didn't you try to formulate your own opinion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, I think Mr Botha was primarily responsible or would have been primarily responsible for the recruitment of this person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>	It was clear that he had not succeeded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why?  Why was it clear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Through Ms Ndwandwe's attitude.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What was her attitude?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, I was not involved with her interrogation until that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I beg your pardon, perhaps you are misunderstanding me.  You have told us that it was clear that Botha had not been successful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>	Then I asked you upon which grounds, and you said on the grounds of her attitude.  Now I would like to know on what grounds it was clear to you that he had not succeeded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> From Botha's attitude.  The fact that Botha said that she cannot be recruited.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When did Botha say this to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I can't recall that Botha specifically said this to me, I deduced this from discussions between Botha, Taylor and Steyn, that she would not be recruited.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Where did you hear those discussions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> At the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you present during the discussions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, I was present at some of the discussions.  Mr Chairperson, these things were not said in one sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Du Preez, let us just discuss this.  I think that you and Commissioner Malan are on two different wave lengths, let me just put it to you like this.  You were interrogating her, for what reason, for what objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I had a dossier which was out of date, and I was looking for names of people who had committed acts of terrorism.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> By the way, now that you mention it, did you obtain any information from her which was of assistance to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you recall today exactly what that was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was about the Radjo case, that was one aspect of the information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Okay.  Did you interrogate her with the purpose of recruiting her as an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Negative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Whose duty was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That was Botha's duty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you said that afterwards there was a discussion between Botha, Steyn and Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Which you heard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you deduced from that discussion that it was Botha's view that she was not recruitable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Later you received an order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> From whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> From Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what did this order entail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was that Wasserman and I were to dig a grave and that we were to eliminate Ndwandwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you then carry out this order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Before we arrived at this point, were there any other people on this farm, on that particular day who interrogated Ndwandwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was that Labuschagne and Verwey?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I can only remember Labuschagne.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I can only remember Labuschagne.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you present during their interrogation, Labuschagne's interrogation of Ndwandwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now we are back at the point where we were a few moments ago, where you were to go and dig the grave.  What happened next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We dug the grave.  Wasserman and I told Ndwandwe told her that we were going to take her away to another place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you tell her where to or did you just tell her that you were taking her elsewhere?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We simply told her that she was being transferred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was she blindfolded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, she was blindfolded and I led her out of the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Wasserman then hit her unconscious with a wooden stick.  We carried her to the grave.  We placed her next to the grave and Wasserman shot her once in the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a>	We then removed her clothing, and placed her inside the grave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just before you continue, let us just take a step back.   Wasserman said something about her being placed half way into the grave, something to that effect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, she was placed in the grave in a skew fashion, her feet were in the grave, but her upper body still emerged.  She was standing half upright in the grave, if I remember correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The sides of the grave, were they diagonal or straight down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I think they were diagonal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you say that Wasserman then shot her and her clothing was removed and she was then placed inside the grave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you remember anything about plastic bags?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Chairperson, Wasserman sprinkled lime over her, there was a bag with lime inside, and we began to close the grave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Before you did that, did you also place the lime bag in the grave with her, the bag in which the lime had come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where did this lime come from, can you perhaps remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, I don't know from where it came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But it was present after Taylor had given you the order to carry out the elimination and the burial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I beg your pardon, where did you see the lime for the first time, at the grave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> At the grave, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You didn't see Wasserman carrying the lime to the grave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, I can't remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you said that you and Wasserman dug the grave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you went together to go and fetch Ms Ndwandwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Any explanation or suspicion as to how the lime arrived at the grave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I cannot say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, one of you must have taken it there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, why Mr Visser?  Why should one of them have taken it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, it had to have arrived there in some manner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, but there were other men there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And there were how many other men there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is where my question is leading to Mr Chairman.  Were any of the others persons that you recall today, near the grave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, at the time of the elimination it was only me and Wasserman, Taylor and Forster who were on the farm.  The other persons had all left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where were Forster and Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> They were inside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And they weren't by the grave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You said that the lime was sprinkled over her, that the bag was left there and then soil was filled into the grave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was anything else placed over the body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Refuse bags were thrown over her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The contents thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> The contents of refuse bags, they were in plastic bags.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was the reason for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> So that if anybody were to dig around there, it would look like a rubbish dump.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, did you know why you had to sprinkle lime on the body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> The purpose for that was to remove any odour for wild animals who might start digging around there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Who told you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I think that it was Mr Taylor who arranged it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> When did he tell you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I can't specifically recall whether or not I asked him about the lime, but after the lime had been sprinkled, it became known to me that it would divert odour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did you get to know about this before sprinkling the lime or after you had sprinkled it, that it would divert the odour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I think afterwards.  I don't know whether or not it really would have worked that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a>	But I did this because Taylor said so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You didn't see the lime there, you didn't see anybody bringing the lime, and you didn't see Wasserman bringing it in.  You assumed that it was him, because the others were never at the grave, didn't you ask him why he had brought this lime to the graveside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Chairperson, as I have already said, the lime which was sprinkled was to remove any odour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, but you said that you heard this from Mr Taylor and you think that it was afterwards.  In afterwards what you are saying is that when you sprinkled it, you already knew that it was to remove odours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct, but I don't know who put the bag there, it could have been Wasserman or Taylor or perhaps even Forster still.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When would Taylor have told you about lime which removes odour if this was before this occurrence, because you didn't know that the lime was going to be there, yet you found it there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then, why would Taylor have discussed lime with you, was there a previous incident in which you had been involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You cannot explain the chronological order to us, you can just tell us that the lime was there, and secondly you didn't know then that it would remove odour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Shortly afterwards, I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you didn't ask Wasserman why the lime was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I can't remember having asked Wasserman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Du Preez, there was indeed a previous incident, however you were not involved in that incident, that was the incident of Deon Cele is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I know about that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But Wasserman indeed had been involved in that case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, I heard that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was Kubeka buried?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Negative Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The first matter in which he applied for amnesty for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Perhaps you should just state the case of Tombi Kubeka, in 1987, was that a case of elimination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Negative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What happened there, just briefly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was the disposal of a body after she had died of natural causes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Natural causes then, so it is the disguising of a body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> After you had filled in the grave, you all left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just to move back a little, with regard to information received, you have heard Botha and the evidence which he gave regarding the information which Ndwandwe provided to him, at Onverwacht and also during the journey to Pietermaritzburg and also possibly thereafter, it doesn't really matter where, but it was with regard to certain incidents which she referred and regarding which she had given information as to who had been responsible for those incidents.  Did you listen to that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And is that in accordance with your recollection at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When Taylor told you that you were to dig the grave and eliminate Ndwandwe, did you regard this as an order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was it an order with which you agreed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you have already stated that you also agree with the evidence of Botha regarding his motivation or the political objective with regard to this action?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that was chiefly about Ndwandwe's activities from Swaziland as manifested in units in the Port Natal area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can we then move over to Pumeso Nxiweni?  Can you just tell us what your share was in that case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> In that case, Mr Botha had an informer who arranged a meeting with Nxiweni and we arrested him at the rendezvous point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That was on the 4th of November 1988 as we understand it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And it was Botha, yourself and Van der Westhuizen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.  We then took him to a safe house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We know that it was at the Kingspark stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You took him to a safe house and then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is where we interrogated him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> With what purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> In order to obtain information from him with regard to terrorist activities in Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Weapon stockpiling points.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> yes, weapon stockpiling points.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you interrogate him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you assault him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> He was assaulted, I assaulted him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In what way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was slapping and punching with a balled fist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> In the face and on the body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And in the face?  As a result of the interrogation, did any information emerge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, information did emerge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We heard from Botha that he, Nxiweni, apparently provided information that on the previous evening an act of terrorism had taken place at the Rosborough station, and it was committed by members of the unit under his command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And on that very same evening, the 5th of November, another explosion was to occur.  Was that the 4th of November, I am sorry, I beg your pardon.  Sorry, it is the 4th of November, another explosion was to take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where would that be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That would be at Montclair, on the railway line at Montclair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What happened as a result of this information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Van der Westhuizen and I drove to the place where he said the bomb would have been placed and on the way there, we received a report that the bomb had indeed exploded and when we arrived on the scene, we did see that it had exploded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were there any police on the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, they were already on the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Pumeso was held overnight at the safe house,is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you remain there or did you go home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I remained there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was any attempt made to recruit him as an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> From your side, that is what I mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, there was no attempt from my side to recruit him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> During further interrogation, more information came to light with regard to armed vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.  He indicated to us that there was a trunk full of arms and ammunition in the suitcase room at the Allan Taylor residence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you go along to the Allan Taylor residence in order to fetch these arms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How did you obtain access to this room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We climbed over the fence, and we went into the room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You opened the door and went in or did you break in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I cannot remember whether the door had been forced open or simply opened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you find anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We found a trunk which fitted the description which Nxiweni had given us, and we found arms inside, we took the trunk and brought it back to the safe house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was it your impression that Nxiweni was recruitable as an informer, judging by what you had observed from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What else happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I beg your pardon Mr Visser, while you are discussing this matter, was it ever said to you that it was a consideration to recruit him as an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We have heard from Botha that in during the afternoon of 5 November, Taylor and Wasserman arrived at the safe house, and that they were informed there by him about Nxiweni's arrest.  Do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was that after their arrival that you went to the Allan Taylor residence to lift the weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Upon your arrival back at the safe house, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can I disturb you for one moment?  This safe house, was this the safe house at Verulam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You have arrived back at the safe house at Verulam, what happened next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Colonel Taylor told Botha and Van der Westhuizen that they could go home and he began to dig a grave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is who, who began to dig a grave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Taylor, he started digging a grave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He didn't ask anybody else to do it, he did it himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you provide any reason why he did this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I beg your pardon, nobody offered to assist him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Wasserman and I helped him later with the digging of the grave.  When we arrived there, Taylor had already begun to dig the grave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And when you started helping him, did he withdraw?  Surely it wouldn't have been all three of you digging the grave at the same time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> He was there throughout the time that the grave was being dug.  We took turns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> During this stage of the grave being dug, were Botha and Van der Westhuizen still there, or had they already left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now you have dug the grave, what happened next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Taylor told Wasserman and I to eliminate Nxiweni.  He and I took Nxiweni out of the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you say anything to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We told him the same thing, we told him that we were taking him to another place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was that during day time or night time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> He was blindfolded, and we walked with him until the grave.  There I shot him in the head with a Scorpion pistol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was this pistol legally in your possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson, it was a Russian Scorpion pistol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where did he stand, or did he sit or lay down when you shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> He was standing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where were  you standing when you shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I stood right next to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> On his left or right side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> On his left side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was the pistol held near or far from his body when you shot him against his head, so indeed he was shot through the head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was he dead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> He died instantaneously.  He fell down, we removed his clothing and placed him in the hole and closed the hole.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was he buried in the same fashion as Ndwandwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you also sprinkle lime over him, can you remember anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I cannot remember it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you remember if rubbish was also thrown into the grave in that case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, we didn't put any rubbish into the grave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I notice that it is 1 o'clock, I am just about finished with this incident, if I may proceed a little while longer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>	What happened with the clothing?  I think you already said that his clothing had been removed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct, we burnt the clothing afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And then you departed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just with regard to this aspect, Mr Taylor says in his amnesty application, that Nxiweni went along to point out the DLB at the Allan Taylor residence.  Is this in accordance with your recollection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I cannot recall that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And he also says that Botha was present when Pumeso was killed, can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No one else was there.  By the time we killed Pumeso, Taylor had left the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, that concludes this incident, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Just one final question, or regarding your final answer, you said at the time of your shooting Nxiweni, Taylor was no longer on the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How much time elapsed between digging the grave and the elimination?  What did you do after you dug the grave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I think Taylor told us after the grave had been dug, that the decision was taken to eliminate him, and when we went to fetch Nxiweni to eliminate him, Taylor drove away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a>	That is when we went in to go and fetch him, that is when Taylor left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Are you certain of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is how I remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why would he have departed, he helped to dig the grave completely, he stayed there, you took turns, then you go and fetch Nxiweni 60 metres away from where he is about to be buried, and during that time, Botha or Taylor at least left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Nxiweni was not fetched directly after the grave had been dug.  After the grave had been completed, as far as I can remember, we first cleaned up.  We wouldn't have walked in to the room where Nxiweni was with soiled feet and tell him that we were taking him away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you also wouldn't have left the farm without cleaning yourselves up, so in other words you would have cleaned up twice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I can remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why do you say that you wouldn't have, your choice of words looks like construction rather than recollection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Chairperson, I think it may be a construction, but there is no way that one would have gone to the person or left the farm with soil on one's shoes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a>	I can't remember specifically that I had a bath before I left the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Wouldn't Taylor have taken a bath before leaving the farm?  If he were to work with these constructions, because he helped to dig the grave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you would all go and clean up first, and then take Nxiweni out for the elimination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> While you were walking to the grave with him, Taylor climbed into his car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> What I can remember is that Taylor was not on the farm, that he had already left when we eliminated Nxiweni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, just in that regard, if you will allow me just a last reference.  In volume 2, page 63, the words that stand here coming from Taylor, are in my submission significant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a>	He says, I will read the last bit of that paragraph at page 63 Mr Chairman, he says I cannot remember today who actually pulled the trigger.  It wasn't me, but I admit I was part of the decision to kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a>	Then Mr Chairman, he says, I do recall that myself and Colonel Botha were definitely present.  It may be that Sam Du Preez and Laurie Wasserman were also present, but I cannot remember whether any other members were indeed present when this incident took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a>	We have the two people here that were actually instrumental in the elimination.  Mr Taylor couldn't remember whether they were there, with respect Mr Chairman.  I just point this out to say that the evidence of Mr Taylor must be regarded in the light of what Mr Wasserman said, and Mr Botha said about his recollection at the time when he completed these documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a>	I just wanted to make that point at this stage.  There are conflicts Mr Chairman, clearly, there are conflicts in recollection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Visser, I just don't understand the argument with regard to Taylor's absence or departure.  In order to case light on this issue, because in terms of the evidence we cannot rely on the fact that Taylor had departed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a>	When he made this statement, he was in a condition which meant that he could not really stand in for that statement.   But you say Mr Du Preez, that your recollection is that Taylor departed before Nxiweni was eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will now adjourn until 2 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">SALMON JOHANNES GERHARDUS DU PREEZ:</span> (still under oath)</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> (continued)  Mr Du Preez, we've got now the third and last incident, and that is the case which was referred to as the kwaMashu unit to which these people belonged to.  After the elimination of Pumeso, we have heard that members of the Security Branch succeeded with the help of informers to make contact with the members of the kwaMashu unit, are you aware of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Apparently these informants took them into their confidence and agreed with them, that a meeting will take place, it seems to me, at a certain place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> On the 17th of November 1988,  a report was received from informants and members of the Security Branch then went to the Avoca Bridge between Durban and kwaMashu, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you one of the members of that team?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, it was myself, Botha and Wasserman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You found people there or met up with people there.  How many were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was it the three that I have just mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How many people did you expect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We expected four.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were they then arrested or whatever you want to call it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct, we took them to the house of safety.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Which house is this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It is the house is Verulam where Taylor waited for us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were they then interrogated there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did they have anything with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, they had a carrier bag with limpet mines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How many?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Limpet mines?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> During interrogation, did they give an explanation for the reason why they had these mines?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, they did give an explanation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That someone dropped it off at their homes, and that they were going to get rid of it at some place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did they tell what happened to this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> This person then left to Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You knew better, because of the informants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And in the interrogation, what you heard - what happened afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We interrogated the three persons to who the other member was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you then try to find out if they had any other weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were there any results?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> They gave us the name of the fourth person who went to Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you remember that name today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was Naya Ngema.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you attack them, assault them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In the same manner that you did, or was it different, to Nxiweni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, it was the same way that we assaulted them.  We slapped them and hit them with a fist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, just before you get to the assault.  Did you say that they told you that the fourth person who did not arrive there, went to Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.  With later interrogation, it was not during the arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did they say to you that the fourth person was the person who gave them the limpet mines or that it was an unknown person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Their initial lie was that it would have been another person, and not the person who went to Swaziland and that they did not know him, but it was a lie, and we knew that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How did you know this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We knew who the group was and who the members of this group was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How did you know that Ngema did not go to Swaziland if he was then the fourth person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I am sorry, I do not understand your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When your evidence was led, you said that they told you that the fourth person went to Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, when they made that allegation, they said that it was a person who went to Swaziland, who left the weapons with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a>	At that stage they did not say it was the fourth person of their group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you, it is more clear now.  Excuse me, did you ask any questions with regards to the absence of this fourth person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We expected four to arrive at the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you knew that it would be Ngema?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you ask them questions about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And what did they answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> They admitted at a later stage that it was Ngema and they said that he went to Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In other words he went to Swaziland as well as the person who left the weapons with them, went to Swaziland, was that their story?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Well, then I do not understand who went to Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Ngema went to Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And the person who left the limpet mines with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It would also be Ngema?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did they say so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Initially they said, or they said that they did not know Ngema.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you know that he did not go to Swaziland, is that what you are saying to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We did not know at that stage that he went to Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Well, then I do not understand Mr Visser's question that you knew better.  Maybe Mr Visser can just explain this to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Commissioner, it was about the fact that they told a story that an unknown person left the limpet mines with them, and that they were on the way to get rid of them.  That is what they knew better, they knew that they were on their way to go and place the limpet mines as a group or a unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> They firstly referred to an unknown person, and that this person went to Swaziland if I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And afterwards it seems that the fourth person was Ngema and that he possibly also went to Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that he indeed went to Swaziland and that he was part of their group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But you did not know at that stage if he did go to Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, we did not know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> During the questioning, did they agree that they would show where the target would be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And the members who were present there, the four, Taylor, Botha, yourself and Wasserman, did you then take a decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was the decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We decided that we are going to eliminate them at the place or the spot that they wanted to target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What are you going to do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We will then get rid of the bodies with explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The people then went to the railway line in the Phoenix area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What happened there at the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We took the explosives out of the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I wonder Mr Visser, if you can just ask him, he has heard the evidence, if maybe he can add anything else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It would be in order yes.  The evidence from here on would be the same as Mr Wasserman's.  I would just like to deal with it short.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a>	The three people were then taken to a place at the railway where with the nod of Botha, they were killed or shot by your group.  After the first shot was fired, do you know if any other shots were fired after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I fired two shots at the person who was in front of me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Afterwards, did you then prime the limpet mines?</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And the bodies were then placed on the limpet mines, with the hands and heads on them and you then left there and afterwards you heard the explosion of the limpet mines going off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you agree with the decision that they had to be eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was the reason for this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> There was no possibility to recruit them as informants because they were three together, and also because they were responsible for most or various explosions in the Durban area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you consider them as dangerous?</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, they were dangerous terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you think that they had more explosives or ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, I thought that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NEL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, Christo Nel.  Mr Du Preez, just a few questions about late Colonel Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a>	Do you agree with me, I think especially the applicants here, you would be the one who would have known Taylor the best?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, I knew him very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> You worked with him longer than the others at the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Is it correct that late Bobby Welman who were also an explosives expert, was in charge of Taylor and were also very close to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And the late Mike Mbede worked under Taylor's command as one of his men?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Would you say that Colonel Taylor's political viewpoints would be the same as yourself and the others here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And it is also so that in the last few months of Taylor's life, and also in the application that he submitted, you had a lot of contact with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, I did liaise with him regularly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> What was your impression concerning the memories he had, or information that he had, if you discussed it with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Well, Taylor could not remember a lot of things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> If you look at Taylor's application, he says at one stage that he helped with the digging of the grave on Ndwandwe.  Can you comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Would you say that it is a mistake that he made because of his bad memory?</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, it was a mistake that he made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOLTE:</span> Mr Chairman, no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NOLTE</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Du Preez, before you could go to Swaziland, was there any decision that Ms Ndwandwe would be killed if she didn't cooperate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I cannot remember such a pertinent decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Was there any practise prior to your going to Swaziland that any person who didn't cooperate to become an informer, would be killed as a matter of course?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Was there a decision at any stage that any person who did not want to cooperate as an informer, would be killed, that was taken in your presence and perhaps with your participation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> At any time, the time I spent at the Security Branch or are you talking about Ndwandwe specifically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes, the time you spent at the Security Branch, was it ever taken as a principle that anyone who didn't cooperate with you, would be eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairman, each case was dealt with on its own merit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> So when you went to Swaziland for the kidnap of Ndwandwe, your aim was to kidnap her and convert her to be an informer, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And did you discuss when and where you were going to do this, to convert her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, we did discuss it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Where was that process going to be done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you gain the impression that she was going to be brought back into South Africa, and then be converted in the offices maybe of C.R. Swart or in Maritzburg, or what was your impression?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, the plan was very clear.  We would take her to a house of safety at the border post, and from there, we would go to Pietermaritzburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> So when you left South Africa, your plan was clear, kidnap her from Swaziland, bring her to the border post and then take her to Pietermaritzburg, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> There was no plan that she would be taken to the border post, converted and brought back to Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> If she were recruited as an informant, it would have been the process, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> What would be the purpose of bringing her to Maritzburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, if she were to be recruited, we would have sent her back to Swaziland.  If we did not recruit her, we would have taken her to Pietermaritzburg.  That was the plan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> So your evidence earlier on that you didn't, you can't recall where she was going to be converted as an informer, is incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I am not sure what your question is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> I heard your evidence as being that you can't recall where the process of converting her was going to take place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, we would have tried to recruit her after the abduction in Swaziland or during the abduction in Swaziland.  How long this process would take, we could not have decided that beforehand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> When she was taken the following day from the border post to Maritzburg, what was created in your mind, what did you think was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, at that stage I haven't seen or did not know a lot about Ndwandwe, I did not form an opinion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You were just happy about taking her to Pietermaritzburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.  At that stage Steyn, Botha and Taylor in control.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you enquire why she was being taken to Maritzburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was part of the plan, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Well, did you enquire why she was being taken to Maritzburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If I understand you correctly, then the plan or part of the plan was to take her to Pietermaritzburg and that was for the elimination, because if you were to turn her, according to your evidence, you would take her back across the border.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a>	I think the question is really when Pietermaritzburg came in, was it part of the implementation or the decision on the basis that she will not be recruited and that she must be eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, at this stage I cannot say when it became clear to me.  I think it only became clear tome that afternoon in Pietermaritzburg, that she will be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Du Preez, Mr Ngubane asked you what was the plan and you then explained the plan concerning taking her across the border, and if she is not recruited, her elimination, and when he asked you if this was the decision, you then said no, if she cooperated, she would have been taken immediately across the border, back into Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In other words it would have been another plan that you would have implemented, is that not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The question is, the execution of the plan where she will not be taken back, but will be taken to Pietermaritzburg, must that then be seen as a confirmation of an execution of the first plan, the moment when she was taken to Pietermaritzburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you.  I won't pursue with that point.  Why did you have to use a false passport to go to Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I had a false passport and I usually used it when I went to Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes, why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> To cover up the activities of the Security Branch, so that other people cannot see that we are operating there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Well, if you say other people, who do you  mean?  Who was going to get into these affairs and know that you are the Security people who are doing dirty works?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I am not sure what you mean with dirty works?</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Well, you could have used your ordinary passport, go to Swaziland and come back.  I still don't follow the reason why you had to use a false passport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, we worked with informants and a lot of the work we did, was undercover.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you travel in false number plates, registration plates?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I did, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> The vehicles that you used when you abducted Ndwandwe, did they have false registration number plates?</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, they did have false number plates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you did that for the purposes of cover up, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Coming to the question of a baby, you say that you were not aware that she was breastfeeding, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did she at any stage complain to you that she had left a baby for quite some time and she wanted to see the baby?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> She did mention that she had a child, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And was it in the presence of Mr Botha when she mentioned this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I cannot remember if Botha was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> At what stage did she mention that she had a baby, in Maritzburg or the border?</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, I knew she had a child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Well, I know that you knew that she had a child, but you say that she mentioned that.  All that I want to know is was it in Maritzburg or at the border when she mentioned it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Under what circumstances did she mentioned to you that she had a baby?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I cannot remember it Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Was she crying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> She never cried in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did she say that she had a baby and she was longing for the baby?</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, during that time she mentioned to me that she had a child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes, did she say she was longing for the child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did she plead with you not to kill her because she had a small baby?</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Was there any stage before she could be killed, when you gained the impression that she was aware that she was going to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> When you blindfolded her, did she cry, scream?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Was she talking when you blindfolded her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did she complain and say why are you blindfolding me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, we gave an explanation why we were blindfolding her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And she was happy with your explanation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> What explanation did you give her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I cannot hear, can you repeat please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He did not hear that last question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> The question was what explanation did you give and the answer was that he can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The answer was he did not hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Okay.  All right, you have heard the question, can you give me an answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can I just know what the question is, because I am confused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> When you blindfolded her, you said that you gave her an explanation why you were blindfolding her, and my question was what explanation was that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We told her that we are going to take her to another place, or transfer her to another place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And she was happy about that, as far as you could, did she ask you what place it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.  No, she didn't ask any questions.  She accepted it like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And when you transferred her, before you could shoot her, did anyone tell you to shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> When the order was given to shoot her, was it given at the house or at the spot when she was actually shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I have already testified that Colonel Taylor told us that we must eliminate Ndwandwe, he did not give any prescriptions on how to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Was it at the house or at the spot where the shooting took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> At the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And was it in the presence of Ndwandwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Negative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Let's turn to the incident of Nxiweni.  You say that he was involved in the Ramlakan case, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And some of the people that were arrested in connection with that case, they were promised that they would be made State witnesses, they made statements in terms of Section 29, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Were those people that made statements in terms of Section 29, Umkhonto We Sizwe people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And did you influence them by assaulting them, so that they could make these statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you attempt to influence Nxiweni to turn into a State witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I didn't work with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Well, how did you know that there was no attempt to turn him into a State witness, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Could you please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Do you know whether there was an attempt to turn him into a State witness, if I may make myself clearer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, I wasn't aware of any such attempt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But your investigations, was it not the plan to make the case as strong as possible against the main actors, Ramlakan and Duduzile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Chairperson, I was one of the interrogators and I questioned one of the persons, by name of Robert Mlanzi.  I was not in control of those that Mr Taylor had to do with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But you accept it as a fact that Mr Nxiweni did not offer to be a State witness, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As he said, he said he doesn't know.  He doesn't know if an attempt was made to get him.  The first question you asked him was if he did it, and he said no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes, if I may just put it the other way.  Do you accept it as a fact that according to your knowledge, no Section statement that you are aware of, was taken from Mr Nxiweni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I am not aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Do you know how much time they spent in prison before the trial could be heard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I suspect approximately one year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Do you agree with me that if there was an attempt to make him a State witness, a period of one year could have been enough inducement for him to turn into a State witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I cannot comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And when he was arrested, just immediately before he could be killed, that is the second arrest now, were you present when he was interrogated for the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you meet him on the very first day that he was arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> For the second time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> For the second time, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And approximately when did you come into contact with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> When he was arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes, that is for the second time now, that is the second incident, forget about the Ramlakan incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was in the late afternoon that he was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes, well when you came into contact with him, approximately at what hour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Late afternoon, 6 o'clock approximately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Were you involved in the immediate interrogation of him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> From 6 o'clock until when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was from 6 o'clock until late at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> All right.  Did he give you information during that period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, he gave us information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> That is after you had assaulted him as you have indicated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> The following day, did you also participate in his interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you assault him on the following day again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I cannot recall that he was assaulted on the following day as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But did he give you information on the following day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, he did.  He did provide information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> If you can recall, how many incidents did he talk about during the interrogation the previous day and the following day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Chairperson, he told us about him and his unit, which places they had bombed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a>	I don't know, do you want me to mention specific things, I can refer you to Exhibit 88.  I think amongst other things, there was the Montclair railway line, the Rosborough railway station, offices, court offices which they had bombed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a>	I might be able to mention more if I could peruse Exhibit A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Okay, not a problem.  But do you confirm the evidence of Mr Botha that on the following day, he was interrogated the whole day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, he was interrogated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Well sir, these incidents that you have mentioned, I suggest to you that they are not so lengthy as to necessitate a period of more than 12 hours of interrogation, do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Chairperson, we did not only interrogate him regarding the explosions, he was interrogated regarding other matters as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Which matters are you referring to now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Regarding other activities, other divisions which were under his command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes, even those, I suggest to you they could not have necessitated this length of time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Chairperson, this interrogation was not continuous throughout the day.  There were times when we took breaks and there were times when we went over things that he had told us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Is it not the position that this interrogation was not as mild as you have put it to us, this man was severely assaulted before he could give you any information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Chairperson, he was assaulted as I have described.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Had you discussed with Mr Botha that this man would just be given a few slaps and a punch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I did not discuss that with Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> I am just surprised by the similarity of the pattern.  Mr Botha assaults this man, he gives him a few slaps and punches and you also do the same thing.  Was it a coincidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Chairperson, this man was questioned, and if we were not satisfied with his responses, he was assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> How many times approximately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I can't recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> It could have been 10 times, 20 times, because you cannot recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is possible, I can't recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Ngubane, if you will just allow me - Mr Du Preez, this so-called question and answer method, I would like to have more information regarding this, because it is something that the other applicants have mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a>	This question/answer method incorporated assault, that if there wasn't any cooperation, the person would be slapped and hit with a fist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> One of the things on everybody's conscience would be, the degree of severity of these assaults, these slappings and fist blows.  Regarding fist blows, he was hit in the face and on the body, I think you also gave evidence which was similar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was he injured, did he bleed at any place on his body as a result of being hit with a fist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I can't remember that Pumeso was bleeding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Could his nose have broken as a result of the fist blows, could one have broken a rib, what was the violence with which he was struck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a>	These are the questions which are being put consistently, what was the degree of assault which would make a man talk?  Can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, he was assaulted as I have said.  I can't remember that there was any blood running from his nose or his mouth for example and I am very certain that there were no fractures, such as broken ribs or arms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you.  As far as you were aware, before Nxiweni could be arrested, was there any intention of turning him into an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson, not according to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> If I understood your evidence correctly when you were being led, you said that there was no chance that this man could be turned into an informer and he was eliminated, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Chairperson, it was clear from two years previously that he had been busy with bombings, and it was not his intention to seize his terrorist activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes, my understanding of your evidence is that you interrogated this man, and you realised that he could not be turned into an informer.  To me it sounded as if it was a realisation of that particular moment, was I correct in my understanding of your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> So you were going to eliminate him any way, without even attempting to turn him into an informer?  Was that your plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That was the plan Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You wanted to squeeze him of all the information and then kill him just like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Was it ever in your mind, that he should be prosecuted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I think that we had learnt from previous experience.</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes, what previous experience and what had you learnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> When Pumeso was formerly charged and found not guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> So, after the Ramlakan case, is it your suggestion that you decided that if we catch this man, we must just eliminate him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> At what stage did you then because of the Ramlakan experience, decide that this man should be eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> After we had become aware that he had once again become involved in bomb explosions and continued with his acts of terrorism.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Immediately after the Ramlakan case, did it ever occur to you that this man has escaped and he is going to continue with his terrorist as you put it, activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It did not come to my attention then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You thought that he was a changed man after the acquittal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I did not give that a thought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You didn't think about him at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I can't recall whether I thought about him specifically.  There were many persons involved in that case who got away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Okay, the kwaMashu 3 incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I beg our pardon Mr Ngubane.  Nxiweni and Bhila were the only two who got away on a specific date before the others, isn't that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So there weren't many others who got away with him, it was only those two?</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> In the court case there were also other persons who got away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I don't have the records in front of me, but according to the judgment it was much later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I think Buthelezi was much earlier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Buthelezi was earlier if I recall correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Weren't Nxiweni and Bhila let go at the end of the State's case on the basis that there was absolutely no evidence brought in against them, that is the reflection of the record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Well, then the others would not have been set free, the hearing continued, and the question is when he was released, when he got away from the case from which you say you have learnt things out of previous experience, did you then think of him as someone who would continue with his activities, and your answer was then, but there were many other people, it wasn't only him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a>	But there were actually only those two people.  So, I am just asking you this question again, did you ever consider when Bhila and Nxiweni were released, that the risk would arise that they would continue with their activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was a possibility.  I did consider that possibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it also true that there were many others who had not been charged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> And also not caught.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you.  The kwaMashu 3 incident, before I put any questions to you, I have been requested by Mr Filikazi to enquire from you whether you can point to him a spot where these people were killed, so that they can do some traditional rights on that spot.  Are you in a position to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Chairperson, my evidence was that all of them were shot in the back of the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> No, I mean the scene where they were shot, are you in a position to point that out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> The scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, the Investigation Unit knows exactly where the spot is, it has been pointed out by the witnesses to him.  There is no problem in them finding it through the Investigation Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This is the kwaMashu 3.  There are numerous.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We all know where it is, well, except myself, I haven't been there, but there is no problem in finding out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Then that satisfies us Mr Chairman.  When you had information about the activities of the kwaMashu 3, especially about the bombing they were about to execute, when did you hear about that?  You personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I myself?  Botha contacted me and told me that the informer had arranged a meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> I take it that Botha requested you to come with him, to prevent that bombing to take place, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You wanted to add something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Botha called me to come and help him with the arrest of the four that we suspected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> So as far as you were aware, the plan was to go and arrest these people, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That was initially, when Botha contacted me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, in other words, the number of people who were expected to come, there were four people expected to come on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Do you know if that would also include Naya Ngema?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It would have been him as well, he was supposed to be with the group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> He was also expected to come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But to make everything clear once more, is it correct that it is not your evidence that Naya Ngema was the person that gave you information about these people, he was one of the people that you intended to arrest, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Before you could go to arrest these people, was there a meeting amongst all of you that eventually went there, to discuss the plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I can't recall where we all came together.  Botha contacted me and Wasserman and told us to come along.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a>	I don't know where we rendezvoused before the time, but we moved together or congregated and then moved to Avoca Bridge where the other four would arrive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> With the purpose of arresting these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Arresting, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you intercepted these people, and you put certain questions to them, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But you knew all that they were going to do, is that right?  You had information about what they were going to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Why was it necessary to enquire from them about their activities, if you knew what they were going to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Chairperson, if you arrest someone, you would obviously ask them what they were doing.  Even though you know who the person was, you would ask their name and ask them where they were on their way to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And they told you a lie and you decided to assault them, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Well, what made you decide to assault them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, we arrested them and took them to the safe house at Verulam, where we began to interrogate them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a>	It was during this process that they were assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> When you interrogated them, well, I understood you as saying that when you asked them about this incident they were going to be involved in, they told you a lie and you gave them a few slaps because you realised that they were telling a lie.  Was that not your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, that was when they were arrested.  At the house, they tried to repeat this story when we asked for an explanation as to what they were busy doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And they told you a lie before you could assault them, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you assaulted them in order for them to repeat what you already knew, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We assaulted them so that they would produce the true story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes, well, if you knew about this story, was it not out of spite that you assaulted them?  What more did you want them to tell you, because you knew the story?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Chairperson, it was a test for other questions which we were going to put to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you hadn't put those questions to them to see whether they were going to tell you some information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We did put other questions to them, upon which they did provide us with answers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Was it before you could assault them, that you asked them about the other incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Could you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> About the other incidents that you asked them about, did you ask them before you could assault them, or after you had assaulted them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We interrogated them, and if they were telling lies, according to what we suspected to be lies, we would assault them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> So this process of assaulting them, was an ongoing process, if they told you something that you felt was a lie, you kept on assaulting them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> For how long did this process take place?  Was it a day or six hours, ten hours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was approximately four to five hours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Can you recall, the question has been put whether they bled at any stage, can you recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I can't recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> When was the decision taken to eliminate them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> This decision was made on the farm, at the safe house, after they had been arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> It was taken at the farm, was it after the interrogation or during the interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I think that this was during the interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> They were giving you information, why decide to eliminate them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Chairperson, we were of the opinion that all three of them could not be recruited or charged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Why couldn't you charge them, you had found them in possession of instruments in terms of the law, which were illegal to possess.  You had direct evidence that these people had been found in possession of these instruments.  What prevented you from charging them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I think that the decision had already been taken to eliminate them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Well, you have told us that the decision was taken there at the house.  Now if you say that you think that it had been taken to eliminate them, what makes you say so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Perhaps I may be wrong, the decision had been taken to eliminate them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Are you sure about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I think the ultimate is indicative thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> No, are you sure about the fact that when you came to the house and interrogated these people, the decision had been taken to eliminate them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Assuming that the decision had been taken that they would be eliminated, before you could go to the house, was there a decision taken at the house again, to eliminate them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, with respect to my learned friend, he is confusing not only the witness, but even myself.  The witness has made it quite clear that the decision to eliminate them, was taken after they had arrived at the safe house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a>	My learned friend is now juggling it around to when you arrived at the house, or on the proposition that before you arrived at the house, none of which was the witness' evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He is now agreeing with it Mr Visser.  As I understand it, your witness has just agreed that the decision had been taken by the time they came to the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is precisely my point Mr Chairman, it is because of the confusion that is created by the question.  He is being misled into answering questions which is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think he is being misled, I think he is being pushed along, and he is agreeing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Mr Du Preez, can we get an answer, the question was at the house, was there a stage when it was agreed again that these people should be eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, after these arrests of these persons, when we arrived at the house, we had decided that they were to be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Mr Du Preez, I am going to put it to you that the conflict in your answer is a clear indication that you are not making a full disclosure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a>	You are trying to create a story that should agree with the other applicants, who have told fabricated stories before this Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Mr Chairperson, I am not certain what Mr Ngubane is driving at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I am watching you and I am watching the questioning.  I don't know if you should listen to the interpretation, if there is one available, because I am not certain whether or not you are following the intonation of all the questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a>	Mr Ngubane, will you proceed, we will see if helps a little if the interpretation assists him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you.  I am putting to you sir, that you are telling this story differently because you are not coming out clean on what happened.  You are trying to tailor your evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Could you repeat please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> I am putting to you that you are contradicting yourself precisely because you are not coming out clean as to what happened regarding this incident.  You are tailoring your evidence to agree with the story of the other applicants, which also is fabricated, which is not a full disclosure of what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is not true Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> I am putting it to you that you killed these people out of spite, there was no reason why you should kill them, the kwaMashu 3?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NGUBANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV PRIOR:</span> I have a few aspects, thank you.  Mr Du Preez, in the case of terrorists who were caught with weapons, what was the possibilities except for the elimination or killing of them, you could have detained them, is that not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was not a decision in this case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> No, I am talking now in general.  You could have detained them, is that not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> In terms of Section 29 or any other Section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is a possibility, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> For how long before you charged them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I cannot remember at that stage, what it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was it months, weeks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I think 30 days maybe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And you could get a new certificate and still detain that person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, it wasn't very easy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And the fact that they were in possession of limpet mines, you could successfully charge them?  There were direct evidence against them, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Not what I believed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Let us leave the decision to eliminate them out of this.  You could if you wanted to, charge them under whatever legislation and continue with a successful prosecution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> At that stage I did not think that it would be the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You found three limpet mines in a carrier bag, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You said that you did not trust that evidence.  I am talking in general, Mr Du Preez, it is not a trick question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a>	If they were charged, would they have been found guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Possibly yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And at least five years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And effectively would be taken out of circulation through this method, on the basis of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Exactly the same with Nxiweni, he was found with weapons and explosives in a trunk in his house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is it not the case that the decision was made a long time before they were arrested, and that is to kill them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> With the release of Nxiweni and Bhila in 1987, according to the amnesty application of Mr Rosslee, bundle 1, Mr Rosslee put it as follows, page 24 of that bundle, although it is being denied, but I am going to question you about this and present you with a probability.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a>	We Mr Wasserman of the local Security Branch.  He told us that two of the accused in the Toti bomb blast criminal trial, had been acquitted, but was still continuing their subversive  actions, that our task was to arrest them for purposes of elimination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a>	We know that that reference there is about a period after the Ramlakan case and the release of Bhila and Nxiweni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I would like to put it to you and it seems out of Rosslee's initial application, that at that stage in 1987, a decision was made to those who were referred to wrongly in the Toti case, was the Ramlakan incident, and that they had to be killed at that stage, will you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, I heard that in evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was that the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, I cannot comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> The name Pindele Mfeti, is it known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> The questions that I put to your colleagues, you heard it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Have you got any comment or can you maybe assist us in that regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is it possible that you at one stage in April 1987 rather than Nxiweni, abducted the wrong person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why do you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Because I did not pick a man up before that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, I do not think that they refer to you, they refer to the unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, I do not know about a person that was picked up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The question was is it a possibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I do not think that it is possible, that a person would be wrongly abducted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you have any knowledge of Bhila's abduction and elimination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why is it not possible that you would not have any knowledge of that attempt to eliminate Nxiweni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I have not heard anything like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you haven't heard about Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Is it possible that there was such an attempt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, it is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Is it possible that the wrong person was picked up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> During the Ramlakan hearing and also the investigation thereof, mention was made of a Taylor unit, the Allan Taylor unit, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> During Ramlakan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes, Nxiweni had ties with that unit, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Can you remember who else were members of that unit, that is now during the Ramlakan hearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I remember that there was a person named Chichanzi and I cannot remember the other person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was there another person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, there was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Do you agree that that unit broke away after the arrests, or disbanded completely, they did not exist, because of the Ramlakan charges?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And that was also the information that you had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> The whole organisation was infiltrated to such an manner as we heard and that the information received, was of good quality?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> In 1988, what was the information that you had concerning the Allan Taylor unit?  Did it still exist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> At that stage Nxiweni, there were two other members with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Who were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I tried to remember their names.  I did know their names Mr Chairperson, but I cannot remember at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> They were not your informants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> What happened to them according to the information that you have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> The two people were taken back by bus to the Transkei after Pumeso's elimination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Just a moment Mr Chairperson.  Mr Chairman, may I place something on record, to correct a statement of fact that was put to, I think, Colonel Botha.  I don't have any more questions of this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a>	If the Committee will recall Exhibit H was tendered and I had indicated that these were notes made or preparatory notes made in the course of an investigation.  A lot of the information had not been corroborated. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a>	It was then put to Mr Botha and some of the others that Pila Portia Ndwandwe had remained in attendance at the Ramlakan trial, which conflicted with the applicants' version, that she had left the country in 1986.  I have subsequently been able to confirm that in fact, she left the Republic in October of 1986, which means that she was not present at the Ramlakan trial, as was suggested to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a>	I thought it necessary to place that on record Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I thank my learned friend Mr Chairman, not that I believe that there was really a big point turning around it, but we thank him for his honesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a>	Mr Chairman, I have one question this time by way of exception, in re-examination.  I might deal with it immediately, unless the Committee has questions to this witness, in which event, we will stand down till tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a>	Well, then may I deal with the one question Mr Chairman.  Mr Du Preez, one easily thinks that if one arrests someone, take him to court and he is charged or put into jail for a period of time, that he would have no influence in the community, is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why do you say that is not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I think if we can just look at the ANC leaders at Robben Island and the influence they had on the organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In your experience, is it that messages were sent in and out of jail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that instructions were given from out of jail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Not just in our country, but all across the world?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, it is the general experience.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a>It is quarter past three Mr Chairman, I hope your dentist is going to be waiting for you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, my turn is half past.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Oh, I thought 3 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, half past.  Do you want to start another witness, or do you want to finish early?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We can start another witness, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> May I suggest that we take the adjournment now, we have one last witness, Mr Chairman.  By all accounts, we should be finished with the evidence tomorrow as a whole, so we are ahead of schedule.  If we call a witness now, he is going to stand over, we are not going to finish any of the cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, I would go along with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will adjourn until 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.</p>
