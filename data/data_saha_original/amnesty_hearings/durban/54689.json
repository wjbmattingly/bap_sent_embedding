He was at that time at the Westville Prison here in Durban, and we could not get him out timeously because I was told that a strike was going on at that prison, a POPCRU strike, and the police who are herein present indicated that they were going to assist me to get him down here.

Mr Chairman, I am going to refer to Evidence Book 2, page 54 thereof.  Book 2, page 54 thereof, Mr Chairman.  On page 54 there is a letter sent by us to the investigative unit requesting assistance inasfar as the service of form 2 is concerned.  Mr Chairman will note paragraph (b) affects this hearing as far as Mxenge is concerned, and these are the people implicated.  May I indicate that the first person, Sergeant B du Preez, has been informed.  I have a return of service.  The second one, Jan Abraham du Preez, the form has gone out, I have not received a return of service.  The third and the fourth is one and the same person, Warrant-Officer Paul van Dyk.  The form went out, but it was returned to me on the basis that the address given was a wrong address.  The fifth one, Captain Andrew R Taylor, it has been served, I have a return of service with me.  That is all in as far as it affects Mxenge.  Mr Chairman, there is another person affected by the Mxenge matter.  That is van der Hoven, who is a co-accused in the criminal trial, Mr Chairman.  We could not get the address for van der Hoven in order to inform him.  The\n\t/address\naddress was forwarded to me by letter late Friday in Cape Town, and by that time we did not have enough time to issue the form to him.

Those are the incidents which relate to paragraphs 3, 5 and 10 of the schedule to the applicants' application.\nMr Chairman, you would, with respect, appreciate that as far as the requirements of the Act is concerned, especially where evidence relating to orders and the justification and the perceived justification thereof is concerned, a certain amount of background evidence relating to the Security Police, the culture therein, and background information in general, will be relevant as far as that is concerned.  I intend leading the evidence about\n\t/the incident\nthe incident itself, and then returning to the background evidence as far as the Mxenge incident is concerned, but I will not be repeating that - all that background evidence in each and every case, as far as the Khondile and the Pillay case is concerned.

He brought down with him from Vlakplaas a hunting knife and two Okapi knives.  Four pieces of meat we got from the police single quarters kitchen, and I had a bottle of strychnine in the back of my car, green crystals which the farmers used in the earlier days for jackal, to kill jackal that caught their sheep.

For instance, not in the Security Police set up, but with the specific case of Captain Jack Le Grange and Sergeant Robert van der Merwe, who murdered two drug addicts and seriously wounded a third one.  At a stage after Almond Nofomela was sentenced to death in 1987 - I think it was round about '88 - they received two death sentences, the two white policemen, as first offenders, and 18 years for the one that they injured seriously.  Eventually their sentences were commuted by the State President to 25 and 15 years, and after three and a half years they are out on the streets.  Whilst Almond Nofomela, as a first offender, murdering a white farmer in 1986, received the death penalty only once, his sentence was commuted to 20 years, life in prison.  So what I want to say, if they want to help you there is a political will, there's a way out, like in the Jack Le Grange/Robert van der Merwe case.  Three and a half years, two murders, a serious assault, GBH with intent to kill, and they are out on the street.  So that is the 11th Commandment.  There's also the classic example of Major Menz, who's also now frequently mentioned, who was involved in quite few incidents.  He was at a stage in gaol for two years, or they received a year's sentence on two charges of assault, and after a few months General Johan Coetzee got them out of gaol in 1980/81, and the lately - I think he's still in the police, a major in the police.

            "time elapsed according to what I can - according to my memory, and the first time that I picked up poison from the - and knock-out drop, what we call it, from the police forensic laboratory, and specific from General Lothar Neethling, was on the 11th of October 1981, when Selby Mavusa was released from Brits Prison police cells after I got the instructions to get rid of him.  With Vusi, as we called him, there was another askari, Peter Dlamini, which we were also instructed to take out at the same time.  So I can remember picking up knock-out drops and poison from General Lothar Neethling for the first time on the 11th.  The poison did not work.  Koos Vermeulen, Captain Koos Vermeulen, went back the second day, after we administered it near Kopfontein Gate on a farm, which Koos Vermeulen used as a base whilst operating in the area.  He went back on the 12th to collect some more poison from Lothar Neethling, a double dose, which also did not work, and then General Lothar Neethling left for overseas.  At a stage - I think he returned on the 24th of October.  He went over twice in a short time, but on the 24th of October we were in the Groblersdal area, and that was the day that General Lothar Neethling came back from overseas.  We went to his house ...

I continued, myself and Paul van Dyk from Pretoria, down to Komatipoort, where we met up with Major Archie Flemington and two of his junior men, sergeants or warrant-officers - I can't remember the names unfortunately - and went to a piece of ground about 10 kilometres outside Komatipoort on the border gate road, on the farms where they join up, Avonstont and Constanopoulos.  Whilst we were there we turned left off towards the mountain.  It's very close to Lesotho border - ag, to the Mozambican border, and at the point where the old wagon route went over the mountain.  Three cement slabs is still left there up until this day, which I was able to detect a few months ago, and in line towards the road, from the mountain to the road - it's a very short distance, I would guess about one kilometre, if not less -it was an open veld with a few trees around, quite a distance from the main road.  Colonel Nick van Rensburg arrived with a Cortina vehicle with Captain Herman du Plessis, with the Sergeant Jan, and with Sizwe Khondile in a Balaclava and handcuffed.  They took the Balaclava off when he got out of the car.  I supplied the knock-out drops to - I can't remember which of his men administered it.

Now, drops were administered to Sizwe Khondile in a drink whilst we were sitting around drinking ourselves, opening beer and whatever other drinks - alcohol, and after about 20 minutes to half an hour Mr Khondile started - he was sitting down and uneasy.  He looked quite normal again to me when he arrived, as I said, not like someone with serious brain injuries that I could pick up.  He eventually fell over backwards and lie on his back, and at a stage either Colonel Nick van Rensburg or Major Flemington said, \"Well, chaps, let's get on with the job.\"  In the meantime the two junior officers of Major Archie Flemington, with a Land Cruiser bakkie, brought dense bush veld wood, big logs of it, with tyres, and one of Major Archie Flemington's men, a sergeant or a warrant - a slender-built tallish man, light hair - took a Makaroff pistol with a silencer on, and whilst he was lying - Mr Khondile was lying on his back, shot him on top of the head.  There was a short jerk and that was it.  The four junior non-commissioned officers, Paul van Dyk, Jan, Sergeant Jan from Colonel Nick van Rensburg's branch, and the two Ermelo men, each grabbed a hand and a foot, put it onto the pyre of tyre and wood, poured petrol on it, and set it alight.

I can just mention maybe perhaps that I did, with the help and assistance of a Japanese team, was able to honour Mrs Khondile's tradition in picking up her son's soul, and went to the place about three months ago to point out the place to the Japanese team, where the next day they took Mrs Khondile Sizwe's mother to where she could do the necessary traditional stuff that would have helped, but at the time I didn't have the courage to look her in the face.

I am presently indisposed, having recently undergone major surgery, and I am due to be hospitalised again this week.  I will obviously in these circumstances be unable to attend your hearing.  I have taken note of the contents of your notification and wish to comment as follows.  I deny most emphatically the allegations of Dirk Coetzee, and I deny further that I was in any way whatsoever involved in the alleged murder of a Gonisiwe Khondile.  I have become aware over the past years of various unfounded and untrue allegations made by Dirk Coetzee, in particular against\n\t/myself.\nmyself.  The said allegations were considered by the Full Bench of the Appellate Division, including the Honourable the Chief Justice of the Republic of South Africa.  I respectfully refer you to the reported decision of Neethling v du Preez and Others.  I concur fully with the findings of the Appellate Division, and I respectfully refer you in particular to the finding regarding Coetzee's evidence on page 801, where CJ CORBETT said his capacity for deception, mendacity and the fabrication of false evidence, and his ingenuity in this regard.  I require the above submissions to be read into the record, and to be taken into consideration by the Commission.  Kindly confirm in writing to the above address that my submissions have been read into the record.  I further reserve all my rights in the above regard, including my constitutional rights in terms of the provisions of the Constitution Act 200 of 1993.
