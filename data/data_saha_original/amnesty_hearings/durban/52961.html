<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ADV PRIOR:   We've resolved the issue on the following basis, there was no formal investigation report.  There are however certain witnesses that have been contacted either telephonically or via intermediaries.  Certain notes were made of those conversations.  I have not yet corroborated any of the information in those notes with witnesses who apparently are arriving during the course of today and insofar as that may constitute an investigation report, I'll make those available to all the parties with the provision, with the reservation that they are simply notes, they have not yet been substantiated and there's no indication at this stage whether any of those persons who will be present here today will be called.  Obviously that decision may change.  Photocopies are being prepared and I will distribute them to all the parties during the course of the morning.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In the event of the witnesses not being called, I take it they will remain confidential?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, Visser on record, might I just make our position clear?  It has never been the intention to ask any confidential notes of any consultations, that's not the point at all.  The only point is simply this, that if witnesses are going to be called, we would hate to ask for the matter to stand down for us to prepare at that stage, we would like beforehand just to be prepared so that if a witness gives evidence, one can cross-examine him immediately, it's as simple as that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>	If that is all Mr Chairman, may I then proceed?  First of all Mr Chairman, you will find before you two bundles, copies of Exhibit A, we gave you one yesterday which I would ask you just to uplift to add the two covering pages to it.  I'm not sure where it is floating around at the moment but I recall that we handed you one copy without the covering pages yesterday.  If I could uplift that for a moment, I could add the two covering pages for you and then you would each have a copy, Mr Chairman.  The problem which we have is that we don't seem to be able to have copies made with the facilities of the TRC here, but we have been able to recover some copies so that at least each of the Members of the Committee will have a copy.  We won't address that document now, Mr Chairman, we will do so when Mr Botha appears before you as a witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>If I may then continue with Mr Wasserman, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>	Mr Wasserman, you are still bound by your oath which you took yesterday to speak the truth, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">LAWRIE WASSERMAN:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> (Continued)  Mr Wasserman, you were present yesterday in the hall when Mr Rosslee gave evidence, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you listen to his evidence about how he saw experiences of policemen in the security branch during the years of the struggle, the political background and the influences which were exerted upon members of the security branch including pressures brought to bear, did you hear that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I heard that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And are you in agreement with that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I agree with that evidence Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I have no further questions thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, Rossouw on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>	Mr Wasserman, just a couple of questions.  When you arrived at the shooting range late the afternoon according to your evidence, you testified that you saw Mr Bosch there?  That's correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Did you discuss with him what was to happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Did you see anybody or were you present in a discussion with anybody else who might have taken the lead in explaining what was to happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> You weren't party to a discussion where for instance Mr Lembedi was told that he had to select the place where you were going to go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No I wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> So as far as you were aware, from the time that you were present at the shooting range that no such discussion took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Now in the vehicle on the way there did such a discussion take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No discussion like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If I understand it, you drove there in your own vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You stopped on the way and had a discussion with Major Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was in his vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was in his vehicle, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman, maybe I should just clear that up.  I was referring to the people all in the Combi when they left from the shooting range on the way to the location where the actual killing took place.  Did any discussion in the Combi take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In regards to what subject?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> What was going to happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, no discussions took place by them.  We were not going to discuss in front of Mr Bhila anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR ROUSSOUW</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, Van Schalkwyk for McCarter.  Just a single question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>	Do I understand your evidence correctly that the night in question or the day in question a person by the name of Aubrey Mogadi was never present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was never present, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VAN SCHALKWYK</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR HUGO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, Hugo on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>	Mr Wasserman, just one question, you heard I suppose that mention was made of a Honda vehicle that was hired and that was also used in the operation.  Were you aware of this vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I wasn't, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> I've got not further questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR HUGO</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>	Mr Wasserman, you say that you participated in the conflict in Zimbabwe before you could come to South Africa, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And when you participated in that conflict you say it was a war situation, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And when in Zimbabwe did you participate in the killing of innocent people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Although it was a war situation you never participated in the killing of innocent people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not innocent people Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And unarmed people, you never?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not unarmed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you participate in any act, criminal act, when you were in Zimbabwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No criminal acts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Your beliefs before you could come to South Africa, did you believe that you could kill in order to pursue a political motive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The killing would have only been in - any killing is only justified in a war situation and I was bound by that ethic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But could you kill for pursuing a political belief in unjustified circumstances, like self defence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't quite understand that fully.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Well, would you kill a person who was opposed to your political belief in illegal circumstances, just to kill him, just to advance a political belief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And in South Africa was there a stage where you could kill a person in pursuit of a political belief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not as a political belief per se but in normalising a situation and descaling a war, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Now are you suggesting that you would kill in circumstances when it would be legal for you to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> To kill who when it's legally to kill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't understand the question.  To kill when it's legally to kill?  What do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Are you - my question is, when you were in South Africa could you - was there a stage when you could kill in pursuit of a political motive knowing that in terms of the laws of the country it was illegal to kill a person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> I'm sorry, I still don't understand the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't know if you heard it, he said when it was illegal to kill a person, not when it was legal.  The question was, in South Africa would you, in furthering a political belief, kill a person when you knew it was illegal to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, that would happen, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You would?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes that would happen, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In furthering a political belief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> At what stage did you reach a point when you could kill in circumstances when it was illegal to do so in pursuance of a political belief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was the stage when the war status in Natal had reached so high that in our belief there was no other way but to kill the combatant concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Can you estimate in terms of years, round about which year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I would say round about the year of the matter in question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And before this Bhila killing, did you kill a person in circumstances which were illegal but in pursuit of a political motive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I believe there's an application here somewhere, I'm not sure if it was not just before this or just after but there is an amnesty application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Only one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> There is one application yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Are you in a position to identify that application, it related to whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The one that I'm referring to is a shoot out in Durban at the N2 bridgeway but I'm not sure of the date right now but it should be available to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Well if you say a shoot out, were those people shooting you and you were shooting back at them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We got in the shots first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Now ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> By that do you mean you shot them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We shot first yes, but there was a hand grenade there but ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They didn't shoot at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We were too quick Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> So your evidence is that before this Bhila killing, that was the only incident that you were involved in which occurred in circumstances that were illegal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No there's many here, there's other applications here but I don't know the date of this one that I'm referring to, if this was before Bhila or if it was shortly after Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is a copy of the complete application available?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN  SCHALKWYK:</span> Mr Chairman I understand that it's with the couriers and should be here this morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In order to be of some assistance Mr Chairman, I believe the witness is referring to what you have in</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">Exhibit A:</span> at page 24.  It's the so-called Quarry Road incident and it's dated the 9th August 1986.  I believe that chronologically that took place prior to the Bhila incident and that's the only one that I've been able to find, just glancing through the papers right now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Then that would be the one I'm referring to Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The other incidents follow the Bhila incident, I believe the Bhila incident, as I have it Mr Chairman, is the second one.  I incorrectly stated yesterday there were fifteen incidents for which this witness applies but there are eight but they all follow the Quarry Road incident at page 24.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you.  Now sir, the matters, all the matters in respect of which you have applied for amnesty are the matters in which you had been threatened with prosecution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You volunteered some other matters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes that is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> In this Bhila matter had you been threatened with prosecution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In the Bhila matter I was cautioned by Holmes but no threats were made, it was a straight forward warning statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And when you applied for amnesty in other matters had you been cautioned by Holmes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not in the other matters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you make your amnesty applications in other matters before you could make an application in the Bhila matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, altogether.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Now in terms of seniority, Taylor was your senior, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And did you at any stage plan with Mr Taylor the killing of Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No I did not Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> At what stage did you know for the first time that Bhila had to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was when we stopped, when I stopped behind Mr Taylor not far from the Railway Police shooting range.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Had Mr Taylor at any stage indicated to you that he was not happy about the acquittal of Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, none of us were happy with the acquittal of Mr Bhila, it was mentioned by us but that's where it stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And before the arrest now of Mr Bhila, could you kill for a political matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> If I knew exactly who the man was, how dangerous he was considered to be, how well military trained he was, what his activities were, that is likely that that could have ...[indistinct] yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you participate in the investigation of the matter against Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And did you participate in his arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I can't recall, I participated in many, many arrests over that period of time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> If you participated in his investigations the probabilities are that you must have participated in his arrest, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's not necessarily correct Mr Chairman, there was thirty or so personalities and I didn't arrest anywhere near half, so I am not certain about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And before he could be arrested you knew who he was and where he resided, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you knew that he was a dangerous man, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I knew he was a well trained Umkhonto weSizwe cadre, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Now why didn't you kill him before he could be arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Maybe I wasn't sent to arrest him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But you knew where ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It's not policy to kill somebody before you arrest them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You knew where he stayed, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I and the other investigators possibly knew where he stayed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> No, it's not possibly, you knew where he stayed, that's your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes I knew where he stayed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you knew who he was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Right and now can you advance a better reason why you didn't kill before he could be arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was arrested and taken before the court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> I'm asking you that because the suspicion I have is that you killed Bhila just because you were frustrated by the fact that he had been acquitted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's an incorrect impression to have, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And if you could kill for a political motive I put it to you that you had ample chance to kill him before he could be arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I think I have already answered that question, have I not Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Now coming to Mhieza, did you work closely with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> How many black members were working with you in your unit, closely as Mhieza did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I would say four to five, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, I didn't get you, is to 4 to 5 or 45?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, 4 to 5.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> As far you are aware where did Mr Mhieza reside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I beg your pardon sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Where did Mr Mhieza reside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Why did Mr Mhieza reside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Where.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Where did Mr Mhieza reside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In Umlazi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> That's very close to Lamontville, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Close by yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And Lembedi resided in Umbumbulu, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Umbumbulu I think was his tribal home, his rural home but I think he also had a residence in Umlazi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Well you say you think he had a residential home, you're not sure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But what you are sure about is that he resided in Umbumbulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That was his tribal home.  That is what you said isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes that's what I said, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you.  Thank you for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>	And as a person who worked closely with Mhieza, is it correct that he new Lamontville very well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It's correct, we all knew Lamontville quite well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And the people from Vlakplaas, like Ramatala, didn't know Lamontville is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman I'm unable to comment on that, I don't know how many operational trips Ramatala did down here, he might have known the township, he might not have, I don't know the man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> If Ramatala states that Mhieza pointed Bhila's house in Lamontville because he knew the place would you - what would be your comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I can't comment on that, I have no comment on that one at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Can you deny categorically that Mr Mhieza did assist Ramatala in arresting ...[indistinct] Mr Bhila in Lamontville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman I cannot deny that, I was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yesterday I saw you when you gave evidence, you were reading from a certain document, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes I had notes in front of me, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Do you still have those notes with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Are you prepared to make those notes available?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I would object to that Mr Chairman, they are consultation notes of ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The witness referred to them when he gave evidence, Mr Visser, I don't think your objection is well founded.  These were not consultation notes, he has just said he referred to those notes while he gave evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> With respect, Mr Chairman, they are notes made about instructions given and during consultation with counsel and ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And he elected to make use of them when he gave evidence.  It was for you to make sure that he did not, Mr Visser, if you wished them to remain confidential.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well Mr Chairman, I have no objection to that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Mr Chairman, with the leave of the Chairman and the Commissioners, may I have access to those notes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The witness has just told you he has no objection to making them available to you, he's not being compelled to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Can I have a look at those notes please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm certain my learned friend is then going to make his consultation available to us as well, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you intend to look at all of them before you continue your cross-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think we all need sit and wait while you do so, we will take a short adjournment.  If you will notify us when you are finished?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> There are 13 pages Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">LAWRIE WASSERMAN:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> (Continued)  I thank the Members of the Committee for the indulgence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>	Now Mr Wasserman, do you agree with me that the security branch of which you were a member was a very secretive organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No necessarily Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Well, if you say not necessarily, do you mean that it was not or it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was not necessarily secret, some of it's operations were clandestine and classified but we operated in the open so it is incorrect to say it was a secret organisation, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And let me put the question differently, is it correct that if you were involved in anything that was illegal, you were trained not to divulge any information at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And in fact it became a culture of the members of your branch to hide things that were illegal, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Have you, as you sit there, overcome that culture?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you undergo any rehabilitative treatment to overcome that culture or did you just overcome it on your own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Can you outline what kind of treatment you are referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Can you outline to me what treatment you are referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Well, to overcome that culture.  Were you trained in some form to get rid of the culture of being secretive of this ...[indistinct] thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, no Mr Chairman.  I would imagine time is one of the treatments.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Okay.  At page 44 of the bundle, Bhila bundle, paragraph 9(a)iv, you were asked about the nature and particulars of the incident and you didn't disclose anything about this incident, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you said you'd do the necessary research?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> What research did you have in mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Consultation with other parties at the time who had also applied for amnesty in terms of this Act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And subsequent to your completing this form did you submit anything written to the TRC on this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> On that I'm unable to recall, however I did attend two investigative hearings and I'm not sure whether this matter did come up in those or not but there was - I was with them twice and I'm not sure if Mr Bhila came up in that matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But do you agree with me that in all probability if you had submitted something in writing it would be available here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Oh, I didn't submit in writing but it was a verbal - two verbal sessions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Okay and did you think it necessary to submit something in writing to the TRC about this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well I knew I would be formally sitting in front of the TRC having to account at some stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> So you thought it was unnecessary to submit something in writing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was expecting as on the previous occasions either to be informed by legal counsel or to be notified by the TRC and then thirdly to formally appear as I am right now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You say in the paragraph I've quoted</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>"I will do the necessary research etc in an attempt to provide  a full and detailed statement which will be provided at a later stage."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> When you mentioned a statement at that time did you have in your mind a written statement or a verbal statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It's much or a muchness, it would have been in all probability a written statement, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Alright.  Now this document which I asked you to hand over - Mr Chairman I ask it to be handed in as  Exhibit G?  It doesn't have a date but it refers to November 1998.  Can you recall when you perhaps drafted it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well did you draft it or was it drafted by your lawyers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was drafted by my counsel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you very much, I'm indebted to the Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>	And when did it come into your possession, can you recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> At the time of this formally taking place, presumably - when did this start, Monday?  On Sunday evening prior to the Monday kick-off here, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you had consulted with Rosslee when the statement was prepared, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Rosslee was not there when I made the statement, when I was consulted over these notes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Well did you at any stage consult with Rosslee in preparation of this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Possibly a week prior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You consulted with him individually or with his - in the presence of your legal representative?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In the presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you had all the papers relating to his amnesty application and your amnesty application, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not all papers, I don't believe Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did Rosslee during the consultation indicate to you that in his amnesty application he had stated that you gave him instructions to kill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I beg your pardon, in Rosslee's amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I didn't hear you Mr Ngubane, say that again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Right, did Rosslee indicate to you that in his amnesty papers he had said that you gave him instructions to kill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I saw that yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And did you tell him that that was wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I pointed out that was wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And did you consult with any other applicant other than Rosslee regarding this incident prior to your coming to these hearings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And did Rosslee point - well was it pointed out to you during the consultation that there was an allegation that Mhieza was present when this operation took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I didn't understand that clearly, please say that again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Okay, was it pointed out to you at any stage during the consultations that there were allegations that Mhieza was present when this consultation took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, that became evident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And did you tell Rosslee that that was incorrect, Mhieza was not there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In my recollection I didn't think he was correct and I was correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Now yesterday I gained the impression of the fact that you were positive that Mhieza was not there, now you say "according to my recollection I didn't think that Mhieza was not there."</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, that's not what he said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just a moment.  That's not what he said, he said he pointed out at the consultation that he thought he was correct and Rosslee was wrong, that's what he said Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you.  Now what is your evidence, I want to get it clearly, I don't want to mislead you, was Mhieza there or he was not there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mhieza was not at the shooting range when I arrived at the shooting range.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you are positive about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I'm positive about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Now let's look at Exhibit G paragraph 44 where you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>"I certainly to this day cannot remember was that Spyker was at anytime involved in this incident or that Bhila was ever interrogated at the pistol shooting range."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>Those were your words, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> In this statement you say you cannot remember whether he was there or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's on the notes, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, really, with all due respect to my learned friend, he has now elicited an answer, a positive answer from the witness on a false statement made to him.  With all due respect to my learned friend he should just read the words and not interpret them and place his own interpretation on the clear words as they stand there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Mr Chairman, I've just read what is contained in the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Visser, I think the statement is badly drafted, if you read it you will find that it's confusing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But Mr Chairman, the problem here is this is not a statement and these were my consultation notes, that's the problem which we try to point out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Allow me then just to say that the consultation notes are confusing as drafted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Now let's turn to page 11 now at paragraph 40, the last line which starts with "we", you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a>"We also had reliable information that after his (meaning Bhila) release from the Ramatala case, he continued with his terrorist activities."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes that is here on the paper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you can't attribute that to bad drafting, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well they are only notes after all, it's</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> ...[inaudible] that sentence - oh, sorry Mr Chairman, it's last but one sentence, I made a mistake there.  Do you stand by what is contained there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He definitely would have continued with military activity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> No, no, no, my question is do you stand by what is contained in that sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> As I was informed, that is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And within three days of his release your information was that he had been involved in terrorist activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I didn't necessarily have the only information appertaining to Mr Bhila's activities.  If there was information on his activities which was not necessarily at hand to me, it could have been passed on by somebody else but I was informed by my officer commanding that he had reliable information that Bhila was to continue with his activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> He had reliable information that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That Bhila was continuing with his activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Were you told what those activities were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I knew what his activities were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You were never told what they were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It would have been the same as before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> No, answer my question, you were never told about those activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I cannot recall exactly what the wording would have been told to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you cannot recall whether you were ever told what those activities were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Had you been told in the past what they were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you were now told he was continuing with them by Major Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> By Major Taylor, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Let's come to the actual killing of Mr Bhila.  You say it was dark when he was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you indicated yesterday that you were standing at a distance of about ten paces from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Five to six paces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Five to six paces from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Alright, when the first shot was fired at him was he facing you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No he was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And was he facing the person that shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No he was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> He was facing away from the person who was shooting him is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Was there any moonlight on that particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I can't recall, it was dark but there was a silhouette.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You say he was shot in the head, did you manage to see where about in the head he was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And did you examine him after he had been shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did not Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And when at least a further shot was directed at him, you say it was also in the head or you don't know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No it was also in the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And he was lying down at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was in the lying position yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you didn't participate - well except by being there in the scene, you didn't participate in the actual shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I didn't participate at all in any of the shooting Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you say you also didn't participate in the interrogation of Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not at all Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Tell me, can you think of any reason why Mr Taylor would call you to the scene, to Mr Bhila, if you were not going to do anything at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> This is one occasion where I cannot - I have no reason why Mr Taylor called me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Now may I suggest to you that you were called specifically to participate in the interrogation of Mr Bhila and his assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is totally incorrect Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> When you consulted with Rosslee did he at any stage tell you that according to his recollection you were present when Bhila was interrogated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, not at all Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> This area where Bhila was killed, did you recognise it at the time when you took Bhila to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman, it was my first time ever to go there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And now you know how - well as you stand there, do you know the area now, the name of the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I know it in broad speaking terms as Umbumbulu area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And did anyone describe the area to you prior to the incident or after the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, not once Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Now let's look at the document Exhibit G again at page 13, paragraph 47.  You say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>"We followed directions given by Michael and drove off the tarmac road onto a dead road into an area where I knew that there to have been a lot of faction fighting going on at the time."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you stand by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did Major Taylor at any stage indicate to you how he had planned this operation, who were involved other than the people you have mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Major Taylor informed me that Bhila had been picked up as a result of him and the askaris and Vlakplaas members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you know about the presence of the Vlakplaas members and the askaris from that period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He informed me of their presence Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes he informed you about their presence when he met you on the way to Bhila, is that correct?  And prior to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Prior to that I knew that they were in Natal doing routine duties, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Had you met them at C.L. Swart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes I had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And had you had a discussion with them of any sort, that is Rosslee and McCarter and Bosch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes I'd had discussions with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Was it before the acquittal of Bhila or when was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It would have been from the date of their arrival, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Was there a stage from when Bhila was acquitted from the day when Bhila was acquitted when you, Rosslee, McCarter and Bosch and Taylor sat in an office to discuss any operation of whatever kind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you discuss at any stage with the Vlakplaas people any operation other than the Bhila operation when they were in Durban during that period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I must have done that, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And can you recall what operation you discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No I can't Mr Chairman, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But definitely it was not an operation to kill innocent people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is definite Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just ask a question here, the "killing innocent people" remains confusing to me, just using it, what do you understand under innocent people on that question when you answer it?  Was Bhila an innocent person or a guilty person in your mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was wandering that myself before you asked that as well, Mr Chairman.  However, no in my mind Mr Bhila was not an innocent person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He was not an innocent person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you.  Flowing from that did you at any stage with these Vlakplaas people I have referred to, discussed the killing of any Umkhonto weSizwe cadre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NGUBANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, Prior for the Amnesty Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>	At page 14 of the first Bhila bundle, the first bundle, at Bosch's application, he said:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a>"I went with Frank McCarter and Rosslee in a Ford Sierra, followed them till we got to the relevant suburb.  It was still in the morning when we got to the relevant place.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a>We all know that it was this pistol shooting range.  Can you think of any reason why Bosch would have that recollection when he made his amnesty application ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman I can't, there are a lot of suppositions I feel made in his statement as I've seen in evidence later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> This wasn't the first time for you to meet Bosch during the operation to kill Bhila, I mean you'd come down to Port Natal on other occasions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I hadn't met him, this was my first occasion to meet Steve Bosch, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> He goes on to say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>"Except for Laurie Wasserman there were also two members of the Durban Security Branch who was known to me as Warrant Spyker and Michael."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>At the pistol club he links you being present with Michael Lembedi and Spyker Mhieza, is that a mistake on his part?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, that's a mistake on his part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> At page 24 of the same bundle in respect of Mr Rosslee's application, he certainly when he conferred with his attorney round about that same year in '96 when he made this application, he said when he was in Durban he was met by you, Mr Wasserman of the local security branch and you told him, well them, that two of the accused, the Amanzimtoti bomb blast criminal trial had been acquitted, they were still continuing their subversive actions and that "our task was to arrest them for purposes of elimination."  That seems to be a very clear statement, would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I disagree with that statement entirely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> No, before we get onto that, it's a clear statement, he doesn't say well I think that happened or I may be mistaken, it's a clear statement of what he applies for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It's a clear statement Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes and that was made to his attorney.  I understand the same attorney that you had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> In Exhibit G at page 12, paragraph 42, you said the following or the note was made of the following and obviously this was a note prepared for you by your counsel after you had consulted with them.  You said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>"Thereafter and particularly after becoming aware of the recollections of Rosslee, while preparing for the present Amnesty Hearing, I was reminded of the circumstances and facts relating to the incidents and the events became clearer in my mind."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>Would that be an accurate note of the situation that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It's reasonably accurate Mr Chairman, he did present some circumstances which enabled recollection to come back to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Do you deny informing Rosslee and McCarter and/or Bosch as stated in Rosslee's application?</p>

<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> He says he can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>	As he testified here yesterday he had no independent recollection of that occurring?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No Mr Chairman, he conceded that he might be wrong because it was pointed out to him in his evidence in chief that it really is in contradiction with the first paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Well with respect, it's on the record, it's in an affidavit in his amnesty application and whether he denies it, with respect Mr Chairman, yesterday his evidence in '96 in these affidavits stands and ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm not objecting Mr Prior ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prior, what do you mean when you say his evidence in '96 stands when the man has on oath before us said something different?  We have to evaluate the evidence.  You can't say it stands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes I - sorry I agree with that, it's obviously at the end the day have to be evaluated as to it's veracity and reliability.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>	Well, when you consulted with Rosslee, was it at that stage that you made it clear that he was mistaken and you were correct that you had not informed them as set out in his amnesty application at page 24?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well it is correct, I had not informed them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> No, you had no recollection of that particular event, you were then confronted or you were informed that Rosslee had made the statement saying that you had in fact informed them of the two accused being acquitted, is that not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That was in his statement, I read it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You read it and then you then what?  Did you deny that or did you ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Of course I did Mr Chairman, it was incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You never said I had no recollection of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I denied it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And similarly with the allegation that you were present during this interrogation of Bhila at the pistol club?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I denied that, it was incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> But you agree do you not, that the body was disposed of in an area which was an IFP stronghold?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Even that is not a hundred percent correct in my knowledge, it was an area riddled by faction fighting but I'm not - at that point in time there was no clear lines between IFP strongholds and ANC.  One cannot actually go ahead and say that was an IFP area, that would be incorrect I feel, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So the idea was not to dispose of the body in an IFP area and obviously if the body was discovered everyone would assume that it was as a result of the - of faction fighting or something similar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I didn't know the area.  I wasn't given the story about it, I was told to accompany Mr Lembedi to an area that he knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> This Operation Butterfly, you were involved in the investigation rounding the events or the circumstances and following up on the arrests of various activists, is that correct, involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is the person Tami Zulu known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And Ralph Lawrence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The late Ralph Lawrence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Both of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes they're both known to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Where did the information come from regarding Operation Butterfly, was it those two persons?  Was it those two persons Mr Wasserman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was handling neither of those two persons so I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Are you saying you had no knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I had no knowledge of those two persons assisting me with information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> According to your investigation, Bhila had only been implicated in the bombing of the Lamontville township office, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And apart from receiving training internally, he would have been trained by one Dhlomo, according to the indictment and the summary of facts, he'd received training during I think May of the one year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I'm waiting for the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Well did you know that or ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes I was aware that he had been - he had received military training inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes and that he had been in fact indicted in respect of his training but the acts that he was responsible for was the Lamontville blast where structural damage was caused but no loss of life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I am aware of that yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> That was the only activity that he had been involved up until the stage of the trial, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is not strictly correct, I think that was correct enough for a legal indictment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Are you saying the police had more information, more evidence against Bhila but had not presented it to the Attorney General?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But there are other things mentioned in the indictment, Mr Prior.  His participation in the decision to kill Gideon Sibiya, that he established DLB's for the use of equipment.  These are offences, are they not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So how can you say all - the only things they were aware of was the training in the Lamontville bombing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And his training, his military training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Two episodes of training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I'm alive to that Mr Chairman, I simply wanted to distinguish that there was only one, in fact he was linked to one bomb blast.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was linked to one bomb blast but other - there were other things in the indictment about the person Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Could you not have dealt with Bhila in any other way, other than killing him, I mean could he have not been detained?  Further detained, Section 29?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> According to Major Taylor the decision had been made, his activities were continuing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So a decision had been made to eliminate him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> On the day Major Taylor told me he was to be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you get the impression that it was Taylor's decision or someone above or someone other than Taylor that had made that decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I can't comment on that decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Well what was your impression?  You said it had been decided?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, what would a Detective Sergeant have an impression, how does one get an impression that it's gone higher than the Major talking to you, there's no possible way that I could have made an impression that it went from somebody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If he said to you "we have decided" it would create an impression that it went somewhere else?  It's perfectly easy for it to create an impression.  I think you're being a little evasive there.  It depends on how Major Taylor told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He said he had made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Wasserman, I agree with to a certain extent what you say in paragraph 39 of Exhibit G.  I don't quite understand how you - why you were involved at all because on your version that you've given this Committee you seem to have done absolutely nothing to assist in killing Bhila other than being present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman, one will see in further applications things are different, however this one is as outlined.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was this a training run?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN  SCHALKWYK:</span> A training run of what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Well of things to come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Definitely not, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You see, I also have difficulty why Rosslee and McCarter would have been asked to kill Bhila, it could have been done by any member of the Durban branch, the Durban office?  Would you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> One can suppose so but it never happened like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do I understand from that, that you dispute that they were asked to kill Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> No not at all but what I want to suggest to this witness that his lack of activity on the day doesn't make sense, in fact what Rosslee had stated in his amnesty application, you would be, certainly have been involved at the level of interrogating Bhila at the pistol club?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's incorrect, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And if Rosslee is also correct when he says the information was there were two people acquitted and both had to be arrested and eliminated, certainly one would have expected Bhila to be questioned where the other person was, Nxiweni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We knew where Nxiweni was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So why wasn't he eliminated at the same time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It's not my decision Mr Chairman, I have no idea to that, I can't answer that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Just one question if I may Mr Chairman?  I think you did give evidence in your evidence in chief to say that Bhila was as far as your information went, acting together in concert with Kubezo is it or am I mistaken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> They were in the same unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They were in the same unit yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a>	I'm sorry, I might be mistaken here, do you refer to Zondo?  I'm asking you because my memory fails.  You were saying that Mr Bhila was in a unit together with someone else, who was that other person you referred to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You asked him the name Kubeza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I said so now Mr Chairman but I'm thinking that I might be mistaken, I think I ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well the applicant agreed with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where did Mr Zondo fit in as far Bhila was concerned, was there any connection between them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, same based unit as well Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see were the three of them in the same unit as far as your information went?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, plus others as well sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> You say that Mr Bhila got - did you know personally that Mr Bhila got the training from Duduzi Sithole?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Did I know personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And were you part of the - I mean from your evidence I understand that you were part of the team that was investigating Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And others, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And others.  I just want to get some information on Mr Bhila.  Do you know how many people were there in his unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not offhand, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> But did you know them at that time that you were investigating him, did you know how many people were there in his unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well I knew - there's a lot of names that were arising in the investigation.  I knew most of the names, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And did you know what rank he held - Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, not specifically, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did you know who was the head of that unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes I did Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Who was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The overall commander was Ramlakan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Ramlakan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Ramlakan.  Did you - were you part of the team that investigated the Amanzimtoti bombing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did you personally have information as to the presence of Mr Bhila in the Amanzimtoti bombing?  Did you personally know that he was there or was it a mere suspicion that he was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was involved in the unit that did perform that bombing incident, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> But do you know that he personally took the bomb to Amanzimtoti or did you not know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did not know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> But you just knew that he was part of that unit that was responsible for the bombing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> The other thing that I want to find out is after he was discharged at the close of the State's case, did you know what information the police had to present to the State that allowed the case against him to be withdrawn at the end of the State's case?  Did you have enough information for him to be charged in connection with the Amanzimtoti bombing as part of the investigating team?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't quite understand, Advocate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> What I want to find out is the information that you gave to the Attorney General as part of the investigating team did it link him directly to the Amanzimtoti bombing or did it not, as far as you can remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I can't recall, I was not actually working on that docket itself.  I was in the field, I don't know that fine a detail of the indictment and where it would have led involving Mr Bhila, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Now the place that was chosen to eliminate him - in fact just let me rephrase this, the point I'm getting to is your political objective.  When you chose to kill him at that place at Umbumbulu, did you - what message did you want to send out to the public, did you have any message that you wanted to send out to the public or did you want to kill him just to eliminate him from society so that nobody knows where he is or whatever happened to him.  Was that the intention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> There was no message intended for the public whatsoever, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> In other words you wanted this killing to be done in such a way that nobody would ever know about it, nobody would ever know what happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct at the time, that is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> How would this have helped the mere disappearance of a person, how would it have helped to reduce the incidents of bombing because there were other people in other units who would have remained continuing to do what Mr Bhila was doing?  How would his disappearance have helped to lower the spate of bombings that was going on at the time in your mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, he himself was a bomber, he used limpet mines, he had shown he used limpet mines, so by not being present he would not be there to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand your intention it was just to eliminate him to stop him doing what you thought he had been doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was to stop his activities Mr Chairman, his military activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did that mean that you had now embarked on a policy that where you couldn't arrest and charge people you were going to eliminate them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, that does not, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well why was Bhila specifically selected?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I wasn't present at the decision however I concurred that Mr Bhila was a dangerous man and the decision was then taken.  It was the only way to possibly stop this bombing campaign that had so devastated Durban just prior to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> But isn't that because - didn't you kill him because you were frustrated by the fact that he couldn't be convicted in the ordinary court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No definitely not, that's very incorrect Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> How would his killing have stopped other people from bombing if nobody knew what had ever happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> If it didn't stop other people or did would have been another story but it stopped him continuing the bombing that he was doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Isn't it fairly clear though, or I would have thought it was, that his comrades would have known of his disappearance and would have assumed that he'd been eliminated by the police or the intelligence organisations, security organisations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not necessarily Mr Chairman, he could have disappeared out of the country for further training and ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes and the comrades would know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> At a much later stage, the communication line was a little extended and confusion could have reigned before that supposition could have been made by them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Wasserman, may I just take this last question again to get it clear in my mind?  Your purpose or objective in eliminating Mr Bhila if I heard you correctly was simply to prevent him from ever bombing again?  You haven't advanced - you didn't agree with any of the other possible reasons suggested to you, I just wanted to get clarity in my mind as to why he was eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was to us a committed, well-trained Umkhonto weSize soldier who had already proved his military worth, he was a fighter, he was a danger and the decision was taken by my commander for his elimination.  I don't know what else to say in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes but there was no message to be sent, it wouldn't have led to a reduction necessarily in bombings, in terms of your responses, I'm referring to your answers and you said that he would never be able to bomb again.  I think those were more or less your words and that was the objective and result?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well Mr Chairman, the Chair had asked me why specifically him and that was my answer to that portion of the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But on the evidence you've been giving in respect of Bhila you said you don't know if he took the bomb there, you don't know if he was part of the unit so the military work that you had now say he had proved was merely that he was member of a unit of which we are told there were many members which had committed a bombing.  Why pick on him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's not quite correct, Mr Chairman.  He take the bomb to the Lamontville offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said a few minutes ago you don't know if he took the bomb there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, that was the Amanzimtoti bomb Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm sorry, Amanzimtoti.  So you knew he had taken one bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes I was aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that was all?  And you knew other people had done similar things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I knew of other people yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The question still in my mind is, he was killed because he was dangerous and could have or would have continued with his activities or did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He could have been charged if you had knowledge of continuation of activities, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is so, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So why did you decide not to charge him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It wasn't my decision sir, to charge him or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, but you agreed with the decision of Taylor that he had to be taken out, that was your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why did you not ask Taylor "should we not charge him?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I can't really answer that, I cannot answer you there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Is it not so that there was no indication that he had continued with any activities, that he was simply killed because he was acquitted and if you had evidence that he should have been convicted but you couldn't lead that evidence because you would be exposing informers or witnesses were intimidated or whatever?  Isn't that the real reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I wouldn't say he was eliminated merely because he walked away from a court room, I feel that that would be an incorrect thing to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, no, let us assume then for the moment that he was that dangerous person, with the whole record, his historical record of involvement that you are holding up to us, let's assume that for the moment.  Wasn't that exactly the reason why he was killed?  Because he was acquitted and he had this track record, he should have been convicted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was killed because he was going to continue with his activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You said that you and this was read to you, we also had reliable information that after his release indeed did continue with his activities and you told us under cross-examination that that was what Taylor told you, that he indeed did continue with his activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's what Taylor told me, yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now on that score, if I take you back to page 42, Bhila bundle, if you could just refer to that?  That's Taylor's application and unfortunately, we have only his statement under oath.  Taylor said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a>"Bhila was acquitted"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a>That's 3.3 on page 42.  Taylor says in his application:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a>"Bhila was acquitted because we had information, although he was acquitted, we had information of a nature which could not be used in evidence."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a>Do you read that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes I do sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then 3.4 he says"</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a>"I realised that Bhila would not stop."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a>Not "was continuing" - "would not stop"</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a>And 3.5:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a>"I thereupon requested certain parties for Bhila to be killed."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now does this accord with your evidence of Taylor's communication to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I feel it does.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Didn't you just tell us that Taylor told you that he had to be eliminated because he was indeed active again in terrorist activities, that he did not stop?  I mean this was held up to you, the notes that you referred to and surely as was pointed out, they're simply the notes of your counsel as he drafted them.  He might have made a mistake but it was put to you and you confirmed that specific part, that Taylor indeed told you that he was still active?</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, that's what I was informed Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why did Taylor not disclose that in his application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I have no idea why Taylor did not disclose it sir, I have no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Don't you think that should have been a crucial part of it as far as Taylor is concerned because otherwise we have to read it as blunt as it stands here "he was acquitted".</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a>We knew he wouldn't stop so we couldn't stop him through a conviction and therefore we would eliminate him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It does look like that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If you would stay with Taylor's application, that's page 42.  3.6 he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a>"I was not present when Bhila was killed."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a>Now surely he wasn't present in terms of all the evidence here, he was the only one staying behind at the shooting range according to all evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Major Taylor wasn't present when Mr Bhila was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But he was present at the shooting range when the others left to kill Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Taylor - yes when I left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He stayed behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was behind yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And when you returned he was still there and there was a report to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So - but he was the only one staying behind on the evidence of the applicants?  Everybody else and I put that question to you yesterday, everybody else went into the Combi but Taylor stayed behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I have no idea about the other people Mr Chairman, I didn't know the Vlakplaas people down at that stage or they left shortly after, I have no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But the Vlakplaas people went with you in the Combi, I'm not talking askaris, I'm talking the three members that you were talking about.  Let's talk about the white members.  He was the only white member staying behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes to my knowledge he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If you read paragraph 3.6, well if you read his whole affidavit there's not indication at all that he was involved at the shooting range, at the interception, simply that he put out a request and it was complied with.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a>"I have heard"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a>he says in 3.6</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>"That others were involved and that he was killed."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a>If he was indeed at the shooting range would he have not have said "I have knowledge that they were involved because I sent them, I stayed behind when they went out, I gave instructions for them."?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I was not with Mr Taylor when he made this affidavit, I have no - I cannot comment on what was going on then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Alright.  The day at the shooting range, I still have not the slightest idea of what possibly could have been discussed or talked about in conversation because we have no information as to any topic discussed in the whole of the time that you were present at the shooting range.  Can you recall any discussion, any topic discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I only arrived late at the shooting range in the first instance so I'm unable to state</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a>...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> ...[inaudible] You only went out to kill him after dark.  You drove in the dark and then that was the general ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you must have been there for at least three hours at that time of year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Nothing discussed during those three hours, nothing talked about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It's a long time ago, we must have discussed numerous topics, I suppose activities in Durban, other activities but we never certainly discussed anything about Mr Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You discussed all the other activities but not Bhila who is the centre of attention at that moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You also gave evidence that you had knowledge about the whereabouts of Mr Ngewene and knew where he was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Where was he at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was ninety percent of the time at Alan Taylor residence and also in the Transkei, he would disappear down to the Transkei in between and return.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you also had knowledge about the whereabouts of Mr Bhila, you knew where he stayed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> On questions ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, before you go on.  He had been in detention for how long?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I'm under correction your Chair, but I would imagine a year plus, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what you're talking about is what happened before he was taken into detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What you would have been interested in this day, on this day is where he had been for the last three days and only the last three days.  Did you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No I didn't know that, not myself, not personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You responded under cross-examination by Mr Ngubane to a question saying that you were trained not to divulge any information on illegal actions.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Actually on all actions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Shall we adjourn now?  We'll take the adjournment now.</p>

<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a>Can you tell us what this is about?  What structures are you talking about?</p>

<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> May I have it translated into English properly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Well you wrote it in Afrikaans but ask your lawyer to translate for you.  Should I try and do it?  Alright listen, I'll read it again and then you can listen to the translation.</p>

<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What structures are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> There were covert operations in order to achieve the objectives of our operational tasks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, that we accept but here you make a different statement.  You are saying that you were involved with the setting up of structures, operational structures or involved in the establishment, the maintenance and the expansion or development of certain operational structures.  We're not talking activities or actions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Oh okay, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Or programmes, we're talking about structures.  One would assume that would be a kind of a body that was set up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I understand now sir, I'm sorry about that I had problems with the headphones and now I understand the question.  Yes I was involved in the establishment, that was the restructuring of our sections and our units in our methods and forms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In which way, was that an internal restructuring of your unit, methods and forms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was a member of the unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, no, that's not what you're saying here, you are saying that you were actively involved, I'm using the actively because that's what it's saying.  You were involved</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>"I was involved with the foundation of certain operational structures"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a>What structures are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I think it's word that in English I wouldn't have used it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now what would you have used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was involved in the creation of new methods, new tactics, new ways of countering the military problem that was ahead of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you tell us something about that?  New methods, new ways?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well the creation of informer networks across the borders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That was my principle involvement in the restructuring of our operational ethos Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If you read what is immediately preceding this paragraph 7 on page 123, you are referring to the general threat, the revolutionary onslaught, paragraph 3, that you were against this kind of philosophy.  Page 4, that you believed that your actions were justifiable.  Paragraph 5, you refer to the no go areas internally.  Paragraph 6 that you saw it as your task to prevent the execution of such attacks and then suddenly in 7 you refer to certain structures that were founded.  You're not referring to any cross border operations here, you're referring to the internal threat, security threat as you perceived it.  If I put it to you that every applicant in the second bundle makes exactly the same statement in their paragraph 7 with the exception of one, which is Mr Vorster, where he says in that paragraph, not that he was involved but that he had knowledge of certain structures, of these structures.  What structures are you referring to, Mr Wasserman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> As I've already said this must be the structures within the security branch that were formed, the remodelling of my unit, it must have been that structure.  I was not part of any other structure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If you say it must have been then it seems that you're not owning this paragraph, that you simply try to interpret what someone else wrote on your behalf?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> This is rather the legal side rather than mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But Mr Wasserman, did you not read your application before you gave it over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So when you read this paragraph did it not make any impression on you?  You're talking about structures that were suddenly founded because of the threat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I took it to be as I've explained to the Commission that that would have sufficed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You're not talking - if you continue with this paragraph - you're not talking only of - I don't know whether I have to read it to you or whether I shouldn't necessarily pursue it.  But let me read it to, I continuing</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a>"These operations included the gathering of information as well as actions which were launched in order to obtain such information on both a pro-active and a reactive way."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a>But you refer to operations here, not to structures.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a>"These type of actions"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a>and it continues with the actions but you don't speak any more of structures.  If I put it to you that - and this was my first impression when I read all of this - it seems to me that there's some kind of disclosure here about an internal structure which would have done things which did not fall within the framework of the law but which was managed within the unit.  I say this is my impression and I'd like to have an explanation for this, an explanation that makes sense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman, there was no internal, no structure as such that was set up with positions and ranks and things like that, we were a unit, we were the MK counter-intelligence unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was there not some kind of arrangement that when people were to be taken out as in the case of Bhila that such a decision would be made on a need to know basis or a prior agreed circle of people privileged to information and participation in such decisions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes a decision as serious as that would not be a readily available decision to everybody on the security branch at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But Mr Taylor did inform you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He did sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he need your acquiesence in terms of the implementation according to the structures and procedures set up in the structures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No sir.  To my knowledge there was no such structure as you are outlining to me right now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So Taylor would have taken that decision on his own and he had the authority to take it on his own in your understanding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In my understanding, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So he could take decisions and you had to follow the orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If he decided that Bhila had to be taken out, he could have done so within the branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I think that was correct to say that yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That's how you understood it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I do sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And he would not necessarily have to seek any clearance above then, is that not what the structures are referring to, that's my question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't know what went on above Major Taylor's ranks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you involved in any discussions with him earlier about taking out people and that he would have had the authority to make such decisions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No sir, we never discussed or he never discussed with his subordinates what his mandates were and what his authorities would be, that was never coming down to the Sergeant's level.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you have no other explanation for your having put this paragraph in the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No the paragraph is, it's there, it exists, I see it.  I don't fully understand it the way I understood it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You see it leaves the impression especially because it comes from all the other applicants and the person who claims not to have been involved, claims knowledge of the existence of such structures, that's Mr Vorster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Maybe he can outline what structures are being referred to here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Well I guess that goes for every applicant.  You see you need to make full disclosure and if you do make a statement, you need to be able to substantiate that to us.  Alright, let me just say to you that, I want to go back on my tracks to pursue the question that I put to you immediately before we took the tea break.  The one about your having been trained not to divulge information on the legal actions and I think your last response was that that statement was valid for all actions.  You were not to divulge information on any action.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, in terms of the Official Secrets Act, what was ever classified, was classified and non-divulgible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes but certainly in terms the Official Secrets Act illegal activities are not classified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well then I mean if we weren't going to talk about legal actions Mr Chair, we wouldn't have spoken about illegal ones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now the question was put to you whether you were trained not to divulge any information on illegal actions and you answered that in the positive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well it's the culture of any intelligence service.  I've never undergone any formal training, I wouldn't know how people are trained not to divulge things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I thought that you would be giving us more information linking this to this paragraph 7 on page 123 that I have read out to you and the question is really was there not a structure or were there no structures within your unit busying themselves indeed with illegal actions and that within the frame of those structures and those involved in the structures that you were trained not to divulge information on illegal actions, that's really the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman, I was totally unaware of such a structure, totally unaware of such a structure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you have no explanation really for why you refer to structures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, in fact this is an English/Afrikaans mistake somehow, mix up here sir and I apologise to the Commission for that but there is nothing like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> It really cannot be an English/Afrikaans mistake, it cannot simply be a mistake of having, of your not having understood it but in all the others and most of the other applicants are Afrikaans speaking, clearly, in exactly the same words, making exactly the same statement but you had no knowledge of such structures that they refer to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Definitely to my working knowledge there was no such structure, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Because most of the others were your seniors in any event.  Is it possible that such structures did exist, that there was some kind of a conspiracy within the unit, did you have any such notion at any stage that decisions were made about illegal actions of which you were not part of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Decisions were certainly made but I would have said it was ....[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Illegal activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct but I would have said it was done by the rank structures.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In other words Taylor and others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> By the rank structure, correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Within the unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And then one last question, no I needn't ask this question of you at this stage, we can perhaps leave that for the second part of the application.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many people were there in your unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman I would imagine 12 or so, possibly more, we had two legs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the commanding officer of the unit was Major Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was under him?  By that I mean who was the next ranking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It would have been Colonel Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well he would surely have been above Major Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No but this - I'm talking about the last of their ranks of course, I was referring to their last ranks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The rank at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It would have been Major Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Major Botha.  There was Lieutenant du Preez, there were Warrant Officers Lembedi and Mhieza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I don't think you know all the rest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was a sergeant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say you had three officers in the unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now you've been asked about the place where the shooting took place and I gather it's the first time you'd been there, you can't now tell us where it was.  Can you give us an estimate of how long it took to drive there from the shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, the best part of an hour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does that include the time that you spent changing the wheel or is it an hour's driving time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I would say an hour's driving time, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And an hour back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And some minutes changing the wheel and some minutes shooting the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And all this time Major Taylor remained sitting back at the shooting range, as far as you know, by himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> As far as I know he was there when I came back, he might have left and done other things, I'm not aware of that, but he was there to meet us or to meet me on return.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why was that?  Why should he want to be there to meet you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No he was - he would have wanted to know the result, he would have wanted to know the position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Surely he could have asked you to phone him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman, this kind of thing was to be discussed with my mouth only.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well what were you going to discuss, surely all you had to say everything went well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, that's all and that was the end of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I can't see why you can't say that on the telephone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It just wasn't done, the instructions were "you come back, report to me physically and we'll break after that."</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry Chairperson.  And when you reported back to him did you give him details as to how you killed Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did you say you shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Who gave the report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Who gave the report to Major Taylor, who actually told him about what happened at Umbumbulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well I gave a report to him, I don't know if anybody else in the bus also spoke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And Mr Makata, did he give any report to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't know if he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> You gave the report to Major Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I spoke to Major Taylor, I don't know if the other people spoke to Major Taylor but I informed him of the report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Was it just the two of you or were there other people present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Which two?</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Was it just the two of you and Major Taylor or were there other people present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, there was just Major Taylor and I spoke about it with each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> What happened to the other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I think they were still at their vehicles getting into their vehicles.  I don't know what they were doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> So can you remember your words, did you say everything went well?  He didn't ask for details as to who shot and where and all that detail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, might I be allowed arising from some of the questions put just to ask this witness in clarification of something?  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a>Mr Wasserman you knew Major Taylor well, did you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He died, I believe, approximately a year ago?</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was his condition, his mental condition if I may put it that way, prior to his death for example in 1996 as far as you personally are aware?</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No by that stage his health was remarkably deteriorating, cancer was all over his body and his memory was very badly effected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> His memory was badly effected.  Yes, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a>	May the witness then be excused?  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a>Mr Chairman I don't know what the rest of the procedure is, I think I should hand back to Mr Prior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is that the evidence from the applicants on the Bhila incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.  If I may say it's the only evidence that we are going to present on behalf of the persons for who we appear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I then call or ask leave to call Mr Ramatala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> My attorney reminds me I should have made it clear that Mr Botha's evidence of course will obviously become relevant to Bhila's case in general as well.  Thank you Mr Chairman and then there's Mr Taylor's application, I don't know whether that's going to be dealt with now or later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Possibly we can hear from Mr Nel regarding the Taylor application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  I'm not quite sure how and what the procedure regarding Mr Taylor's application would be.  I don't know if the Chair could assist me, we have never dealt with an application of a deceased person before.  Perhaps Mr Prior can assist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The decision as to whether we give a ruling can wait for the moment.  Are you going to call any other evidence in support of Mr Taylor's application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> May I then proceed with Mr Ramatala?  Please come forward Mr Ramatala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">ERNEST RAMATALA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Ramatala, we're glad to have you here today and you are here to talk about or tell the Committee about what you know about the events surrounding the abduction or kidnapping of Mr Bhila during February of 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before we do that can we have your full names, Mr Ramatala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> My name is Ernest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I beg your pardon Mr Chairman, I thought he read that out.  Now, if you could just give a bit of background to yourself, before 1987 and up till 1987 were you in the employ of the security police stationed at Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And were you a member of Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Now is it correct that, it seems to be common cause that on the 10th February 1987 a unit from Vlakplaas was sent down to Port Natal, that is Durban Port Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Under the command of Mr Frank McCarter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> And Andrew Letate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And with that group was also, we've heard, evidence Mr Bosch, Mr Rosslee and certain other members of Vlakplaas, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Can you remember who the other persons were other than the persons I've now mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> It myself, Letate, Pekkie Gadebe, Malaleka, Nobela, Tulo, Aaron Mtengo and another one by the name of Shakes Malaleka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> There were two Malalekas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> What part of your contingent were there two Malalekas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Definitely, another one is the one who has been released from prison, he's the one that I was with him to Mr Bhila's place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Alright, we'll get to that.  We've heard evidence that this unit was sent down on routine work in the Port Natal area and at some stage an instruction was given to make contact with Mr Bhila in Lamontville, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Tell the Committee in your own words what you recall, what you remember about that evidence, about that event?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I recall when Mr Makata and Mr Letate briefed us that "gentlemen, there's somebody who has been released from prison that we must go and make an arrest."  So he was telling the whole group, then from there he said you, Ernest</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a>and Nobela and Shakes, I must go and show you that place.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> So we went to Lamontville, myself, Letsatse, Gadebe, Spyker Mhieza and Nobela to Bhila's place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And was that in Lamontville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> In Lamontville.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> What was shown to you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> We were going to be shown the house of Mr Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Were you shown the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> We would drive driving with the Combi, towards this area, can be the third house from this one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And who did that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Mhieza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Then from there, when on the way I asked him so that we can prepare ourselves, is he a terrorist?  They said no, he might have a crash course.  So ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Sorry, I don't follow that, you said you asked whether he was a terrorist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Or not so that we can go to that place knowing exactly what type of person that was, is he going to fight or is he going to suspect us.  We were trying to prepare ourselves mentally and ...[indistinct] when we were approaching them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And you said something about a crash course, who said that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> It's Spyker Mhieza said that no, he might have some crash course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Well did you get the impression from Mhieza that he was a terrorist or a dangerous person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, Mhieza was putting it to us that he is not a dangerous person to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes please continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Now then from there they drop us somewhere, we went to find the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was there any plan how you were to approach Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> The plan was we must tell him that we are the people from UDF, we want to do some further - we are going to tell him something further concerning the UDF, further instruction from UDF.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes, what was the next thing that happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> So we managed to get inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Who was all with you when you got inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That time it was myself, Nobela and this Shakes Malaleka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And when you say you got inside was that at the home of Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> At the home of Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you find him there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> We found him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes continue please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> So we talked to him.  He himself arranged for a day or two, somewhere there, that he will come and meet us somewhere at Kentucky.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So you spoke to Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> We spoke to Bhila and said "my friend, we are comrades from UDF, we are coming to you, we have been sent to discuss further things with you but we want a safe place."</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And the Kentucky was nominated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> He's the one really he said that "I think Kentucky will be a safe place for us."</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is that the Kentucky in Lamontville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> At Lamontville</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And when was the arrangement to meet him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> It can be a day or two after that first meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Alright take the Committee through the sequence as you remember it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Then from there we go back to the Combi and report to the Combi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Who did you report to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> To Letsatse and Mhieza and Gadebe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Now we go back to C. R. Swart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> To what place there, was it any particular office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Well we used not to go to the security branch, we used to stay where we slept because only Letsatse and these three went to the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You say you never used to go to the offices, why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> They used to say that it's very much important if only the seniors, they are the ones that can know information and details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So you went to another place within C. R. Swart Square?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And what was the next thing that happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Now we wait for them now again to what is the arrangement, now it was to get the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So did anyone come back to you and discuss about the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> On the way, in actual fact on the way now when we're discussing about this, now the plan was now we must get the car now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Sorry let's just find out what day was that?  You'd gone to Bhila, you'd made contact, you'd mentioned the Kentucky, you came back to C. R. Swart Square?</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.  So on our way back to C. R. Swart we were discussing about the next method we are going to use now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> The method to get hold of Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Again by using the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So what car was discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, we never discussed the description of the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Oh I see.  Alright, did anything else happen on that same day that you had made contact with Bhila?  Well, what was of importance, obviously things happened but what was the next thing in connection with obtaining Bhila or fetching Bhila from Lamontville.  What was the next thing that happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> As far as I know to get Mr Bhila it was for the sake of information that security want information from Mr Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And then what was done, was there any plan, firm plan discussed of how you were going to get him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> We did plan this thing when we go there, that we can go and talk to Mr Bhila and try to see how can we get him out of his place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And what plan was that, what was the plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> The plan was, if he can come, now we went to take him out.  I mean they went to take us, with him, on the way but that one didn't work lekker.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.  So now Mr Bhila postponed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And he mentioned the Kentucky?</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> The Kentucky.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Alright, now we've put that day behind us.  When was the next time you went to Lamontville now to fetch Bhila or to meet with Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Now the car was there and it was a Honda that I've been given the keys by Letsatse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes, where was this Honda obtained from, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, seen Honda at C.R. Swart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was it a new vehicle, an old vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> It was a new second hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> In good condition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> In very good condition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And you obtained the keys at C.R. Swart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And what was your instruction there and who gave you your instructions from C.R. Swart onwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Okay gentlemen, you go, we are going to deploy two Combis somewhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Who said that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Mr Lekata and Mr Letsatse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And what was your role, what were you to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> My role was the driver of the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Of the Honda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Oh yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And who went with you in the Honda vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> The same two guys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> When you first approached Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> We wait, he was little bit late about 15 minutes late.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was that at the Kentucky?</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> At the Kentucky.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many days was that after you first spoke to Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> A day or two, somewhere there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you remember what time of day it was when you first met him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> The first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Somewhere round about 11 in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the second meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> The second meeting I think was 12 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes, please tell the Committee what happened on that second meeting at about 12 o'clock, you said he was slightly late?</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes we were there meeting in the car so they arranged that he must sit at the back.  There was one guy in the back, I was sitting with another one in front.  So ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes just tell us, sorry, so that we can get clarity, who was in the vehicle with you when Mr Bhila got into the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> It was Nobela and Shakes Malaleka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Can we just pause there?  You said something about the Shakes Malaleka being released from prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Just go into that in a little detail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> This Shakes, he was involved in a shooting somewhere, somebody died here in Durban ...[indistinct] or something like that.  Now he was in detention, something like that or in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> But was he involved with any political, with any political organisation or not, to your knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> He's a former member of ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Sorry, I just don't follow quite clearly, you say he was taken out of prison, for what purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> To rejoin the group again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you know whether he knew Mr Bhila or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, no he was not sure of Mr Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Had Mr Malaleka, the Shakes Malaleka, had he been briefed on the purpose of the visit to Mr Bhila or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> He was with us when we were briefed by our seniors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was he prepared to go along with you to Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Alright, so Mr Bhila then joins you in the vehicle, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And where did you then go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> According to the plan we were supposed to go out of Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Well what - just tell us a bit more detail, what was your instruction and who gave you the instruction where you were to drive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> They said that we must try to get out of Durban, Mr Letsatse and Mhieza now, who was giving us that instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And was that before you got to Lamontville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Okay so he's in the vehicle, what then happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Now we drove, we're trying to move but I think a few metres, the two Combis were there, intercepting us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was that still in Lamontville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Outside Kentucky, little bit outside there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Were you still near the Kentucky when the Combi stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No it was something like now next to the chemist there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So you started your vehicle, you moved off a short distance as I understand it and the two Combis were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Tell us what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> The instruction was we are going to be getting some ...[indistinct] all of us, so that Mr Bhila he must be confused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Just tell us what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> They cross, they come in front of me and stop me, now Mike Mhieza, he was the one now that came that "you are driving shit, you are driving shit"  Now started beating me now, he start to open the door, beating Mr Bhila, the other one now start to beat me.  We went to the Combi so when I was in the Combi they say no, come, come, come, go and drive the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> When you say someone beat you, do you know who slapped you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No I don't really recall who did ...[indistinct]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And then Mr Bhila you say was taken into the Combi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Into the Combi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And you were told to get into your vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Can you say who was in the vehicle in which Mr Bhila was placed, who were the members that were there, can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> There were two Combis, all the members were there but I never saw the white members during that vicinity but black members, all of them were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Now which black members are you referring to?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You came down to Durban with a number of policemen from Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And askaris I understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Are you referring to that group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I'm referring to that group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> In addition to that group were there any members from the Durban office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes it was Mhieza and Mike Lembedi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Can you remember whether Bhila, Mr Bhila said anything when he was taken into the Combi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, no nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And then from that point in Lamontville where you were intercepted, what happened, where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Three of us, now we go back to the car, we go straight to C.R. Swart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And what happened at C.R. Swart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Ten minutes or fifteen minutes time, Letsatse arrived and took the car's keys and took off the number plate of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That was the end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Well did you ask him anything about what happened to Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you ever see Mr Bhila again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> It was the first time, I never seen him again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you never see him again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No I never saw him again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you ever make enquiries as to what possibly had happened to him after that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you know that he was to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Now is it correct that you were approached in July of '96 by Captain Holmes of the D'Oliveira Special Investigating Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And is it correct that you made a statement to Mr Holmes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And it was recorded in Afrikaans, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And you signed - we have a copy, is it correct is it your signature that appears?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes that's my signature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And you told Mr Holmes what you could remember of the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And is there anything else you wish to tell the Committee regarding this event?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> In actual fact we were not aware that they were going to kill him because if an operation like that one, a serious one like that one, we were involved, usually we used to get some bonuses, but this one of Mr Bhila we didn't get the bonus because it was stated to us that he is just an active member inside whose got only the mere crash course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you say you usually get a bonus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is that bonus paid by?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Our seniors at the Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And was that a bonus when people were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Not exactly killed, even when we have arrested somebody from the ANC camp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You got a bonus for doing your job?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, may I hand up or formally introduce the statement, which has been circulated to all the interested parties as Exhibit E?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the Ramatala statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Ramatala, I'm just interested to know, in 1987 were you an askari or were you a policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> A policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would you perhaps just push your button?  And the bonuses you speak about, for what do you say you were paid bonuses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> For any arrest of somebody we used to call as a terrorist or somebody who is highly active on the ANC activities, we used to get bonuses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see and who would pay you those bonuses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> One of our seniors, they used to make a claim and we get it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see yes.  Do you know a person by the name of Stanley Moni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you have anything to do with Stanley Moni or did Stanley Moni have anything to do with your contact with Mr Bhila in February 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No I don't recall Stanley Moni taking any part in this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Wasn't it part of the plan that Mr Bhila was to be told that the security branch was going to arrest him again and that you and your fellow policemen or the askaris that went with you would offer him assistance to get him out of the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So how did you suggest to Mr Bhila, what did you suggest to him in order to lure him away from his home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Let me put it clear to you, Mr Bhila when he came to us, there was no bag to show that he's going out, he just came empty handed so how can we arrange for him to go out without clothes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, no, no, I don't think you understand what I'm saying.  There was a plan, there was a plot to try to lure him away from his home so that he could be arrested, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was that plan, was it not that to tell him that he must come, that you would take him out of the country to save him from being arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I think we differ when coming to send him out, the plan was to take him for further instruction from the UDF.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see, I see, is that how you remember it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> It's how it was, exactly like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes and after Bhila was placed in the Combi, you came back to C.R. Swart and you knew nothing about what further happened to Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I've got no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, Van Schalkwyk on behalf of McCarter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a>	Mr Ramatala, at the time you said you were a member of the South African Police Force, what was your rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Constable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Constable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did you carry a pocket book with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> What?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did you carry a pocket book with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Now did you make any entries in the pocket book about these events?  Do you want me to repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I want to explain to you.  My job was the security, the pocket book was not to be used to a sensitive information like that one, how can you use the pocket book for a thing like that one of Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> The point of the matter, there's no other entry or there's no entry that you made on the day in question about the events?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, pocket book was for your own interest, if you want to keep something for your own information.  There was nobody to check up on that book.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Let me ask you again, did you make any - I'll ask it a little bit differently, did you make any entry on ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He did say - I mean that's clear that he said that he didn't make any entry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Thank you.  So apart - when you made your statement to Holmes in 1996, did you have anything to look at, anything to refresh your memory with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Were you shown any statements by Holmes in order to refresh your memory?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Were you shown any documents by Holmes to refresh your memory from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Are you quite sure about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> ...[indistinct]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Well in paragraph 4 of the statement that was handed up, appears the following sentence and least it be a mistake because of the languages, let me put it to you, it will be interpreted</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a>"I can recall the incident as follows.  Our group according to the documents that were shown to me"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a>...[inaudible] your statement referred to if nothing was shown to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, you see the documents that he showed me, it was the document for the claim of the S&amp;T</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> So documents were in fact shown to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Ja, for the S&amp;T</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Then you say an interesting thing further on in the statement, allow me to read it to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a>"And an independent witness"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a>That is something I want to clarify from you because my copy Mr Chairman is little unclear, it could be "geheer" or "getui" if I might just clarify that?  If it's "geheer" I'll accept it, mine is unfortunately not clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a>	Perhaps if I may just ask the witness, did you discuss the matter with any witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Right and you were not shown a statement for instance by Mr Bosch or Mr Rosslee or anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Not, now I want to canvass with you the presence of the various members of the Durban branch of the security police.  Did you at the time know a certain, I think his rank at the time was Sergeant, Aubrey Nogade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Was he a member of your unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> At Pretoria or in Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Well when we were down here he was not around, not knowing maybe he arrived in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> He was not involved in the incident that you have sketched at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Abducting, he was not around as far as I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Right.  When you made and if I may just briefly ask you a few questions about this statement, when you made the statement to Mr Holmes, were you under the impression that this was going to be used in a case docket to be opened or built against somebody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Can you repeat the question again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> When you made the statement did you think that this statement was going to be used in a case docket, a police docket against someone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I was making the statement for the only part that I had played, not knowing what's going to happen in future.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> You were not asked to make a statement or were you asked to make a statement as a witness so to speak, you were not accused of having done something wrong and given an opportunity to explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Well I can say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> And have you all along been aware of or under the impression rather that you would be a witness in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> That the Attorney General's office obviously were investigating?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> You yourself and pardon me for asking you this, have not applied for amnesty for this particular incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> In your mind you did nothing wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I have never been in the killing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> As far as you're concerned that is the bit that's wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> When you were given these instructions in your own mind did you think this would just have been an arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> We used to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> That was part of your normal duties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Part of the game.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Now you seem to sketch two different incidents that happened on two days.  Firstly you would go out to the scene, the general vicinity would have been pointed out to you and then later you went back, do I understand that correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> On that first occasion, let us deal with that.  You say that it was Mhieza who had pointed out, as I understood you, sort of the general area or did he point out a specific house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Mhieza knows that place very well, he said to us: "I don't want to be very close because he knows me, but you check from this"  They give us the number of the house, can be number three to number four and you just count the houses and it was like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> He did not point out the specific house to you, that's all I want to know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> By pointing a specific house in the sense that he was there next to the house is this one, no, but he said that you go along this number, it will be number 5, then you get it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Was Mike Lembedi present at that particular point in time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Mike?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Lembedi was he present.  Lembedi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was Lembedi present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, no, no.  When - no, the first - he was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Well before you went out to this place was there a discussion between yourselves and McCarter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Mr McCarter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Concerning this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VAN SCHALWYK:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Well he was briefing us as the group that is going to go there.  Then from there he singled out exact three that is going to be there, that you and this one, you are going to be involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did you know Mr Bhila prior to this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Were you given information about Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> There was a photo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Were you given any other information about him apart from the photo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> What?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That's he fit gentleman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> They said that he is very fit, that's all, physically fit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> And were you told that he was locally trained, I think you used the word crash course?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> We went to Mr Bhila without any firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Were you told - I'll repeat the question - that he was locally trained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> They said that he undergo crash course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> That is all they told you about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly, how can we go a terrorist without firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Granted but was any other information about Bhila given to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> To identify Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Any other information about Bhila, sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Well the one, that house, there's a gentleman there and he is fit, it was like that.  You go to that house, the gentleman was there and he was fit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Was anything mentioned about him appearing in a court matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I said that we were discussing on the way from Durban to Bhila's place, what I want to be clear about, these arrests, are we going - I just want - by then I was trying to secure the bonus, that are we going to get the bonus.  Now it was clear that no, he was not a terrorist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr van Schalkwyk, sorry, will you not demarcate the different time periods and places and when you want to know about discussions, it's perhaps too complex to leave it open, the questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did Mr McCarter at any stage mentioned anything about this man having appeared in court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> But I don't know how can I answer this because if three - four senior people, they are briefing us about certain guy, all four cannot talk at once, that we are going to Bhila - what, what, what, what, - that's why, but I cannot recall exactly what did Mr McCarter said, that he was the part of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Mr Ramatala, least we're at cross purposes, do I understand correctly that you can't recall McCarter telling you that Bhila was involved in a court case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Well that I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I don't understand your answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Well I agree with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> You can't recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> You're telling me about the court case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> However, that is something that you mentioned in your statement, that you recalled in 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a>You say:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a>"We were informed about a person who was involved in a court case in Pietermaritzburg."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Probably this thing happened long time ago ...[inaudible] so one can still make a small mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Well I'm going to suggest to you sir that you are also making a mistake about Mhieza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Just before you pursue Mhieza, the statement, Mr Ramatala, says that you were addressed by Mr McCarter.  If I understood you correct there were other people present when you were addressed by Mr McCarter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And at that meeting you were informed about the acquittal and the court case by someone but you say you can't remember whether it was Mr McCarter, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, I think that one of the case it was Mhieza who was now talking about the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But at that same meeting were you told about the case and the acquittal or was it another meeting, I mean these were the questions put to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> He had not, definitely on that meeting again there somebody, can be Mr McCarter who talked about the guy who was being released from the prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you told that he had been found not guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Not guilty, that's it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you're not sure whether Mr McCarter told you or someone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But are you sure he was present when you were informed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you, Mr van Schalkwyk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Thank you Mr Malan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a>	Well, can you remember who else was present at that particular meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> How can I?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Can you remember who else was present at that meeting, that Mr Malan has just asked you about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Which meeting - the last briefing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, Mr Ramatala, the question if you have your statement before you, well it's in Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, it's in Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you said that you attended a meeting, all the members attended a meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> At C.R. Swart, where Mr McCarter addressed you.  You also said that you were informed at that meeting.  Now granted you're not saying who gave you the information but it reads as if it was Mr McCarter.  You were informed during that meeting that a person was found not guilty in the court case.  Now the question of Mr van Schalkwayk is, at that meeting where Mr McCarter addressed you, apart from your group, who else was present because you gave us the information about your group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> What had happened Mr McCarter ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Ramatala do you want me to repeat that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes I want to answer that question now.  You see at that meeting ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> If your light goes off you're not being recorded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Okay, can I leave it like this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Just press the button now and that will be alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes please just go ahead and answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Mr McCarter addressed the whole group but now when choosing the one that going there, again we were briefed, now when I say that now, the issue of this guy who was being discharged it was being discussed there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Apart from Mr McCarter was there any other member of the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Who was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Mhieza was there, Pekkie was there, Letsatse was there and these was two other ones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Incidently, when you made your statement to Mr Holmes, did he specifically ask you about Mhieza, did he ask you was there a person by the name of Mhieza present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Well that might be but I know Mhieza very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did Holmes ask you about Mhieza, how well you knew him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> It was not suggested by him that Mhieza was present on the day in question and you were asked to comment on it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Right now then you went back for the second time, let's deal with that particular set of events.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a>Mhieza was not present when you went back, in fact to get Bhila, is that correct?  To meet Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> The first one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> No, I'm talking about the second set of events.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, the second one when we went to Mr Bhila, we were only three guys in the Honda.  Mhieza was with others in the Combis.  Now Mhieza came when now they stopped us, he was coming from the Combi now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Let's deal with when you were stopped as you say, was it a case of your vehicle being taken off or pushed off the road, intercepted as it were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I was the part of the game, I was aware that what was going to happen, so I did it purposely that as if there's something wrong.  These people they just stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> And did both Combis stop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Were there any so-called white members present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I said that in that area I didn't see any white people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> No one in the Combis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, I didn't see, not even a single one in the Combi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Mr McCarter certainly not there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I cannot deny maybe he was in the Combi sitting but I didn't see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Is it possible then that in the Combi there could have been other members as well, other white members as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That can be possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Alright, you then say it was Mhieza and Lembedi as I understand your statement who took over Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> It was not perhaps McCarter and Lembedi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I'm going to suggest to you so that as far as this incident is concerned that you are wrong as far as Mr Mhieza's role or the role that you attribute to him is concerned, he was not there, it was Lembedi what pointed out the house, it was Lembedi who with McCarter took hold of Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> And Mr McCarter in my car, in that Combi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> No, at the end when your vehicle was pulled off so to speak, I say so in inverted commas if one can do so, it was McCarter and Lembedi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> My instructions from Mhieza is in any event that he was not there, he did not take part in this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> He was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> At the best for you, you're mistaken about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, no, no, he was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> These other gentlemen that were with you, Mr Letsatse and the other gentlemen in your vehicle, Shakes - what was his name again would you remind me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> His surname is Malaleka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Malaleka.  Do you know whether they ever made statements to the police, to Mr Holmes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> They were not there with you when you made your statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, I was making a statement alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Have you ever discussed this matter with them after the event?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Do you know if these two gentlemen are still around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> You've not had any contact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Dealing with the S &amp; T forms, I've just had a look at that, are you saying that there were S &amp; T forms also made out for this person Shakes Malaleka or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Is it your version that he was at one stage incarcerated and then he came out and took part in this operation, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> By then he was not a policeman by then, when he came back from jail so it was impossible to clear him for somebody who is not the part of the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Alright.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VAN SCHALKWYK</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just ask, is it not possible that a claim form was put in on behalf of Mr Mhieza in order to collect the money to hand to Shakes Malaleka, is that not a possibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> It was the money that has been used in the operation like this one, maybe to give the people money to go to the shebeen, you see, to do anything in the line of the duty, you understand?  So that money maybe he was getting the S &amp; T from that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you're basically saying this relates only to S &amp; T, it wouldn't - the claim forms wouldn't have involved bonuses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, no, no, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR HUGO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a>	Mr Ramatala you'll just have to bear with me, your evidence in chief you testified at a rapid pace so I might have to ask you some questions just to clarify as to what you said.  Can I just go first of all to Exhibit E, that is the affidavit that was procured by Captain Holmes, have you got it in front of you?  You have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Right at the last page at the bottom it says there it was signed on the 17th July 1996 at Ladybrand.  Were you living in Ladybrand at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And I take it you're a Sotho speaking man, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Then will you just go back to the first page of this affidavit?  There it says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a>"I Tomelo Ernest Ramatala make this statement in Sotho under oath."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Can you repeat it in English?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well it says there I Tomelo Ernest Ramatala declares in Sotho under oath"</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a>that's the translation of the Afrikaans portion, do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Oh yes, but I was speaking English you know, I don't know what had happened but I could say that this is a Sotho speaking person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> No, but it's very clear from this document that you were speaking, ostensibly speaking Sotho at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> So what were you speaking when you made this affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I was speaking English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And were there any interpreters present when you made this affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And were you happy with the contents of this affidavit before you signed it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Man the atmosphere was so conducive so I couldn't have any doubt about ...[indistinct]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> No, but that's not with all due respect a proper answer to the question.  Let me ask you first, did you go through the affidavit before you signed it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> After writing this thing he explained in English I've said this and this and this and this, it's formally what we have been speaking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes Mr Ramatala, but you're an experienced policeman, you actually joined the security police in 1981 so you know full well what the affidavits are all about.  Were you happy, as an experienced policeman that the contents of this affidavit were correct and that you were happy with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now can you just tell us a little bit about your background?  How did it come about that you ended up at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I'm very sorry I cannot discuss that here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a>It's not relevant to this case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well Mr Ramatala, it is unfortunately relevant and I'm going to point out to you why it's relevant, so won't you just answer the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I said I would never answer that question because it's not relevant to this one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well Mr Ramatala, let me ask you this.  Were you involved as an ANC member in student activities in Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Nothing, I hear when Mr McCarter made that mistake yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> So are you saying that this proposition was wrong in the sense that you were never involved in student activities in Lesotho, as an ANC member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now can you just then tell us why do you think that Mr McCarter chose you to approach Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I want to give a full answer there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Two days before that we had a quarrel with Mr McCarter concerning Letsatse.  Mr McCarter said that ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Sorry Mr Ramatala, may I just ask you to ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I'm trying to explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> May I just ask you to speak a little it slower, I find it difficult to follow you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I want to come to a point, so I said that I want to explain so that you can understand.  I say that previous days we had a quarrel with Mr McCarter concerning Letsatse, so Mr McCarter used the word that I'm trying to build my own complex in the police force but it was to my surprise when he said that I was an experienced person and for that matter Mr McCarter managed to promote the whole section excluding me.  How can today he mention that I'm an experienced and then when the benefits - I don't enjoy the benefits.  I want to put it to you that Mr McCarter is trying to grab anything that he'd say, human nature is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes but what I don't understand still is, on what basis were you picked to go and approach an ANC member like Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">MR HU:</span> GO:   The guy was not an ANC trained person, maybe for my intelligence so that the guy can really believe what I'm saying.  Is it true that you were an askari before you joined the South African Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.  The interpretation of an askari, judge, do you really understand what does that mean?  It means that somebody has been a member of the organisation now trained and joined the ...[indistinct] I have never been trained.  He mentioned that thing, he arrived at the Vlakplaas while I was there for five years before, six years, so he didn't know me very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now I want to go over to the group that was sent down from Vlakplaas.  You said in your evidence in chief that Shakes Malaleka was also part of this group, did I understand you correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That's Shakes Malaleka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> That he was part of a group that was sent down from Pretoria to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, he joined us here, he was right here in Durban by then, in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And he was in prison here in Durban when you arrived here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That's Malaleka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Shakes Malaleka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now when did you meet Mr Shakes Malaleka for the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I think it was the first day when we are going to make the first contact with Mr Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> In which jail was Mr Malaleka detained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I was not sure of the jail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And how did he get out of jail, how was he released?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That question you're supposed to put it to them because I do not - they used to control, they used to do everything that they can do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> But if you say you - they - who are you referring to, just give us specific names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Well Malaleka was the part of the group from Pretoria but he was being arrested some - or years or months before we came here.  Now he was in Durban, now he was released the time we are here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes but it's important to us to know who was instrumental in releasing Mr Shakes Malaleka from jail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That one I won't have any knowledge about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> When you saw Mr Shakes Malaleka for the first time after he had been released and he'd been taken to, I suppose, C.R. Swart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And with whom was Mr Shakes Malaleka when he arrived at C.R. Swart, who was in his presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I cannot remember the time he was coming, no I just saw him as part of the group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well let me just put it to you that we're acting for Mr Willie Malaleka, do you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, now Mr Willie Malaleka says that he was present when a person and we have been in contact with him, he initially said it was a Stanley Moni but he has now conceded that he might have the name wrong, when a person was released from jail or booked out of jail and his recollection was that members of the Durban security branch were present and instrumental in having him released.  Can you remember whether Mr Shakes Malaleka arrived at C.R. Swart in the presence of Mr Malaleka, Willie Malaleka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Then before we carry on I just want to clarify one further aspect and that is the initial purpose of this operation, was it a routine, was it to be a routine operation when you were sent down from Pretoria to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a>MR RAMATALA:   Yes, routine operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> So at that stage there was no mention of a specific operation that you were going to participate in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And is it also then true that Mr de Kock, Mr Eugene de Kock who was the commander of Vlakplaas at that time, was on leave during this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And do you confirm as is set out in Exhibit E that Mr Bosch actually travelled down to Durban in Mr de Kock's BMW?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Bosch was driving Mr de Kock's BMW.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now the first order group that you were talking about, where you were informed as to what your participation would be in this operation, what was the date, when did that take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I don't remember the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well we now have it on record that the 20th was the first time, the 20th February 1987, was the first time that contact had been made with Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I don't remember the date that ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well was it a day before the 20th, two days before the 20th, or on the same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> What do you mean, same day when we arrived from Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> No, no, when you were first, for the first time instructed to partake in this operation.  This is the order group that was held and amongst other people Mr McCarter had addressed you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Can you repeat?  I don't hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Look, all I want to ascertain is, you met Mr Bhila on the 20th February, we now have that, it's common cause.  Prior to that, when was this order group held when you were told to go and meet Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, Mr Hugo just before you proceed.  I may be lost but why do you say it's common cause that the meeting with Bhila was on the 20th, the first meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well if I say so, I think most of the witnesses have conceded that - no, I fact I actually put it I think Mr McCarter as well that - but Mr Malaleka said that they met on the 20th, but I'm sure as to whether I put it to Mr McCarter.  	If we accept just for the moment that this meeting was -that your first approach to Mr Bhila took place on the 20th, when did the first order group meeting take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> ...[inaudible] but I said it, I cannot remember the dates but what I only remember when making contact with Mr - now he said that we must see him a day or two after that day, so I really don't know how to fit the days nicely there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, well we - let me put it to you that the 20th was the Friday and the 22nd when Mr Bhila was killed was a Sunday.  Can you remember whether it was a Thursday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I think on Sunday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Ramatala, if I may just see if I can help you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a>If I understand the question correctly is, it is you met for the first time with Bhila on the 20th and assuming that is so, you met with Bhila for the first time on a specific day.  That meeting that you had which you were instructed, briefed and then instructed, it's the smaller group, to locate Mr Bhila, when did that meeting take place, was it on the same day that you went to Bhila or was it the day before or two days before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Same day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, Mr Chairman I see it's 1 o'clock, I don't know whether it's a convenient time to take the adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll now adjourn till 2 o'clock.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, before you proceed, Visser on record.  I've been requested by Mr Rosslee to enquire from you whether he might be excused Mr Chairman.  He's basically only involved in the Bhila application and he's got a job waiting for him in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I take it Mr Visser if something arises, we can arrange his recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Oh certainly yes Mr Chairman.  It just seems unlikely, that's why I'm asking you at the moment.  But certainly he can be called back if it's necessary.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think that's a reasonable request.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> (continues) Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a>	Mr Ramatala, you said in your evidence in chief that you were instructed by McCarter and then you said that Mr Letsatse briefed us, can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> What exactly did Mr Letsatse tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> By briefing us he was telling us that gentlemen, you must do what I said you must do.  Nothing that - you must get the instruction that I'm going to give him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> No but can you just give us the details when he was briefing you, what exactly did he tell you to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> My understanding, why I said briefing, that we are going to listen, we are going to get the instruction from him, he is going to lead us, he is going to tell us what to do.  We are going to report back to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Does that mean that Mr Letsatse didn't give you particular instructions as to how you should go about for instance about contacting Mr Bhila etc?  He just said to you look, he was going to be the leader and you should report to him, is that what you meant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, how can I assume that I must go to Mr Bhila without the immediate command of Letsatse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well, didn't Mr McCarter tell you about Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Mr McCarter told us about Mr Bhila but on the way we were with Mr Letsatse, somebody who is the commander right at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well Mr Ramatala, let me just put it to you that we're acting also for Mr Letsatse.  He says that he was never present during this initial briefing session and he'd never been told about Mr Bhila and let me finish - that he assumes that all the instructions came from Mr McCarter and he wasn't told about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Mr Letsatse by that time he was a senior to Mr McCarter, how can Mr Letsatse not know of this operation while he was a senior to McCarter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> You would agree though that Mr Letsatse came from Pretoria and to the best of your knowledge there was no ways that he could have had any knowledge pertaining to Mr Bhila prior to have coming down to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That one I agree with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Then you said in your evidence in chief that you then went to Lamontville and you were shown the house of Mr Bhila and you said the people who went with you were - well the one person was Mr Letsatse and you mentioned Nobela and a Mr Radebe.  Now let me put it to you that we're also acting for Mr Radebe and both Mr Radebe and Letsatse say that they never went to the house or to Lamontville, what do you say to that?  Aren't you just making a mistake here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, not to the house but at Lamontville, they were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> This was the initial visit to the house when you, on your version, when Mr Mhieza pointed the house out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> I just want to get back to Mr Shakes Malaleka, was Mr Malaleka a former member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And I think maybe you must just get us some clarity on that, to the best of your knowledge did Mr Malaleka, this is Mr Shakes Malaleka, did he know Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> So what was Mr Shakes Malaleka's participation during the initial conversation with Mr Bhila when Mr Bhila was convinced to attend a meeting two days later at the Kentucky Fried Chicken building in Lamontville, can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Who would you say was instrumental during this conversation in convincing Mr Bhila to go to the Kentucky rendezvous point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Ja, whom of the three of you that went in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I would say between myself and Nobela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Mr Nobela was he a former member of the ANC or is he just a normal policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> A normal policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And what would you say made Mr Bhila decide to go to Kentucky, what convinced him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I don't really recall but what I recall is that Mr Biela suggested another day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He suggested what?  Another day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Another day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Would you say that you yourself were convincing enough to persuade Mr Bhila that you had intimate knowledge of the ANC structures or at least the UDF structures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> At Mr Bhila's place there was no time to discuss of the structures, the only thing was to introduce ourself as comrade to him, then we want a communal place to speak.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And are you saying that he didn't ask any further questions, he didn't verify as to whether you were bona fide members of the UDF and/or the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Mr Ramatala, you also said in your evidence in chief that after that particular meeting, you then went back and you reported to Mr Letsatse, Mr Mhieza and Mr Radebe, do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Let me just put it to you that Mr Letsatse and Mr Radebe are both saying that they weren't there and they deny that you reported to them.  What do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> To whom did I report now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well, they're just saying that you didn't report to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> And let me put it clear again to you, we were using one Combi that was being driven by Mr Letsatse so Mr Gadebe and Mhieza was in the Combi.  Now how can we travel from Lamontville to C.R. Swart without going to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Both Mr Letsatse and Mr Radebe will say that they weren't in the Combi, they never went to Mr Bhila's house, it must have been somebody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I said they were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Then you also said that Mr Letsatse, after this meeting with Mr Bhila, with Mr Mhieza, went to the office and I take it you're referring to the office at C.R. Swart, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Whom did they go and see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Well I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now let me just put it to you for completeness sake that Mr Letsatse once more says that he never went to an office after this particular incident to go and report whatever was to be reported?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Or after this thing.  He was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now Mr Ramatala, something that I found astounding was the conversation on your version that took place in the combi after the first incident, after the first meeting with Mr Bhila, on your way back to C.R. Swart, can you just recall what took place, what was decided?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> From Mr Bhila's place to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> To C.R. Swart yes, that's after you had agreed to meet Mr Bhila at the Kentucky here in two days time, at the Kentucky building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Then it was to report back what did we find, the discussion with Mr Bhila, the arrangement, what did he say because they were not sure that Mr Bhila will say that we will meet at Kentucky so that is the thing that came with Mr Bhila during our discussion so we were supposed to tell Mr Letsatse and others about what had happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, no but you then testified that it was decided that a car should be obtained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Well according to the nature of the operation now there was supposed to be the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes but whose idea was this that a car should be hired, why couldn't you use the same Combi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> The Combi was well known that the police are using Combis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well, why didn't you go to Mr Bhila's place in the first instance with a Combi then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I think you didn't understand, we didn't go straight to Mr Bhila's place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Sorry, you're correct there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> So you decided that a combi shouldn't be used and a car should be hired.  Whose idea was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Well that one I don't know but I think all of us now, we were discussing about what can we use.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now if you say all of us, I take it you're referring to Mr Letsatse, on your version, Mr Mhieza, Mr Radebe and Mr Nobela, yourself and Shakes Malaleka, those were the ones who were in the Combi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now, Mr Ramatala, who was going to pay for this car that was to be hired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> In my understanding I can pay for the car for the State myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> No, I'm not asking you to speculate, I'm asking you what was agreed as to who would pay for this car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That one was beyond my reach really, I wouldn't know whose going to hire, whose going to provide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And what was discussed, where would they hire this car from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That one I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And was the idea that the car would be hired by the black members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That one I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> You see Mr Letsatse says that he finds this absolutely amazing that the black would hire a car and Mr Letsatse says further that they didn't have credit cards or any other means to go and hire a car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That's true but Mr Letsatse can facilitate that thing, acting between senior policeman whose going to fetch the car and give it to Letsatse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well let me put it to you that Mr Malaleka who we are also acting for, it's Mr Willie Malaleka, he says that he can recall that a car was indeed hired but his recollection is that the car was hired by the Durban security police.  What would you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> But he says obviously that he wasn't part and parcel of the discussion or the decision, he just saw this car and heard later that it was hired by the security police in Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Then you testified that you were given this car or the car was handed over to you by Mr Letsatse once it had been hired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now Mr Letsatse once more says this is not so, he was never part and parcel of an operation where this particular car was handed over to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Oh, to Mr Letsatse who was driving the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well didn't you say that you drove the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a>I mean there were three of you in this particular vehicle, it's you, it's Mr Nobela, Mr Malaleka and then later Mr Bhila was in the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes, what I'm trying to say that the car was hired, I was given the car by Mr Letsatse, I was the one who was driving the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes.  I think you did say, I asked you about Mr Shakes Malaleka, he was a former member of the ANC, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> He had intimate knowledge of the structures, would you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Or would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Then you said in your evidence that you were told to go out of Durban, that was - those instructions were given to you by Mr Mhieza and Mr Letsatse, do you remember saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now Mr Letsatse once more says that he wasn't involved in this, he never gave you those instructions.  Are you sure that he did and it was maybe not just Mr Mhieza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Hundred percent sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now I just want to deal with a so-called interception.  So you were then travelling in this Honda vehicle and if I understand your evidence correctly, you were then approached by two Combis, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now how many occupants were there in these Combis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> It's very difficult for me to know the number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes was Mr Radebe in this Combi or in one of the Combis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> One thing sure he was having one of the Combis and Letsatse was driving one other one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And Mr Malaleka, Mr Willie Malaleka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> He must be in one of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> No, no, not must be, was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> In the Combis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Well, he was supposed to be there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> No, no, that's not good enough Mr Ramatala, you must tell us, to the best of your knowledge and recollection, was Mr Malaleka in one of the Combis and it's important, I'll tell you now why.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Okay.  Not knowing if maybe something happened on the way but they were in the Combis from C.R. Swart when we are about to go to that place so I don't know if maybe somewhere on the way, they dropped one or two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well let me put it to you why I'm saying it's important, Mr Malaleka's version, Mr Willie Malaleka's version is that he was in a Combi and he just kept observation at Kentucky Fried Chicken building when Mr Bhila got into your car and after that he departed from the scene and he went back to C.R. Swart.  What do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Using what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> A Combi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> As far as I remember when they stopped us, two Combis were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well you seem to be a bit unsure now, is it possible that Mr Malaleka could be right on this score?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That's possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> So if we said that then it's possible that there was only one Combi during the interception, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Two combis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> No but you've just conceded that it's possible that there was just one Combi or that the other Combi could have gone to - back to C.R. Swart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> When, after?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I don't think that's a reasonable deduction, I think what is reasonable to say that there might have been a third Combi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well Mr Ramatala, were there three Combis used by the group at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Then you said that ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many Combis or where did you see the Combis at C.R. Swart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> We came down from Pretoria to C.R. Swart with two Combis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You had two Combis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Two Combis, I know the drivers of those two Combis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But did C.R. Swarts not possibly have a Combi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Possible they might have one Combi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Mr Ramatala, you then also testified and if I - you must please correct me if I understood you wrongly, but it was prearranged that the Combi, your vehicle would be stopped and then that you would be assaulted and slapped around, is that the gist of what you wanted to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Assault not to cause injuries but to make as if there is a fight, to convince - even the gentleman he must not know what is happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes but who arranged this, who told you beforehand that this was going to happen to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> We used to do such a thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> No, but you see that's something else, Mr Ramatala, can you remember who arranged this beforehand, who told you, who was instrumental in arranging for this act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Oh I don't remember the particular person arranging but I mean a name but there was a saying that "gentlemen we will stop you and we will be a little bit rough".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And were any of the black members, did they partake in roughing you up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Which ones?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I cannot remember because ...[indistinct] I was trying to run to other Combi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1545"><a name="pos1545"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And did any of the white members from Vlakplaas partake in this particular act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I didn't see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And what do you say, Mr McCarter testified that he was there during this interception and he was responsible for Mr Bhila being taken into the Combi and McCarter away to the shooting range.  What do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I deny that thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now you also alluded in your evidence in chief to the registration number of this vehicle that was changed, the number plates.  When did or when were these number plates changed, can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I said immediately after - from Kentucky, after they abduct Mr Bhila from us, I went straight to C.R. Swart, according to the instructions of Letsatse.  Ten to fifteen minutes Letsatse arrived, demand the car keys and take off the plate numbers of the very same vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And were there other plate numbers underneath those ones?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No I didn't see other number plates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well let me just put it to you also for completeness sake, Letsatse says he was not involved in the changing of these number plates at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Now if he denies everything, I don't know but he was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now Mr Ramatala, you said that you didn't apply for amnesty and your perception was that there was no need for you to apply for amnesty in the sense that you didn't do anything wrong.  Are you still of the same opinion today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And I don't want you to give us a legal opinion, that would be unfair but would you say to the best of your knowledge there was any need for the other black members that partook in this operation to apply for amnesty in the sense that they did anything wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> So I must talk on behalf of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> No, you shouldn't - you don't have to do that, you were there on your version when everything was planned and executed etc., did they do anything wrong that necessitated them ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But he wasn't there, he said that from the time of the abduction he had nothing further to do with it, he doesn't know what the other black people did after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Mr Chairman, I'm just referring to the Vlakplaas black members who were present during the first meeting, the second meeting and this particular witness, he was present then, and the abduction.  Those are the only three incidents that I'm referring to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And they remained, didn't they, they didn't all come back, only two others came back with him, to C.R. Swart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well Mr Chairman, that's another question that we have to canvass with this witness, I'll just ask him that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a>	Mr Ramatala, when Mr Bhila was then put into the other Combi at what stage did the other black members arrive at C.R. Swart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I said earlier as I remember seeing Mhieza and Lembedi, Lembedi opening the door, the front seat door immediately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> No, I don't understand your question, your answer, you testified that Mr Bhila was then handed over to - well you can't recall whether Mr McCarter was there but he was then taken in this Combi and he was carted away.  When did you for the first time after that see the other black members?  After Mr Biela had been handed over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> The first one I saw is Letsatse when he came and fetched the keys to us in about ten to fifteen minutes and others I saw them late.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> You also made mention of the fact that you weren't paid a bonus for this particular operation, what was the custom at Vlakplaas in respect of bonuses and amounts that were paid after operations had been carried out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> The bonus was a way of encouraging them to work to identify seriously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> But is it not true that there were proper structures for members of Vlakplaas in terms whereof they would be rewarded if weapons were found, like AK47's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1572"><a name="pos1572"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And the same applied for arrests of so-called terrorists and the idea was never that Vlakplaas members would be compensated for killing people at random?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1573"><a name="pos1573"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Can you repeat it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1574"><a name="pos1574"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> I'm just saying on this question of compensation, isn't it true that you were never compensated just for the sake of killing people, you had to go and arrest terrorists or so-called terrorists and or find weapons like AK47's etc?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1575"><a name="pos1575"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> You see when talking about this issue of compensation, the whole group of Vlakplaas, all of them they cannot be involved in ...[indistinct] or killing one person, there maybe can be two people or three people involved.  Others don't know about that when coming to a mere arrest where others can make a trip, others can watch or keep or still like that but bonus we used to get.  But even those who were killed, who kill, they used to get the bonus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1576"><a name="pos1576"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Ja, but you were never told by Mr de Kock and or other people at Vlakplaas to your knowledge that you would be paid if you go and kill people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1577"><a name="pos1577"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But Mr Hugo that wasn't his evidence, he talked about performing a specific function or instruction and then bonuses would ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Afterward yes ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a>	Then Mr Ramatala, you also made mention of a photo that was shown to you, where did this photo come from and I'm referring to the first meeting, the first order group meeting when you were initially instructed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I can say that one from Mr Mhieza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> I have no further questions, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1582"><a name="pos1582"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR HUGO</p>
<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a>	Can you just press - thanks.  Please don't touch it, leave it like that.  Now for the sake of information, these bonuses that were paid to you, were they fixed bonuses or you received varying amounts at different times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Well if you say ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> ...[inaudible] to others, maybe the group there were five, can be 2000 or 3000 each.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And as far as you are aware, did Mr Makata - I'm sorry I'm used to Makata the football player.  Makata, did he at any stage discuss with you this question of bonuses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Okay.  The impression that you gained about these bonuses was it that it was the practice of Vlakplaas or it applied to all the security branches in South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, the practice of Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Alright.  Now the members of the Durban branch security, Wasserman did you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> That one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1595"><a name="pos1595"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1596"><a name="pos1596"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And Taylor?  Major Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes</p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And during your stay in Durban, during this period when Bhila was killed, did you discuss any operation with Mr Wasserman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And with Mr Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> They were higher up you had no contact with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> I see.  Thank you Mr Chairman, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1605"><a name="pos1605"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NGUBANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1606"><a name="pos1606"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> There's no re-examination thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> There's just one aspect on the issue of bonuses.  Would you say that it was the practice at Vlakplaas to - let me say, would you say that the killing of a person was an act which was so serious that it warranted the payment of a bonus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I have never been in the killing at first place in Vlakplaas but on arresting , getting some firearms, there was a bonus but for those who were involved in the killings, it's only now we can see that their bonus was too much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Do you perhaps know how much they would be paid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1610"><a name="pos1610"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No I don't know but it's only now from the Truth Commission we start to hear that oh, this one used to get this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1611"><a name="pos1611"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> But at the time that you were at Vlakplaas, you never knew how much people would be paid for the killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> The killing of a person is a very difficult thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1614"><a name="pos1614"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> It doesn't involve the whole group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1616"><a name="pos1616"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> There were particular persons who are going to be involved so those two or three people, they are the ones that know the bonuses, how much they received.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1617"><a name="pos1617"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Would you say that this payment of bonuses would be something that would make it easier or be an incentive on the people at Vlakplaas to kill more easily than other branches?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Not necessarily to kill but to stimulate them to work - we were dealing with people who were former ANC members so sometimes as a human being I might - presume that I'm an ANC member - I might see you, maybe I say: "Comrade I don't report or I don't arrest you" but the bonuses was the way of making the person to feel like arresting anybody, that he knows exactly this one is from that side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1619"><a name="pos1619"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Yes. Again I understand with the askaris or the people who had defected from the liberation movements, but when it comes to the police themselves, the people who had not defected, would you say that the killing, the payment of bonuses would add an extra incentive for those people to kill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Can you repeat your question please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Alright, I'm referring to policemen, people who had not come from the liberation movement, would you say that this payment of bonuses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1622"><a name="pos1622"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> The bonus, you mustn't take as if it was my suggestion for the bonuses but I say that it was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1623"><a name="pos1623"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Yes, that's why I want to find out from you because you were there at Vlakplaas, you knew ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1624"><a name="pos1624"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> But I didn't participate on killing somebody to receive the bonus of killing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1625"><a name="pos1625"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1626"><a name="pos1626"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Maybe that one I might not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1627"><a name="pos1627"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> I understand, but I want to get the information from you, from what you know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1628"><a name="pos1628"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> My information concerning the bonus, it can be limited to only firearms, arresting a person, but not for killing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1629"><a name="pos1629"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> In any event, would you say that the payment of bonuses would make people, would make it easier for people to kill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1630"><a name="pos1630"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I want to say again, I said to you the killing of a person it's not an easy thing so all of us - I had never been involved in a killing so the bonuses for getting to arrest these people, getting the firearms, to work very hard.  Maybe I can even say that now, to come to your question, maybe even those who were involved on the killing, maybe the bonus can be the way of trying to make them do that job but I say my information is very limited when coming to that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1631"><a name="pos1631"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Alright, I accept what you say.  If a person could be paid for a job like arresting a person and getting firearms, if you could get a bonus for that, would you agree with me that if anybody killed then definitely that person would get a bonus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1632"><a name="pos1632"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Can you repeat it slowly again so that I can understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1633"><a name="pos1633"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> I'm saying that if a person could get a bonus for arresting a person for getting firearms doesn't it follow that a person who kills will definitely get a bonus for such an act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1634"><a name="pos1634"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Well I agree with you but at Vlakplaas there are more than 400 people there, I think 300 and something they have never been involved on the killing so whether you are at Vlakplaas, but the killing of the human being, it wasn't the thing that has been discussed openly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1635"><a name="pos1635"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Alright, just finally, I mean on that aspect, if somebody who had killed a person who had said to you that he was not paid a bonus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1636"><a name="pos1636"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> You see the bonus you don't sign the S &amp; T form so it's easy to say no I've never received and that some did receive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1637"><a name="pos1637"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Alright, thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1638"><a name="pos1638"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Ramatala, if I understood you correctly, you refer to the bonuses initially simply to tell us that because you didn't receive a bonus you believe this was not a serious terrorist, it was small fry, not a big fish?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1639"><a name="pos1639"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Not a big fish at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1640"><a name="pos1640"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That was the reason why you referred to bonuses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1641"><a name="pos1641"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1642"><a name="pos1642"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then the second question just referring you to your statement again, on the 3rd page under paragraph 9.  It's in Afrikaans now, but you say and this is my paraphrasing in English that you met Bhila for the first time when you were taken to Lamontville with the Combi, that you and two others approached him, you pretended to be members of the UDF ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1643"><a name="pos1643"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1644"><a name="pos1644"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And that he and now this is the operative part - he was under the impression, he was brought under the impression by yourselves that friends wanted to meet with them and that you would take him to the friends to talk to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1645"><a name="pos1645"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1646"><a name="pos1646"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1647"><a name="pos1647"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1648"><a name="pos1648"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now am I mistaken did you not earlier give evidence that you told him that you wanted some, you wanted him to do some things for the UDF, did I misunderstand you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1649"><a name="pos1649"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No I didn't say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1650"><a name="pos1650"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So this is correct, you stand by what is written here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1651"><a name="pos1651"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1652"><a name="pos1652"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And just to get back to that sequence, you said you met with Mhieza again, this is now after the interception when you were slapped around, you went back to C.R. Swart and about 15 minutes later Mhieza fetched the keys?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1653"><a name="pos1653"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1654"><a name="pos1654"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who fetched the key?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1655"><a name="pos1655"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Letsatse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1656"><a name="pos1656"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I'm sorry, did I say Mhieza, I mean Letsatse fetched the key?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1657"><a name="pos1657"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1658"><a name="pos1658"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The others you said you only saw late again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1659"><a name="pos1659"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1660"><a name="pos1660"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How late was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1661"><a name="pos1661"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Round about 5, he went - a minute after the key, he took the keys and left us there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1662"><a name="pos1662"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If you say the others then you mean all the other black members of the Vlakplaas group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1663"><a name="pos1663"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1664"><a name="pos1664"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Alright and Lembedi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1665"><a name="pos1665"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I've never seen him, that was the last time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1666"><a name="pos1666"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You did not see Lembedi again that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1667"><a name="pos1667"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1668"><a name="pos1668"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you didn't see Letsatse leave again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1669"><a name="pos1669"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1670"><a name="pos1670"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he stay at C.R. Swart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1671"><a name="pos1671"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> He stays at C.R. Swart with us, now he came late with others now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1672"><a name="pos1672"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Alright and then lastly Mhieza, did he return with the other group at 5 o'clock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1673"><a name="pos1673"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No, no, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1674"><a name="pos1674"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And when did you see him again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1675"><a name="pos1675"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> I think after four, five days after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1676"><a name="pos1676"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Four or five days after that.  You didn't see him again that same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1677"><a name="pos1677"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1678"><a name="pos1678"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1679"><a name="pos1679"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1680"><a name="pos1680"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, may I enquire whether Mr Ramatala can be excused, there is a flight booked for him later this afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1681"><a name="pos1681"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I take it as in the case of others that if he is required he can be brought back here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1682"><a name="pos1682"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, thank you very much.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1683"><a name="pos1683"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMATALA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1684"><a name="pos1684"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line1685"><a name="pos1685"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, there is no more evidence from the Evidence Leader's side as far as the Bhila incident is concerned at this time.  May we then proceed with the other events?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1686"><a name="pos1686"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Mr Chairman, may I just say that I wasn't going to call any of my clients as witnesses but I'm in your hands in the sense that if the Committee wants them to be here, arrangements can be made but it's entirely up to the Committee.  May I just say that they're still in Pretoria but arrangements can be made for them to be brought down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1687"><a name="pos1687"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Remind me again who they are?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1688"><a name="pos1688"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Mr Chairman they are Mr Willie Malaleka, Mr Radebe, Mr Letsatse and then there is Mr Khumalo whose name hasn't been mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1689"><a name="pos1689"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think at the present stage there's any need to bring them down.  If the need arises I'm sure we can make arrangements with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1690"><a name="pos1690"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> May we then be excused sir, Mr Chairman?  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1691"><a name="pos1691"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Mr Chairman, I do apologise, just one aspect.  In the event of the Commission not calling those witnesses, I was going to ask permission to consult with Mr Hugo in this respect to perhaps get permission to consult with some of those witnesses to see whether we don't want to call them but I will clear that with him before he...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1692"><a name="pos1692"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, would you like a short adjournment now?  What time do you want to leave Mr Hugo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1693"><a name="pos1693"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well my flight is only at 8 o'clock tonight, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1694"><a name="pos1694"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You might have an opportunity to have a word with Mr van Schalkwyk.  Very well, the two of you discuss it and decide what you want or would you like to take a short break and discuss it now rather than make Mr Hugo sitting around waiting here until 4 o'clock?  I'm sure he has been in this hall for quite long enough.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1695"><a name="pos1695"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> I'm very much obliged, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1696"><a name="pos1696"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> We're going to take a short adjournment, please rise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1697"><a name="pos1697"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1698"><a name="pos1698"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line1699"><a name="pos1699"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I'm indebted for the time granted, Mr Hugo has no objection to us consulting with his clients, it's just the logistics of the matter.  Clients are obviously in Pretoria and may I perhaps ask the Commission's indulgence, I do not say that we should interrupt at all, but we'll arrange with Mr Hugo when to consult with these people and I will liaise with Mr Prior as to whether or not we would want to call any of these witnesses at all, but we won't interrupt proceedings at all.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1700"><a name="pos1700"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman, may I with the leave of the Committee also be excused as I believe I will not be involved further in this hearing?  Mr Chairman, if there is a need for either myself of Mr Bosch to return, Mr Prior can contact me and we'll be available.  May I just also place on record, Mr Chairman, I believe that the evidence that Mr Visser is about to lead might also be useful when it comes to argument in the Bhila matter and it might be that I will also make use of that evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1701"><a name="pos1701"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think we had agreed on that, hadn't we, that although they might be handled separately they are all really part of one proceedings and the evidence led in respect of any portion of them can be used in the others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1702"><a name="pos1702"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, may I then be excused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1703"><a name="pos1703"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOLTE:</span> Mr Chairman, if I may place on record, I am Wynand Nolte from the firm Strijdom Britz Attorneys, acting on behalf of Mr F.H.S. Labuschagne who might during the course of these hearings be implicated in the matter.  We're not certain yet.  The extent of his implication is uncertain and will only become clear after evidence has been led in cross-examination.  If I may also place on record the following, neither my client nor our firm has been notified of the possible implication.  We have discussed it with Mr Prior and he has indicated that -well that was last week - that if there was an implication he would let us know.  Because we are uncertain of the extent we would ask the Committee's indulgence, if necessary, to consult with Mr Labuschagne and just adjourn for a short while if there is such an implication?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1704"><a name="pos1704"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is he here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1705"><a name="pos1705"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOLTE:</span> Mr Chairman he is reachable, I have his cell phone number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1706"><a name="pos1706"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You wouldn't have to go far away to look for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1707"><a name="pos1707"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOLTE:</span> No sir, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1708"><a name="pos1708"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, I confirm what Mr Nolte has said, there was no formal notice given in terms of Section 19, but certainly informal notice which has occasioned his presence here and the implication will only arise depending on what some of the applicants will or will not say so it's certainly, his implication didn't appear ex facie the applications as they stand.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1709"><a name="pos1709"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well Mr Chairman, Visser on record, I may add that during the hearing which you attended last week and while we were preparing this case, Mr Chairman, the name of Mr Labuschagne was mentioned and I personally mentioned it to my learned friend Mr du Plessis and Mr Britz and that was how they were informed and I also told them that in the interest of full disclosure we're going to have to tell this Committee that they were involved but that we were not going to implicate him but of course that's not our decision, that's Mr Nolte's decision.  But that's how it came about Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1710"><a name="pos1710"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But anyway he's here now and we can get on with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1711"><a name="pos1711"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, yes indeed.</p>
