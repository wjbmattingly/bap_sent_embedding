<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS KOOVERJEE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>	Mr Andrews, I refer you to bundle A1, page 190 to 194, is that you application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MS KOOVERJEE:</span> Have you been assisted in the completion of this application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS KOOVERJEE:</span> Okay.  You have a statement before you, would you please read it to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>MR ANDREWS</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>"My name is Marcel Trevor Andrews.  I was born in Wentworth on the 3rd of February 1970.  I spent most of my life in the working class township of Wentworth.  I completed matric at Fairvale Secondary in 1988, and that school at a stage was in a dilapidated condition.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>		Immediately after I left school I was employed by Sasol at Secunda in the Eastern Transvaal.  I encountered serious problems with white employees as they were forever wanting to oppress me.  I observed how oppression and apartheid dominated my life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>		I got involved in the Congress of South African Students, together Gasta(?) Sharpley at the beginning of 1984.  At that time COSAS was an affiliate of the United Democratic Front. </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>		We went around the Wentworth area to try and politicise the students to join the Congress of South African Students. </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>		During January/February 1985 (that should read '86) ..."</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say that should be 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So that's</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>"During January/February 1986"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>MR ANDREWS</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>"... I was recruited by comrade Vincent James to become an active member of the African National Congress, within a unit under Commander Robert McBride.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>		At that stage we assisted in politicising the students in the area.  I received ANC material, which I read.  I often listened to Radio Freedom and participated in political discussions at the Allan Taylor residence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>		I refer to my amnesty application.  I have applied for amnesty in respect of Item 13, referred to in bundle A1, page 8, referred to as "Grenade Attack on School Principal Leaf's House", which occurred on the 8th of April 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>		I was arrested for this incident and was to have been a State witness.  However, since both Vincent James and Kevin Curtis pleaded guilty, no evidence was taken from me.  I have not been indemnified for this act, nor have I as yet been charged for it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>		A day or two before the 8th of April 1986, Vincent trained me in the use of handgrenades.  This was theoretical training.  On the day in question and ...(indistinct) 9.30pm, Vincent James, Kevin Curtis and I left the Allan Taylor residence to go to Mr Leaf's house.  I knew Mr Leaf as a member of the Labour Party and also as a police reservist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>		Two handgrenades were used.  I carried one and Vincent James carried the other.  We approached Mr Leaf's house from the back and threw the handgrenades to the front of the house.  There were no injuries and minimal damage to his property.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>		I confirm comrade Robert's submissions on this operation.  We were at that stage concerned the Labour Party supported a State of emergency and cross-border raids.  We understood Mr Leaf as a legitimate target."</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS KOOVERJEE:</span> Thank you, Sir, that is the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS KOOVERJEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Berger, do you have any questions you'd like to put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No questions, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR BERGER</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Dehal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you, Chairperson, just to clarify one aspect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>	Mr Andrews, Mr McBride tells me that the general understanding amongst the comrades in Wentworth and in political circles around Wentworth was that in human rights trials, political trials like the one you were involved in when you became a state witness against your comrades, it was generally done not freely and voluntarily, but under pressure at the hands of the Security Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Is that how you elected - well elected would be the incorrect word, is that how you came to be the State witness in this matter against Vincent James and the other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Well there wasn't like any physical pressure, but I can just maybe explain the circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Briefly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Okay.  I was held alone at Brighton Beach Police Station, in single cells and not being able to communicate with other people and this constantly playing on my mind.  That's exactly the circumstances under which I agreed to lead evidence for the State.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Do I understand you correctly that in return for becoming a State witness you would be relieved of the burden of doing solitary confinement?  Was the promise made to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes, and subsequently being released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> And that you would be released from any incarceration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Prosecutions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> And you would not be held under the specific law under which you were being held at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you, Judge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>	Just briefly again, how old were you at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> At the time of the Leaf incident I was 16 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And when you were in detention you were just slightly over 16?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> That's correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And how long were you in detention for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> I was held in Brighton Beach for over, a little bit over three months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In solitary confinement you say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And was it also widely understood and accepted amongst the comrades that when you participated at the level that you did, openly being seen to be a Security Police witness or a State witness at the behest of the Security Police, that when you are released from custody and you get back to the township you are ostracised, you are rejected by your own people?  And indeed, the accused when they come off, like Mr McBride and his family would have rejected you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Yes.  And that you also feared for your life because when you get back to the township, in those volatile days, death would have appeared to you to have been inevitable, perhaps at the hands of the comrades as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes, I did consider that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And was it not understood that the Security Police were playing this political game where witnesses or comrades are put one against the other and when they are finally released they are killed by each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes.  If I could just state something further on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Mr Dehal, what's the relevance of all this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Simply to indicate ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> What the South African Security Police used to get up to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Sorry, two reasons, Judge.  The first is that when Matthew Lecordier comes in there will be much to be said about his involvement as a State witness in the McBride trial and I was just setting this as a background record to show there's some level of corroboration in that regard.  And whilst the opportunity was here I thought I'll use it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Carry on.  For what it's worth, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Sorry, you were saying something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> This is what I had thought at the time, that at the end of trial I did not lead evidence.  The Security Police had some difficulty in letting me, in releasing me at the end of the trial.  So as a result, when I got back to the community I was not really ostracised by all the comrades and if I could say, I was accepted and embraced by some of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And lastly, the McBride family, especially Robert McBride and you, have reconciled, you have been forgiven and you are all friends again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes, that's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you, very much.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DEHAL</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Dehal.  Mr Richard, do you have any questions you'd like to put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR RICHARD:</span> Yes, Chairperson, a few.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>	At paragraph 1 or section 1, in the second paragraph, you say you attended discussions at the Allan Taylor residence.  My question is, at the age of 16, how did you come to attend those meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Well I was an active member of the Congress of South African Students, I was also an active supporter of the Unit Committee of Concern and the United Democratic Front and as a result we often held meetings at the Allan Taylor residence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> During the period late '85, early '86, were you at meetings there then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now what was discussed at those meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Well I was involved in a number of organisations at that time and we attended meetings there frequently, almost on a daily basis, so I can't really ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Do you recall discussions concerning targets, potential targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> No, we did not discuss anything of that sort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you ever discuss places where there might be concentrations of Security personnel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> No, we did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now you say you joined a unit under the command of Mr McBride, did he give you any training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Mr McBride did not give me any training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when it comes to training, what training did you receive with regard to weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> I only received theoretical training from my comrade, Vincent James.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And what did he ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> In the use of handgrenades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Any other weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you ever discuss with him or get taught by him as to what sort of targets you might throw handgrenades at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> We discussed it, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What was the discussion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Well we discussed that we should attack Labour Party members or police reservists, or any other possible target of which we just discussed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Within the context of those discussions, would a person who had been a police reservist but no longer be active, be considered as a legitimate target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> I don't know if I understand you correctly.  A person who was no longer active in the police reservists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Someone who had been for a while a police reservist but had stopped being active, would such a person be still considered a legitimate target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> I would have considered that person a legitimate target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now if someone's involvement with the Labour Party at the time had insisted on putting up posters during 1983 and been associated with Labour Party members, what would you consider that person to be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> I would have also considered that person to be a collaborator.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And the family of such a person, would they also be considered collaborators?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Had they supported the Labour Party and their policies, yes, I should think that they should also be collaborators.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And if all they had to connect them with the Labour Party was the fact that they were married to somebody who was perceived to be a supporter of the Labour Party, would that be enough to make you consider them to be a collaborator?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Is that now being based purely on the fact that the person was married to a member, or  ...(intervention</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> That's the only factor that you've got.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when you threw the handgrenade at the Leaf house, did you know who was inside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you know the Klein family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes, I knew the Klein family, I was a personal friend of the son of Mr Klein, we grew up together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You grew up with Mr Klein's son, is the import of your answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Yes.  Now does that mean you were often at their house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes, I visited their house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now during which period was it that you visited the Klein house as a friend of their son's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> From childhood as I should say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Until when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> I should think that at the time I became politicised and realised, Mr Klein being a member of the Labour Party and a police reservist and his role in the community, I stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> At about late '83, beginning '84, when I became politicised and joined the Congress of South African Students.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Would you have been aware that inasmuch as Mr Klein was a police reservist, he stopped participating in whatever activity sometime around 1984?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> I was not aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now prior to 1984, what sort of reservist duties did he undertake?  Do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now what did Mr Klein do, to your knowledge, to support the Labour Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> All I know is that Mr Klein was an active member of the Labour Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Would the act of putting up posters to assist the Labour Party in their campaign in 1983 be considered in your mind, to make him an active participant, member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> I didn't see Mr Klein putting up posters or anything like that, but I knew that he was a member, an active member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Do you know what he did in and about the Labour Party's activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> No, I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when you were trained, were you given any criteria as to how to select a target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Well we just discussed it, myself and Vincent and Kevin.  As I said earlier on we discussed amongst ourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was the topic of what civilian or other injuries that you could cause by going on an attack, discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes, we did discuss that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And what was the content of the discussion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Well we discussed as to whether we would want to severely injure someone who could have been at the target and we decided no, we did not want to do that because had we wanted to do that we most probably would have went up to the house and threw a grenade right into, through a window or something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So am I correct in deciding that when you threw the grenade you deliberately didn't throw it through a window so as not to cause personal injuries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And that was in line with and consistent with what you had discussed with Mr James?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> That's correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now when it comes to Mr McBride, was he ever party to those discussions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> No, he was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now before you went on that attack, did you discuss the plan of the attack with anyone else besides Mr James?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> No, it was only discussed amongst ourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And "ourselves" means?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Myself, Mr James and Mr Curtis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Are you aware whether they discussed it with anyone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> No, they would not have discussed it with anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Who obtained the handgrenades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Mr James obtained the handgrenades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR RICHARD</p>

<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Well I matriculated at Fairvale, I studied electronics at Durban Technical College.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> And at the time of the offence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> At the time of the offence I was in standard nine and the Fairvale Secondary School.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> When that handgrenade was thrown, what did you think you wanted to do?  What did you want to attain?  Or why did you throw it there, what were your intentions?</p>

<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> I can understand the political motive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Did you throw just to burn the door, did you want to kill somebody or?  What offence did you intend?  Because it's not clear from your documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Okay.  We wanted to show, I wanted to show the Labour Party that their participation in the tricameral system was unacceptable to the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Thank I can understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Okay, we wanted to frighten them and to ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> You were unaware whether there were any occupants in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> No, I did not know if there was anybody in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> You nonetheless threw the handgrenade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Did it matter whether there was somebody in the house at the time, who would possibly be hurt or killed?  Or would you still in any event have thrown the handgrenade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> We would have thrown it in any event, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Now something of - I just want to know, you and Mr Pearce testified that your attacks would be directed, amongst other people, the Security personnel etc., and members of the Labour Party.  Was your attacked confined to the Labour Party? - when we're talking about collaborators.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Well being in Wentworth we could have, anybody who belongs to any other political organisation that supported the tricameral system ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Would be a target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Yes, I should think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Andrews, when you threw that grenade, where did you throw it, did you throw it against a wall or on the roof or in the garden, down the driveway?  Where exactly did you aim the grenade that you threw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> We threw in the direction of the front, to the front of the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What, in the garden, to land on the yard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Ja, most probably in the yard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said at the time that you were 16 years of age, still very young, was Mr James and Curtis of the same age as you at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> There was a year apart between us.  Mr Curtis was 17 and Mr James was, I think, 18.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And who chose the target, who suggested that Mr Leaf's house become the target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> We decided collectively that, Mr Chairman, that Mr Leaf's house should be the target because of where his house was situated.  That was one of the deciding factors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  Are there any questions arising out of questions that have been put by Members of the Panel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MS KOOVERJEE:</span> None, thank you, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MS KOOVERJEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No questions.  Thank you, Mr Andrews, that concludes your testimony, you may stand down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR ANDREWS:</span> Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MS KOOVERJEE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson, I believe Mr Dehal will now address you with regard to further applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL ADDRESSES:</span> Mr Chairperson, you will notice from the list of witnesses and applicants that Ms Kooverjee and I represent, that what has happened today is I have decided to represent Mr Lecordier and the reason is simply that he falls within the purvee(purview) of the broader spectrum of acts which covers Mr McBride and Ms Apelgren.  Ms Kooverjee has therefore represented Mr Allan Pearce.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>	Now insofar as the remaining persons we represent are concerned, Janet Apelgren who Ms Kooverjee represents, is in Australia.  You heard from Ms Narkedien that she's not here.  Then we've got Derek McBride, who has handed us a statement which Ms Kooverjee intends to read.  We were hoping to do that at the end so that it facilitates the terminal end.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>	Mr Lecordier is here, unfortunately as we all know, he's been in custody.  We've had some difficulties in finalising, I've had difficulties in finalising his statement, principally because we have difficulties in accessing him at prison.  When I got there on various occasions we met with him briefly, but the prison authorities have given us lots of problems, too numerous to mention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>	I'm hoping that I'd have this weekend to finalise his statement.  We have a broad statement, it's multi-paged but I would like to sit with him properly and canvass that so that we don't have any problems when I lead him.  That's really the last witness, apart from everybody else.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>	And on Antonio du Preez, Ms Kooverjee has a statement to read out, like with Derek McBride, but that would be very brief.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>	With Gordon Webster, I will address you later at the end, but I'm making certain endeavours to contact him again.  He's been in touch with me, but unfortunately he's got no funds to be here.  His friends have been phoning me from time to time.  He would have liked to have been here, but I'm now out of touch with him.  I've tried to raise him, I failed to.  I don't know where he is anymore, but I'm hoping that I can raise him this weekend, I've sent messages to him.  And that's where we stand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So are you saying that, with regard to getting in touch with Mr Webster, you may or may not call him as a witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Sorry, correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, so basically what you're saying is you want an adjournment now until Monday morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Insofar as Matthew Lecordier is concerned, yes, otherwise we could round up the rest of the witnesses.  Sorry, with Matthew Lecordier, I would like to consult with him in prison this weekend, settle his statement and then start on Monday morning and I'm pretty sure we'd be over with him by Monday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So what would you propose to do today then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> For present we cannot take the matter any further insofar as Ms Kooverjee and I are concerned.  I would be not be objectionable to any witnesses testifying at this stage, if the rest of the Panel Members and the parties are agreeable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Witnesses not called by yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> None by myself, yes.  But insofar as I am concerned, yes it would be correct that if any witnesses or other persons are not called, I will seek an adjournment till Monday morning, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, we would have no problem if some of the victims wanted to testify now and perhaps we could save some time, instead of adjourning early.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you don't intend calling any further witnesses yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, we have no further witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Kooverjee, do you just associate yourself with what Mr Dehal has said, or is there anything further you'd like to add?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MS KOOVERJEE:</span> Nothing further, thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Richard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I've no problem with what's been said, but my clients have always indicated that they would like to give evidence at the end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, well we're not going to force anybody to give evidence when they don't want to give evidence and it's usual that they give evidence at the end, although if they want to give evidence now that would also be acceptable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I will canvass their point of view, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, I don't at this stage have any specific witness in mind.  There are a few loose ends dealing with statistics and other information that if there's no agreement thereto, I might have to lead some evidence.  In principle I have no objection to the proposal of Mr Dehal, save to possible say while Mr Lecordier is here, he could properly use the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Use the time here rather than battling with, as you said you have in the past, the prison authorities in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I'm indebted to you.  In fact we managed to get five minutes yesterday afternoon and then the prison authorities vehicle arrived and they were husked away.  I presume if we adjourn at about this time or shortly hereafter, I'd be able to get the time.  Remember it's  a Friday and ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Well perhaps you can have longer because 4 o'clock seems to be significant to prisons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I agree.  Except today is Friday and I think the prisons have something about Friday and closing early as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In any event, I'm sure an arrangement can be made because we are in the middle of the hearing and we don't need their red tape or bureaucracy or whatever to interrupt it, there must be a little bit of flexibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Then I'd propose that if the Panel made a ruling in a sense, that Mr Lecordier be available for the rest of today until whatever time to consult.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Certainly, I'd go along with that, I think that would be the most convenient.  Because I presume Mr Dehal, you've reserved the day for this matter.  Mr Lecordier is here, it's probably a better situation, better circumstances to consult in in this environment rather than in prison.  I would therefore direct that you be given an opportunity to consult with Mr Lecordier at least up until 4 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I'm indebted, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, sorry, there's one other matter.  Whilst in the past we've allowed statements to be read out, it's also proper I think that copies of those statements be circulated, particularly through the Evidence Leader, that we can assess the information in that statement before it's actually just read out onto the record without any particular warning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you mean "to assess"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> ...(inaudible) to know whether that information is going to assist the hearing or contribute to the applications serving before you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you mean, statements from applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> It was indicated that Mr Derek McBride's statement was going to be read out, we don't know what it says ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh sorry, I thought you meant like Exhibits P, Q and R, which is basically the evidence that they're leading.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> No, I'm referring to persons not appearing before the Committee and wish to have statements read out to them.  I'm simply asking Mr Dehal that we have sight of those before that stage, or ample sight so that we can also consider what information they seek to place before the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I have no difficulty with that, Mr Chairperson.  My only difficulty is, I'm waiting for it to be finalised and properly signed etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Dehal.  What I'd suggest now is perhaps we can take an adjournment, I see it's nearly tea time.  Mr Richard, you can speak with your clients, find out if anyone wishes to give any evidence now or make a statement, they may do so.  If they prefer to do so later, after the evidence has been led by all the applicants, then that is quite acceptable.  You can also indicate to them that the victims have a choice, they can either decide to give evidence, take the oath, in which event the other legal representatives will be given an opportunity to put questions if they want, or else to just come and make a statement as such, in which event they'll just make their statement without being subjected to questioning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I will convey they have the options of giving evidence under oath and being questioned, or making an ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A statement or whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What I was going to add on, and it's for the benefit of the victims as well, there is a process going on and I would like the opportunity right now to discuss with them the further continuation of what is afoot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you very much, Mr Richard.  So at this stage we'll take the an adjournment and then if you can just let us know what's going to happen, then we'll come in very briefly.  If nothing further is going to happen, if there's not going to be any statements or evidence, then I will formally postpone the matter to Monday, but we'll come in and do that here or else we'll come back to hear evidence or a statement, whatever the situation.  Thank you.  We'll now take the tea adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Richard has asked to be excused.  He's with the victims at the moment.  What's been decided is simply we're going to adjourn now, just the adjournment, and he's asked to be excused.  I said I would convey anything that arose here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you, Mr Prior.  So then is it agreed we'll adjourn until Monday when we expect the evidence of Mr Lecordier to be proceeded with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DEN BERG:</span> Mr Chairperson, before you proceed.  Mr Berger and I had raised with you in chambers yesterday whether we might be excused.  The arrangement I have with Mr Prior is that this matter will be argued on Wednesday and we ask that we might be excused until then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DEN BERG:</span> ...(inaudible - no microphone)</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I don't know how long it's going to take, but if it's going to be Wednesday, that would be fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Perhaps you'd better prepare for Tuesday also.  I don't see Mr Lecordier being longer than the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But we don't know whether or not there's going to be any witnesses or victims.  What happens if Mr Lecordier's finished, let's say by lunchtime or whatever, you know if evidence is finished early?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, my sense of it is that Mr Lecordier plus whoever might give evidence after, will take a day, which leaves us basically a day, Tuesday, to consider all the evidence, prepare Heads of Argument and argue the matter.  Obviously I'm open, if the Committee says we do it on - I'm just thinking of the preparation time, that one's not rushed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prior, there's no other witness besides any victims that might be giving a statement or evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I'm not anticipating it at this stage.  Well, as I indicated we're still getting the list and that information, but I'm sure we can, between the parties, come to some arrangement as to background information.  No, so from the Commission's side I don't intend calling anybody, it's just the victims who are presently engaged with ... I understand from Mr Richard, and I was with them at the adjournment, that several of them wanted to address the Committee and give evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Mr van den Berg, would it be possible that if there was some sort of communication with you on Monday, that you could be here Tuesday afternoon sort of thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DEN BERG:</span> Yes certainly, Mr Chairperson, we would be ready to argue as soon as whatever statements and evidence has been adduced on behalf of the victims, be that Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning. We're in your hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  No well I think if we can do it on that basis because it might well be Wednesday, depending on how long we take and also there might be a bit of time required to finish off the preparations for argument or whatever.  But then on the other hand, if it does occur a bit earlier, if Mr Prior could communicate with you and give you of course reasonable notification of when we'll proceed.  But from what it sounds like it will in all probability be Wednesday.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>	So at this stage then, Ladies and Gentlemen, because we're not in a position to receive any further evidence now - as you heard Mr Dehal has to finalise his consultations with the next applicant who's giving evidence, namely Mr Lecordier, he's asked for an adjournment until Monday, everybody's in agreement with that adjournment, so we will then adjourn until Monday morning at this venue at 10 o'clock.  Thank you.</p>
