I will warn you here though that if it's not heard on Wednesday it may have to stand over to Thursday or till Friday.  We will certainly endeavour to dispose of it next week but I don't propose to adjourn it till the Monday because I think you should be given the time to prepare, rather than have to rush through it again.
