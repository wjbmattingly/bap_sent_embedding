<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning, we want to start the proceedings.  It is for the record, Thursday, the 2nd of September 1999 and we are continuing with the amnesty applications of Vermeulen and Nofomela in respect of Chesterville.   Ms Patel, if my memory serves me correctly, you were still busy questioning Mr Vermeulen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">NICOLAAS VERMEULEN:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please be seated.   Yes, Ms Patel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS PATEL:</span> (cont)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>	Thank you Honourable Chairperson.   Mr Vermeulen, are you ready?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Fine, thank you.  Just to recap on yesterday, if I understand your testimony correctly, you and the rest of the members from Vlakplaas came up to Durban to assist with the unrest in the area.  You and Nortje, Willie Nortje, at some stage went to the police station or the army base as you say, to meet Mr Hunter, Lt Hunter, who pointed out Chesterville as the area in which there was trouble and that a possible, you know that that was one of the areas that you could concentrate on and based on that information, you then went with Mr Nortje, Mr Bosch, Mr McCarter, Mr Radebe together with some of the other askaris, you went to the graveyard first.  Is that correct so far, am I right so far in my summary of what had happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, that is how I recall it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, then you went to the graveyard, Radebe and the askaris were given instructions to go and infiltrate, they went in, came back some time later and requested an AK47 which was then handed to them.  They then left.  You then moved off to the bridge which was meant to be the second meeting point.  Whilst you were there, you heard some gunshots going off.  Mr Radebe and company came back, reported that there was a shoot-out or a "skermutseling" as it was stated and you all went off to C R Swart police station where Mr Nortje then went and made a report to Mr de Kock about the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.  Now let me start off with Mr Nortje's statement, I have managed to trace the statement that was made Honourable Chairperson, it is in fact before you, it is headed "Willem Albertus Nortje, SAP Pretoria" and it is dated the 27th of June 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we've got that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> All right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you want that to be marked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Exhibit B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Exhibit B?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> All right, thank you Honourable Chairperson.   Mr Vermeulen, if I can just take you through the information that is contained in the statement and ask for your comment on that in so far as it relates to the testimony that you have already given us.   Mr Nortje says that on the 15th of June 1986 they already received information and as a result of that information, they then went to Durban.   The purpose of going to Durban as he states in the first paragraph of the statement was</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>"... the investigation was regarding security matters and tracing AK47s and handgrenades."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>	What is your comment on that, can you recall that this information was available to you before you in fact went to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I, myself, cannot recall it because at that stage, I was not a Section Leader, Mr Nortje was the Section Leader and most of the information would have been given to him.  He would have come back to us on a later stage, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.  He also states further that Lt van Dyk, I would imagine that would be Paul van Dyk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Was in charge of the operation.  Did you bear any knowledge of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> He could have been there, I won't dispute it, but he wouldn't have been in charge, because Col de Kock was in charge of the unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> No, not of the unit, of this operation?  Is it possible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> It is possible, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay fine, and he says that Lt van Dyk gave him certain information and then told him to get in touch with Lt Hunter who was in fact the person who gave further information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.   He then says that they gathered the men, he gives a list of the group that was with, and then you first went to Chesterville at about eleven o'clock that evening, and then stopped at the bridge or as he says "under the bridge", that the askaris were left there, it is only Mr Radebe and the white members who then went from there to meet Lt Hunter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, that is correct.  I think I stated that in my testimony yesterday Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> If I recall your testimony correctly, and as I have summarised it to you this morning, that it was only after the meeting with Lt Hunter that you then all moved off to Chesterville, whereas Lt Nortje says here that you first went to Chesterville, dropped off the men and then went to meet Lt Hunter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct, we first went - what I stated yesterday, we first went to Chesterville, to that army base camp to get the information about Chesterville and then we went back, it was just the whites and one black, Radebe, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Hunter was in fact in Chesterville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but if I understood your evidence correctly, you testified that it was on the basis of the discussions at the police station or the army base that it was decided that you had to infiltrate Chesterville, in other words you said that was how it happened.  If the information was to this regard, you could have started at another point, the information you obtained during the discussions ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> If I brought the Committee under a wrong impression, I beg your pardon, but I am certain I said that we first went to this army base or the police station, there we looked at the map, they indicated that Chesterville was a flash point, we returned and from there the members were posted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In other words based on the briefing you received at the army base or police station whatever, you decided on Chesterville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, but on the information that Lt Hunter gave to us, we moved to Chesterville.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, sorry Ms Patel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Thank you Honourable Chairperson.   In that regard, let me refer you to Lt Hunter's statement, Honourable Chairperson, that is also in front of you, can we mark that Exhibit C, I think?  He says the contrary, if you look at paragraph 3 of his statement, well, let's start with paragraph 2, he says a group of you came to him and he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>"... there were various white members and one black member."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>	Right, and then in paragraph 3 he states that Nortje, well, he doesn't mention Nortje's name specifically in paragraph 3, but he says the group, meaning you, you in the plural, having come there, requested information from him specifically on a certain Charles Ngcobo.  It is not the other way around, it is not a question of Hamilton having provided information generally about the unrest and sending you to Chesterville, it is about your group coming there, requesting specific information about a specific person.  What is your comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Mr Chair, that information could have come from Willie, that he got it from Mr van Dyk or wherever, but he didn't discuss it with us.  I will say that was still his own information that he had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> But you were present with him during the discussion with Lt Hunter, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> According to you, those discussions revolved primarily around Lt Hunter explaining to you that Chesterville was a hot-spot in terms of unrest, and not the other way around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct, that is why we went to the army base camp, Mr Chair, to find out which place would be a hot-spot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Furthermore, well, it is also confirmed in the statements that the certain Charles was in fact a leader of the comrades group at the time and the information was that he was in possession of an AK47 as well as handgrenades?  Do you recall this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> It could have been, I won't dispute it Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.   The weapon, the AK47, it is Mr Nortje who made an application for that to be issued, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> As far as I know, yes Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, to confirm this Honourable Chairperson, there is in fact another Exhibit before you, that would be Exhibit D, it is an application by Sgt Nortje to the Commander of C-Section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it a hand-written document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> It is a hand-written document, it is dated the 03-06-1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we've got that one.  Will that be Exhibit D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, it is an application for the issue of an AK47 and in motivation of this application, Sgt Nortje states in paragraph 2 of the application</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>"... this weapon is required to ensure the credibility of a team who will be responsible for the infiltration at a group ANC terrorists in the Port Natal area."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>	It appears from this paragraph, you will agree with me, that the question of an infiltration had already been decided as early as the 3rd of that month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, that could have been, otherwise we wouldn't have come here.  The infiltration could have been any place.  That is actually why I think we came down to Durban area, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> All right, and furthermore just to highlight the fact that he notes that it is the infiltration of a group, it seems to me that the only reasonable inference that one can draw from that is that there was information about a specific group that was to be infiltrated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I cannot comment on that Mr Chair, it might have been information that Willie had before the time, when he applied for the weapon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> You will agree thought that it ties in with Lt Hunter's version that it is in fact the group that requested information about a specific person, from him, rather than him providing general information about Chesterville at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> It can be so, yes, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Maybe before you move from that Ms Patel, when one reads paragraph 2, one gets also the information that this AK47 was supposed to be used to convince the group about the trustworthiness of the people who had infiltrated them, do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> In other words as early as the 3rd of June 1986, it was decided that the AK47 was going to be used to convince the UDF members that the people who were infiltrating them, were comrades as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> That will contradict what we heard yesterday that only when the askaris and Radebe started talking to the UDF members, they suspected that they were not comrades and at that stage, Radebe had to go out, ask for an AK47 from you people to go and pretend that he is a comrade, do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I agree Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> So that will also support Mr Nofomela's evidence that the AK47 was obtained in Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Pretoria at Headquarters, yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Okay, thank you Mr Vermeulen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Thank you Honourable Chairperson.   Just to confirm now that we have the affidavit in front of us, Sgt Nortje says that it is in fact a Shey 77 weapon or firearm, which he says looks like or is similar to an AK47 that was handed over to Sgt Radebe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Can I just comment there Mr Chair, this Shey I think there is a spelling fault there, what actually must be just there is a CH77 which means the weapon was made under licence in Czechoslovakia, but it looks exactly the same as an AK47, it shoots the same bullet, it looks exactly the same, there is actually very few discrepancies on the weapon itself, I just think that was a small fault there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Oh, okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> It is page 2 of Nortje's statement, paragraph ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which Exhibit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it Exhibit B?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> B, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And on the second page you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> The second page, paragraph 6, Honourable Chairperson, the last line.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From the top?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Number six?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh, yes.  Sorry, yes, we've got that thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> All right, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Mr Vermeulen, you are saying that this weapon is similar to an AK47?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This CH77, is that the reference for that weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, sorry Ms Patel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Thank you Honourable Chairperson.   Are you certain that Sgt Nortje reported to Mr de Kock after the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Were you present during the report back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> He doesn't say, Sgt Nortje doesn't mention this at all in his statement, in Exhibit B, all he says is that he then made a report to Lt Hunter and then after that, he made a report to Lt van Dyk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman, Mr van Dyk and Col de Kock slept in the same room, so when they came in, both of them woke up and Col de Kock automatically heard what was going on as being the Chief of the unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> So are you saying that Mr de Kock just, no - I think I misunderstood your information, correct me if I am wrong, are you saying that Mr de Kock just by the way happened to be in the room where the report back was made to Lt van Dyk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> He was in his sleeping quarters at the Officers' Mes at C R Swart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Who is he now, are you referring to Mr de Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Mr de Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> And Mr de Kock and Mr van Dyk shared the same room at C R Swart and that is where the report was made to Mr de Kock, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> And as far as you are concerned, Lt van Dyk just happened to be in the same sleeping quarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No, they booked in at the same room, it wasn't by chance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> No, but the intention wasn't to report back to Lt van Dyk, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, that is what I mean.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> All right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To whom was the report actually made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> According to me it was reported to Col de Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Nortje spoke to Mr de Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where was van Dyk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Van Dyk was in the same room, they were together in the same room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was van Dyk sleeping?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> As far as I can remember, it is difficult to say now, but at that stage he was sleeping, they shared the same room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did they wake Mr de Kock up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, we first woke up Mr de Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you woke up Mr de Kock, not van Dyk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Not van Dyk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was van Dyk still sleeping?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I cannot remember that Mr van Dyk was there when we told Mr de Kock about the shooting, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Ms Patel, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Thank you Honourable Chairperson.   Sorry, if you will just grant me a moment, I just need to double check something, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Mr Vermeulen, can you recall whether Sgt Nortje took the weapons away from the askaris after the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No Mr Chairman, I cannot recall that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.   From what you can recall, immediately after the incident, the shooting had taken place, you were all under the bridge and you say that Sgt Radebe then came and reported to Nortje that a shooting had taken place and he wasn't certain whether anybody was injured or not and then you all moved off to C R Swart from there, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is how I recall it, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.  If I can take you to Nortje's application to us, it is part of the Bundle, it is page 23, paragraph 11, he states here that they, and he is obviously referring to Radebe and the rest</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>"... they told me that they had shot five people and that they did not know whether all of them had been killed."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>	Now if the shooting had taken place from outside of this room or the shack that it was, and the members had left immediately, how would they have known that five people were shot at, without ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I cannot comment on that Mr Chairman, because I wasn't at that stage there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> But you are certain that all that Radebe said to Mr Nortje was that there was a shoot-out and they don't know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> As far as I can recall, yes, those were the words Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> All right, and just, you don't know, you don't have any recollection of Charles Ndaba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No Mr Chairman, only when it came up was when I discussed it with Willie the day before yesterday, before we came down, it is the first time that the name came up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Because it appears that the Charles Ndaba that he refers to, that Willie refers to in his application to us, is quite possibly a mistake and that it is meant to be Charles Ngcobo, which is the person who is referred to by almost everybody else in the papers before us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That can be so Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Do you recall whether there was ever a discussion, sometime after this incident, about Aubrey Mogadi having become nervous during the operation and he let his Uzi firearm go off by mistake and that is what started the skirmish?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No Mr Chairman, not that I can recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Do you recall whether Aubrey Mogadi would have had an Uzi weapon with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No Mr Chairman, I cannot say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Sorry, you cannot say whether he would or wouldn't have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No, I cannot say which weapon he had at that stage when the shooting commenced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.  Would askaris generally be issued with Uzi weapons, from your knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> It all depends on what type of operation - they could have been issued with anything.  But Aubrey wasn't an askari, he was a member of the Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Oh, all right, okay.  Would the normal member of the Force, would he have been issued with an Uzi weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> As part of his normal duties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No, not normal duties, but it is normal practice in our unit that every vehicle gets a certain weaponry for certain operations, because we did urban terrorism and also out in the "platteland", so each bus would have been issued a certain type of weapons to comply with the operation that is on the go, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Where would these weapons come from, would it have been brought with from Vlakplaas or would you have gotten them in Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That would have been a Vlakplaas issue, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> And who would have arranged that, to whom would an application have to be made for the issue of those other weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No, there was no application to be made because that was a standard issue to every bus, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> By every bus, you mean every vehicle that departs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Every kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Every kombi that departs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, the driver would have been responsible for the weapons and ammunition, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.  Just generally, what other types of weapons would have been issued?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> It could have been a shotgun, it could have been Uzi's, it could have been grenades, it could have been smoke-grenades, it could have been teargas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> And would that type of weaponry be taken with if the intention is just an infiltration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> It would always be in the vehicle Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Oh, regardless of the nature of the operation, that is standard issue that you take with when you leave Vlakplaas, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Would those weapons be kept in the vehicle at all times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> An Uzi, is this a so-called terrorist weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No Mr Chairman, it is a South African standard issue weapon, it is a standard issue at the police and the army, it is a 9mm weapon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Ms Patel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Thank you Honourable Chairperson.   You don't know what weapons the rest of the group that went into the infiltration, what weapons they had in their possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> If I may speculate, it will be their own ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> No, I don't want you to speculate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> The weapons that they would have had with them, would have been their issued SAP weapons, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.   And the standard issue would be what, a 9mm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> A 9mm Baretta or a 9mm P38.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> P38?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct, Walter P38.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, can I - in this operation, who would have been in control of the weapons for the van that you were in at the bridge?  Would it be Willie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Willie Nortje, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, and the other van, or the other - there were two other vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> The kombi would have been Simon Radebe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Would he have been in charge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Because his vehicle, he was in charge of his vehicle and he would have been in charge of the weapons as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, and there was one more vehicle on the scene.  You said there were three vehicles that departed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> The third one is, I have been thinking Mr Chairman, I can't place it properly.  I cannot recall exactly what happened to that vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Are you saying it might not have been there at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I would actually rather, yes, because I have been thinking and I can only recall one vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.   This operation took place in the early hours of the morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> You were given instructions by, your group was given instructions to leave the Durban area that very day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Did Willie and Sgt Radebe depart with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I cannot recall that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Do you know whether they departed at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I am quite sure they departed, but they did not depart with me, I think I left in a different vehicle, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> As far as you can recall, was there any reason given for your departure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Not as far as I can recall Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Did you not find it strange that you came there to assist in tracing persons who had killed policemen and here after a very short stay, after one aborted infiltration, you are asked to leave the area, did you not find that strange?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No, it is not strange Mr Chairman, that happened on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Also where the members acted in self-defence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I don't think that would have been the case, but as I have been asked, it was not strange that you were only deployed for one day and then you were removed right to the other side of the earth, that was not strange at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But that was a flash point, Chesterville was a flash point according to all indications, the members infiltrated, they act in self-defence, that is legitimate and justified, and then that was the end of the operation and then you just give up on Chesterville, you don't even try to find out anything more at Chesterville, who was responsible for this flash point?  Was that a normal procedure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> This was nothing extraordinary.   I think a week or two weeks before the time, we were also in Durban and we also stayed for a day or two and we returned, that was not strange at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you weren't worried about the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That was ordinary practice to go in, and then you returned home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> The next day we went to a different place, I think some people went to the border of Swaziland the next day, if I can remember correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was no attempt to get away from the shooting incident, to keep your members out of trouble?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No, there was no problems experienced in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Ms Patel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> If it in fact was the case that there was a need to get your members out of the area, perhaps because or possibly because the operation had gone wrong and there wasn't in fact a question of self-defence, would you in your position in your rank at Vlakplaas, during this operation, have been informed that this is why we need to leave the area or would that have gone to, would Willie Nortje and Paul van Dyk have been informed of that, would you just have been given instructions to leave and not known why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, I think that will be like it would have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay and then just finally one aspect, you say that Sgt Radebe would have been in control of the weapons in that vehicle, why would he then have to come to Willie Nortje for a weapon to prove his legend, would he not have had his own arsenal of weapons that he could have used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Not like AK47s, no Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> All right, thank you Honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS PATEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Ms Patel.   Mr Vermeulen, in the light of the fact that the members acted in self-defence, did you then immediately return to Chesterville and try and arrest the person who had attacked the members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No Mr Chairperson, we did not go back there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Does the panel have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Mr Vermeulen, initially I was under the impression that apart from the car in which you were travelling, there was the kombi which was driven by Nofomela as well as another car or two additional cars, was that not the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No Mr Chairman.  It was just our vehicle that Willie Nortje was in charge of and then the other vehicle of Sgt Radebe.  That is as far as I can recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You were travelling in the vehicle in which Nortje was in charge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Was Nortje the driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I think so yes, because I think he knew the area better, yes, so he was the driver Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Who else was in that vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> It was my, myself, McCarter and Bosch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Sibanyoni.  Mr Cornelius, any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR CORNELIUS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Vermeulen, if I can refer you to Exhibit B, Nortje's statement then we notice that just after the shooting he says that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>"... we immediately departed to Chesterville police station where a report had been made to Lt Hunter, is that correct?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> So just after the shooting, this incident had been reported to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> This is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And the normal investigation then followed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And the police could then affect arrests on the people who had committed these offences if they deemed it necessary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> I want to refer you to Exhibit D that is today for the first time come under our attention, if one looks at Exhibit D, it would appear as if proper authorisation had been asked for this AK47 rifle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And at sight value it would appear as if you did not necessarily, were in illegal possession of a firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> This is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> This document, Exhibit D, is very interesting in this aspect that it is a request that was made by W A. Nortje to Security Headquarters in Pretoria, so this weapon was not drawn at Vlakplaas?  If one looks at the top it says "C-Section Security Headquarters, Pretoria"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> This is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And if one goes through the document, then in two paragraphs, paragraph 1 says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>"... application is made hereby for the issuing of one AK47 rifle from SHQ (is this Security Headquarters?)"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> This is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And then this also supports the period of the infiltration being 3 June to the 30th of June?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> This is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> So on sight value of this document, this AK was then drawn for a period and not necessarily for one operation or one specific date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And this document also supports that it was a show-piece, something for credibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> This is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And interestingly I note that it was approved by a certain Brig Schoon, this had to be Brig Schoon who was at that stage in control of Security in Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> So this AK47 was legitimately drawn from the police stores?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> This is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> If a clandestine, covert operation had happened, would you  imagine that such documentation would be available, would you expect it to be available and that approval would be sought from Headquarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And then one would rather expect that the weapon would be drawn from Vlakplaas' stores where there would be no record and no documents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> This is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And this document, handed in by Ms Patel this morning, this comes from the police dockets, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I think so yes Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> In other words this document if one looks at Cato Manor, CR27/6/86, then this was probably handed in at the inquest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> It could be the case Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> So if there was anything irregular concerning this AK, then we would have had some action since 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And then questions had been asked about the reasons why Vlakplaas had gotten involved?  It is normal that a request be made by Security at Durban for instance for Vlakplaas' assistance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> According to your knowledge, this was to infiltrate, to get information and then I would assume that this information would be conveyed to Col de Kock and also the overhead operator and also the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> I will now refer you to the Supplementary Bundle - Eugene de Kock and this had been decided Mr Chairperson, that this background study of Vlakplaas would be at your disposal along with the amnesty hearings and this is Exhibit N, this was a Bundle compiled by my learned friend, Mr Schalk Hugo, who handed it in with Justice Wilson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Would this be the same one that C had been at the previous hearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> This is correct Chairperson.  This had been Exhibit C in the previous occasion, I just refer you to two passages.   If you can just allow me a moment, from the report of Gen Coetzee, it appears and I will read on page 9 Chairperson, paragraph 2.1.6</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>"... apparently the idea with this directive (this is a directive that was sent to all the Security Branches in the country), to be able to put the services of this special unit at the disposal of all the Security Branches in the Republic of South Africa."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>	That this is so appears from a follow up directive in January 1982, where the Commanders of the specific Security Branches who had to accept responsibility and also the actions of this unit and also for the area in which they were in command, were asked not to use junior officials and the statement I want to make to you Mr Vermeulen is, is it correct that this Unit Commander of these Security Units who asked for Vlakplaas' services, were responsible for actions in their area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> This is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Would they then have expected that the information coming from this infiltration, would be discussed with the Security Commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> This is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> I think I have put it in your evidence-in-chief, you worked on a need to know basis, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR CORNELIUS</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Cornelius.    Mr Vermeulen, thank you, you are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Cornelius?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, I have no further witnesses that I want to call, this would then be the application of Mr Vermeulen.  I would then argue about what I am applying for exactly, in the light of Exhibit D, that has just come under our attention, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could you please tell us what you are applying for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> I really do not have a base any more, because in this document it is clear that this was a legitimate possession of this weapon, with the approval of Security Headquarters and this took the illegality of it away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Do you want us to issue a licence for it now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> No, thank you.   I understand that this is the basis of my application, that we were in irregular possession, but this document denies it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you say that you want to argue this?  Mr Hugo, do you have any witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, thank you Mr Chairperson.  With your permission I will call Mr Eugene Alexander de Kock as a witness.  May I ask that he be sworn in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">EUGENE ALEXANDER DE KOCK:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, please be seated.  Mr Hugo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR HUGO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Chairperson, an aspect that I would just first like to clear up is the document that I referred to yesterday, this would be Exhibit</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a> A, is the statement of Mr Dlamini and you will recall this is the person who had said that they had arrived there with a kombi.  I was a little bit unreasonable with Mr Nofomela in this aspect that I just accepted that it was the case, when this incident took place, when the people were shot and Mr Dlamini does say on page 3, I saw that this morning -</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>"... on the 21st of May 1986, at 2am ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>	and then he continues and he tells the story.  But from this document it would appear that he just got the date wrong, but the rest of the incident, he describes exactly as it happened and I just was a little bit unreasonable with Mr Nofomela yesterday.  I don't think it makes any difference to the point that is addressed here, but I want to please put this on record just for completeness sake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will note it like this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Mr de Kock,  you have heard the evidence and you have also had insight into some of the documents, can we please start at the beginning, you at the stage when this incident happened, you were Commander of Vlakplaas for about one year, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> You had received information or you had a request that your contingency, the Vlakplaas contingency, should be sent down to Durban, could you please tell us how it happened that Vlakplaas got involved with an operation or operations in Durban during the period that we are talking about now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, before this occasion, on several occasions we had been working in Durban, basically on a monthly basis and we also sent a group of people here.  With this specific incident with our deploying, I received an order from Brig Schoon one morning very early, that the whole unit without exception white and black, had to go to Durban as soon as possible, immediately, and it was as a result of a further two black Security policemen I think, both of them were Warrant Officers, and the Counter-Terrorism section of Taylor, who had been killed, and I think in a question of seven to fourteen days, three of his people had been killed or shot dead in two separate incidents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Can I please refer you, maybe this will help us to move through the evidence quicker, could you please look at Exhibit D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I have it Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> You will see that this is an application that had been made for the issuing of an AK47 rifle, this was done by Nortje and it was approved by Brig Schoon, is this more or less the date on which you had received the request to come down to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And did you have knowledge of the application for this AK47 rifle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson, Mr Nortje made a proposal to me that if we want to infiltrate someone, that we have to prepare for this and be prepared for this and that we had to get an AK47 to take along, that he can take along.  As a result of the hurry that we were in, it wasn't typed out, I said write out an application.  I went along with him to Brig Schoon, Brig Schoon approved it and myself and Sgt Nortje went down to Capt Drury at Security Headquarters on the 6th floor and he was in command of the stores and an AK47 had been drawn there, from Security Headquarters' weapon store where there was about 150 to 200 AKs with magazines and ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Very well, the weapon had then been gotten hold of, and was it put in your vehicle or was it left in the possession of Mr Nortje?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> It was left in the possession of Mr Nortje.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> I accept that the largest part or everyone at Vlakplaas, shortly afterwards departed to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, they departed as soon as they were ready and they had gotten their stuff together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> At what stage did you depart yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I departed later on in that day, I drove on my own, because I had to finish all the administration, the people had to be booked out, reports had to be kept up to date and I departed later.  Quite a lot later, I think I only arrived here that evening late.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> You heard Mr Nofomela's evidence and he said that he had been your driver, and that he drove down with you to Durban, what do you say about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, no, on occasion I did drive on my own and in this case I cannot remember at all that Mr Nofomela had been with me.  I had to get as many as possible black members down specifically because the white people could not go into the black areas, they do not speak the language, they are white.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Very well, and when you arrived in Durban, did you then go and report at the sleeping quarters at the C R Swart police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson, I did.  I made a request that they had to organise a place for me, I cannot remember who I got of my people, they told me that a room had been organised for me in the Officers' quarters and I cannot remember, I did contact Lt van Dyk or I think so, and at a stage, some of the people had already been deployed.  As they arrived here, they were deployed and others were being deployed at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Can I just ask you, if we just quickly look at Exhibit D again, the date of the request for this AK47 was the 3rd of June, if you have to put a date on the time of arrival in Durban, when more or less do you think, did you arrive in Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I cannot say.  I have no independent memory of this.  I really cannot tell you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Nevertheless you had then arrived in Durban and did you then occupy yourself with the organising and the division of certain askari groups and also other members of Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, when I arrived here, some of the members had already been deployed, they apparently just loaded their stuff off, they had already been deployed and others were being deployed as far as I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> What was your function?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Can you please repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> What was your function when you arrived here and you found that the deployment had already been done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I was the Overall Commander.  Lt van Dyk was in command up to that point, I was the Overall Commander and naturally this would be a management function.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> What was your interpretation of the mandate that had been given to the different groups?  The mandate that they had to execute and the functions that they had to execute?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, there was an unknown terrorist and as was mentioned, an ANC terrorist group that was operating, they were unknown. There were no particulars at that point that was available about them that I had received at that point.   They had to be searched for.  There were no specific information that could pinpoint them in a specific area or a house or a suburb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Is it then correct that a whole lot of discretion had been left over to the groups to decide for themselves where these flashpoints would be and then to try to almost on a haphazard way, try and obtain information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, yes, because we did not come from this area, proposals would have come from the Durban Security Branch, specifically from Col Taylor who was part of Counter-Terrorism.  This was as a result of I can almost say looking for a needle in a haystack.  There as I said, was not a specific area that had been pinpointed and this would have been a case of information handled as you received the information on the ground and then the people who were in command there, would then decide how would be continue from here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> If we accept that the application for the AK47 was done on the 3rd of June, and this incident had taken place on the 20th of June, do you have any recollection of what happened in this time?  This would be between the 3rd of June and the 20th of June?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, the people would have continued their search.   I believe that we continued to search until we got information.  You do not stop, you continue, you keep on deploying people in different areas, you do roadblocks, moving roadblocks, you cover the train stations, the bus stations, the taxi stands, you go on recruiting sources and you attempt to gain the necessary information to find the people that you were there for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> We have heard lots of evidence about the ways in which the askaris had been deployed, is it correct that the askaris served under a group leader, normally this would be a black police officer or a black member of the Force, that would then have a couple of askaris under him and that they would then be operating in teams in different areas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson, this is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Would you please tell us with which weaponry were the askaris issued and also the group leader who was a member of the Force, in the normal course of events.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairperson, if I can put it this way, your askari or your former ANC or PAC member had his service pistol which was a P38, it was a 9mm revolver or a Baretta 9mm.  The female staff, or the female staff in the Force would have been white or black, was issued with a .32 Walter pistol because of the fact that their hands were smaller and they had a smaller handgrip and then your group leaders and some of the askaris, of your senior people, were issued with an Uzi or HMK, a sub-machine gun.  Every vehicle that the group leader was responsible for, had a bag, a sail bag and normally this had two R1s with two magazines, two Browning rifles and SSG ammunition and then Uzi's had also been given to them, two Uzi's with four or five magazines each, two sets of handcuffs, between three and four feetcuffs, smoke teargas grenades had been given to them and then also flares and then we also gave them smoke grenades of different colours, if it would be necessary to call in the helicopter.  This bag with all this equipment in , the section leader was in charge of it, if he came back to Vlakplaas, then the weapons would be cleaned and it would be locked up in his personal safe that was issued to him at Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And this would then be so that every group leader had the use of mostly a kombi or one of these mini-buses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> The evening of this incident and we know that, it is common cause that it was the 20th of June, did you know that Messrs Nortje and his team were departing to execute an operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I accept it that I knew.  I cannot remember this far back, but I accept that I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> What had your perception been of the aim of this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> They went in to go and look for terrorists Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Were there other groups during this evening that had also departed to go and look for terrorists themselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> You remained at C R Swart in the Officers' quarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> At some stage, did you go to sleep?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> What happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, the morning early I was woken up, I cannot remember what the time was, it was early in the morning.  Nortje was there, Vermeulen was there and van Dyk was with them.  Nortje told me that our people had been involved in a shooting, people had been killed, not of my people but other people had been shot.  I cannot remember if he gave me a number, he couldn't tell me how many people had been wounded and that it was in the Chesterville area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> What was your reaction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I put on my clothes and I am not sure whether I first went to Chesterville or went into that area or if I went to the nearest police station there, but I did contact Col Taylor because he, on his turn, had to report to the Division Head at Durban of the Security Branch.  I think, I am not sure of this, I think I found him at the police station from where Nortje and them had received the information.  We did wait because they had to send people for us, I think some of the service men of the army had gone with us to go and secure the area.  Chesterville at that point was also referred to as a sort of liberated area, that belonged to the comrades.  I think that a group of the local Investigation Branch had also come along.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And eventually you visited the scene yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> This is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And you also did enquiries with the men regarding exactly what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson, after I had visited the scene, I did do enquiries with them and I was given explanations, but I did not pursue this, the local branch, Inspectors' Branch cordoned off the area and they investigated and the investigation went its normal way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> I don't want you to explain to us what they told you, but you were satisfied from the explanations that you found and that you got, that this was a legitimate operation and that you could leave it in the hands of the police to investigate it further?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> This is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> In this way, after this incident happened, an inquest was also held where extensive evidence had been led and a finding had been made that your people could not be held responsible for this event having happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> This is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Did you, yourself, testify in this inquest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And the evidence was the same as you are giving today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> This is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Mr de Kock, then it is also so that you have applied for many incidents, you applied for amnesty for many incidents, indeed your amnesty application encompasses about more than 1000 pages, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And in this way, you were consulted with for hours by me with the eye on setting up this amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And both myself and you had been properly aware of the Chesterville incident and certain rumours that were being spread?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> This is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And it is also correct that we had spent hours going through documents and that you of your own accord, have decided not to apply for amnesty for this incident, is this correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> This is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And for one very simple reason and this is that you had been convinced of it that you had not committed an offence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> This is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> If you had any doubt that an offence had been committed, then it would have been the easiest thing for you in the world, to just add this to your amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> It would have been no problem at all Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> One last aspect, after this event had happened, how quickly afterwards were Vlakplaas asked or requested to leave the Durban area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I think this would have been a day or two afterwards.  It was not a question of us running away from the area.  I think I still stayed behind for I think a week with a small group of askaris and the rest of the people deployed in the area of Piet Retief, against the North-Natal/Swaziland border and also at the Paulpietersburg/Vryburg area where they were working.  I have a vague recollection of this, but I think this is what happened.  I had still been here for about a week with about six to eight people, as I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And then just to return to the beginning, if one hypothetically speaking accepts that Vlakplaas had already decided in Pretoria to come and kill people, then it would have been the easiest thing for you to take one of the illegal weapons that were in your possession at Vlakplaas or one or more of these weapons, to take this along to the operation and no one would have known about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> We could have brought ten AKs, we could have used all the ammunition,  we could have withdrawn from the area and could have gone to another place and it wouldn't have been a problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Would you then get an AK on a legitimate basis just because you wanted to use it as a show-piece?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson, this AK was the property of Security Headquarters, it came from their stores.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Thank you Chairperson, we have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR HUGO</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Hugo.    Mr Ramawele, have you got any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR RAMAWELE:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, I do have questions.  I am going to start to refer the hearing to the Supplementary Bundle - Eugene de Kock, it is the Bundle which was referred to by Mr Cornelius, thank you.  I refer to page 14.   Mr de Kock, here in your affidavit you say, you can just confirm if this is true, you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>"... as the Commanding Officer of a Koevoet Unit, in the previous South West Africa, I developed a reputation of a very harsh tracer of the so-called terrorists."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a>MR RAMAWELE:	"... I had no formal training as a Security Policeman and I had no practical experience of investigative work regarding Security matters."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>MR RAMAWELE:	"... and for all practical purposes, I was only a trained soldier in an armed struggle against SWAPO."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Furthermore you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>"... most of the members including myself, were better trained for operations of military nature."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Then further on you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>"... these members, like myself, were already not any more susceptible for violence and human suffering because of all the violent deeds in which we participated and to which we were exposed to during our service period in the previous mentioned units."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>	Later on you say -</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>"... these had to be people who would not hesitate from danger and would not hesitate to combat the terrorist threat by killing people."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>	Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You heard yesterday, it was suggested to Nofomela that you could have, you might have been wishing to protect him when you said that, or you may have wanted to protect him, you know, such a suggestion was made, did you hear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> In the light of what I have just read to you and also - in the light of what I have just read to you, do you think  really that a member of C1, of Vlakplaas, would be protected in the sense that you would say he should not get into a situation where he has to fight the so-called terrorists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson, certain people had to be used for certain tasks.  Certain people were more suitable for specific tasks, some people were not suited for cross-border operations for example and then you would have used people who were more suited.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> In this instance I am talking about Mr Nofomela, would you say that Mr Nofomela was not, was a person who had to be protected from getting into Chesterville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No, he was not protected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> In other words what you are saying is that Mr Nofomela was quite able and - was quite able to get into Chesterville and carry out the instructions if he was instructed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson, I mean - Nofomela when I arrived in Vlakplaas in 1983, had already been a murderer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Why do you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, when I arrived there in 1983, they had already told me about the Griffiths Mxenge situation and he was also involved in the shooting at Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Okay.  Now, why did you go to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ramawele, I assume you are moving to another point now?  I am going to take the adjournment and then you can deal with the new point when we come back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will reconvene at half past eleven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">EUGENE ALEXANDER DE KOCK:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ramawele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR RAMAWELE:</span> (continued)   Thank you Mr Chairman.   Mr de Kock, was it the whole of Vlakplaas that went to Durban on this particular mission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Why was it the whole of Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Because that was the instruction from Brig Schoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Did he tell you why was the whole of Vlakplaas supposed to go to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Because we had to trace these terrorists which killed the policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> So are you telling the hearing that the purpose of your visit to Durban was to trace the people who killed the police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That was to trace the terrorists, to arrest these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> After tracing them, you would then arrest them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Are you saying after arresting them, obviously then they have to appear in court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Not necessarily Chairperson, to arrest could also mean to kill them and it did not necessarily mean that they would appear in court, as a lot of the askaris, they decided after some time to turn to the police and provided a service to the police.  That was the situation ... (no interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> How long were you based at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> From 1983 Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Until when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Until 1993 Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Have you ever appeared in court to testify about whatever you have done in respect of the activities at Vlakplaas, I mean at the time when you were still in charge of Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson, I appeared in court at various instances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I see.   Now, the sole purpose of going to Durban, was to trace the so-called terrorists who killed police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You were in charge of the operation?  You were in charge of the operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And no one else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, yes, I had other officers, I worked under the control of the Divisional Commander of Port Natal, I am not sure, but I think it was Brig Coetzee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Before you went to Durban, were there any weapons issued to the members of Vlakplaas who went to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, every member had his own weapon, he was responsible for his own weapon, it was a permanent issue.  In certain circumstances, with certain askaris, we take their weapons back when they return and we issue it again when they go out again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> So most of these weapons were weapons which were actually police weapons, which were in the possession of the members of Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Those were official issues, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Is it further correct that you went to Durban also to do an infiltration into the activities of the UDF?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Are you telling the hearing that you did not go to Durban to infiltrate the comrades or the UDF, you never went there to make any infiltration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, we came back to trace the terrorists.  If it seemed later that we had to infiltrate an area or organisation, or a specific group, or a specific instance, based on the information on grassroots level, we would have done that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> But when you left for Durban, your primary aim was actually to trace down the so-called terrorists who killed two police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> The purpose was to trace these people, that was not the primary purpose, it was a purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> What was the primary purpose of going to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> The objective was to trace terrorists who were responsible for killing the policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> As a result of that then your group went to Durban and you came later on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, yes, if I can remember correctly, I can be wrong, but as far as I can recollect, I arrived there the same day, but later that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And you say you were alone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> In your evidence-in-chief you said that as far as your recollection goes, Mr Nofomela was not with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> In other words you are not saying it, you are not very certain that Mr Nofomela was not with you, you are actually saying that as far as you can recollect, he was not with you, he could have been with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I am not going to dispute that, but I doubt that, I cannot recollect that whatsoever.  I could just as well have said somebody else was with me, but as far as I can remember, I was all alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And then when you arrived at Durban, you say that some of the members, some of the members had already been deployed at various places?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct, these people had already been deployed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Ramawele, Mr de Kock, did Mr Nofomela act as a driver for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes, when I was not the Commanding Officer, he acted as my driver, between 1983 and 1985, before I became Commanding Officer, he and other people were my drivers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Sorry Mr Ramawele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  You say that you agree that this AK47 weapon was actually a weapon that was lawfully obtained from Head Office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Is it true that at Vlakplaas, there were various AK47 assault rifles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> There were various types of weapons amongst others, AK47s.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You could have taken one of them to go to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> What I mean is, if you wanted to take one of them, you could have done so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> If it was a clandestine operation Mr Chairman, I could have taken weapons from Vlakplaas.  This was not a clandestine operation and we  asked for an AK47 from Headquarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Why do you say this was not a clandestine operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> This is not an operation where we drive down, shoot people and disappear as happened at various instances, I refer to Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, the handgrenades in kwaThema etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> So this was an operation where you were looking for the murderous people who had committed an offence and you were just going to trace them and arrest them and come back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Not necessarily that we would return, there could have been information to follow up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Because at that time, the Durban area, they mentioned Chesterville areas, were actually very, very flashpoints at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, those were areas where there was a struggle between the police and the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> If you say that although you were looking, you were going to trace the killers of the police officers, you could at the same time have followed some other information, that means if you got some other information, you could also further on infiltrate you know, the comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, yes, if there was such information or the Security Branch at Durban had such information, and they requested us for this information or if it was beneficial to follow up the information immediately, I think we could have done that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And as a Commander of Vlakplaas, you had to be at all times ready to undertake any operation like for instance if you follow up any information, you have to be in a position to do that, you have to be prepared to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, yes, as long as you were able to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> According to your testimony you say that the weapons that were in the possession of the members, were the police weapons, there were no illegal weapons in the possession of the members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Now, if there was, if a situation arose where you had to follow information and infiltrate, you wouldn't have been able to do so because you didn't have you know, you didn't have illegal weapons which could have convinced the comrades that you are you know, some of your members, either UDF or the ANC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> We only had the AK and the askaris themselves, based on their background and their training, they could speak the language, that was the language which was used by ANC members in camps and they knew the descriptions of the camps, they knew certain members, their families, etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> The police officers who went to Durban, did they all have their identity cards, police identity cards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Did they carry their identity cards with them in their body, in their possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> How many kombis, how many Vlakplaas kombis were used by the members to go to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, all the kombis we had there and all which were allocated to group leaders, came down to Durban, and all motor cars and other vehicles which we had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> How many kombis were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Is it not something which was quite well known among the UDF activists and the ANC activists, that the police, the Security Police are fond of using the kombis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I don't know Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> The informers never told you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, there were many more taxi's which were used as kombis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You arrived in Durban and when you arrived in Durban, the decision to go to Chesterville, you were not involved in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I can't remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> What do you remember about when you arrived in Durban, what do you remember about something that you had to do about the flashpoints and the killing of the police officers, what do you remember which you had to do, because you cannot all the time have been sleeping?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Mr Chairman, I did not sleep all the time, one has to sleep at some or other stage.    The information which we obtained came from the Security Branch, I cannot remember exactly what that was.  I cannot remember, the deployment would have been based on their demand of the Security Police, they asked Headquarters to send the whole contingent from Vlakplaas, and from there, they would take the initiative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> What I am referring to is after your arrival in Durban, already there were other members who were there, after you had arrived in Durban, now you are there, it is a flashpoint, Security Police officers have been killed, what do you remember which you had to do about this incident, what do you remember which you had to do about the killing of the police officers or the giving of instructions to any of those people, to go anywhere, what do you remember after arriving in Durban, they are there, they are deployed, what do you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> We were looking for ANC terrorists, we were busy with counter-insurgents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Did you instruct any group to go anywhere and search for the killers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I could have, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Did you instruct any group to go and infiltrate the local activists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is possible, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Does it mean that this could actually also include the Chesterville incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, probably yes, I cannot remember that however.  That request would have come from the Security Branch themselves, as they gather information and spread the information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> If you say the Security Branch, which one are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> The Security Branch at the C R Swart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You see Vermeulen say that they actually got information from the army about the flashpoints?  Does it make sense to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, no, I was listening to him and if I understood him correctly, that was after they went had gone to the police station, they got the information there, the army did not approach us at C R Swart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Which police station are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> C R Swart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You are saying that they must have spoken to the Security Police at C R Swart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, yes, those were the people who requested us and the instructions would have come from them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> But you are not able to say that as a fact, that indeed the Security Police at C R Swart told us about you know, which places are the flashpoints, you yourself, you cannot say that they said so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Mr Chairman, but they would have done that, we are not familiar with Durban and they would have had specific requests or objectives, things they wanted to achieve.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> But as the Overall Commander of the operation, is it not that very strange that you are not able to say that the Security Police at C R Swart told us that the flashpoints are at  X, Y, Z?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I said that they could have done that, I can't remember that.  I accept that they did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You also are saying that you were satisfied that in fact the Radebe's group were acting in self-defence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And after how long after the shooting did the Vlakplaas contingent go back to Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I don't know, I don't think that we went back to Pretoria immediately.  I remained there a week longer, myself and some askaris.  Some of the others, and I have already said, as far as I can remember, I can vaguely remember that we deployed to the Pongola/Piet Retief/Vryheid/Paulpietersburg, etc.   I think it was about two or three days after this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr de Kock, these askaris and the members involved in the shooting incident, what was their situation?  Were those the people who left or did they remain behind with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Mr Chairman, I have the idea that they also remained behind in Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Ramawele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.    The killers of the police officers, did you know their names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, they could have provided us with the names, I am not sure.   I cannot remember whether they gave us the names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> But Mr de Kock, the whole contingent of Vlakplaas goes to Durban to look for the killers of the police officers and you are telling this hearing that you don't remember whether you had the names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, I cannot remember back so far, it was possible that they had given us the names.  If they did not know exactly who had shot them, they could have given us the names of suspects.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Do you remember whether you had the, you know the probable place where you could find these killers, do you remember whether you had some lead where these people could be found who killed the police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Now any of the members of Vlakplaas, did - when these people were deployed, were they looking for these people who killed the police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Did they find them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Not as far as I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> After the incident where in some members, some activists were killed, at that stage the police killers were not yet found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Even after a week, the police officers were not yet found, when you left for Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> When the police officers were not found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I mean the killers of the police officers were not found when you left for Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Not as far as I know, we did not succeed in arresting the murderers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Approximately how many police officers from Vlakplaas went to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> It was our whole group, I am not sure how many we were, it could have been 40 or 50, it could have been 60.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And approximately how many left, you know the first group that went to Pretoria, to Vlakplaas, approximately how many of them left for Vlakplaas when you remained behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, as I have said some of them were re-deployed in the direction of Piet Retief, if I can remember correctly, and I think it was about 40 people.  I am speculating, it could be more or less.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You see, I get the impression that you know, immediately after the shooting of these activists, all of a sudden, an interest was lost by you Security Police officers to be in Chesterville or in Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson, it is not so.  If I can remember correctly, at that stage it was a question that after the shooting, it will be futile to attempt again to enter these areas because of the chaotic situation there, it was not governable, there would have been problems if you went there again, and it was necessary to leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Are you saying that your men were also not so trained that they could handle that kind of situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, they were trained yes, but we were a Counter-Insurgency Unit, we were not an unrest unit, we only used sharp ammunition and explosives and we were not an unrest unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You see, that is precisely the point because I am surprised why, if Chesterville was a flashpoint, etc, etc, why were the Unrest Unit not called to Chesterville to come and quell the disturbances there, why particularly Vlakplaas had to come to Chesterville, why Vlakplaas, why not the Unrest Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> We did not go to Durban to control unrest, the people who went to Chesterville did not attempt to control unrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> So the whole plus minus 50 people were just looking for the killers of two police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> As far as I know there were three policemen killed, the murderers could have been a larger group, it could have been 10, it could have been a whole cell.   The search you had to keep as broad as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Ramawele, please whose answering that cellphone, is it outside?  It is really very disturbing you know, and distractive, sorry Mr Ramawele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   You know after this shooting, this shooting incident, you know they reported to you and some members later on went back to Pretoria and you are not longer, you think the situation is no longer okay for your members to be around the area so you decided the tracing of the killers was no longer a priority at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Mr Chairman, the people who were deployed in the direction of Swaziland against the eastern border, was used to determine whether MK members were infiltrating and I kept some members with me also.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Did you visit the scene of the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> According to you, did the police also arrive at the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes, I can vaguely remember that when I arrived there, there were already people on the scene.  Policemen were on the scene and I think the area was sealed off by conscripts, if I can remember correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> How many people according to you, died in this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> As I can remember, four people were killed and three were wounded.  I have this number at the back of my head, I think that three people were wounded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And how many police officers were there, according to you were there from Vlakplaas who were also there in the shooting, how many police officers were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I think there were six or eight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> None of the six police officers were injured or killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> These police officers say that they were acting in self-defence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> This is how I understood it, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Now doesn't that leave an impression really that these police officers, they must have been ready when they got to this particular place, their guns must have been ready.  How come all of them survived, all of them are not injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman, I have to object here, my learned friend expects Mr de Kock to speculate now, it is common cause that he was not there on the scene, I do think it is an unfair question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes perhaps Mr Ramawele wants to put to Mr de Kock what would be an argument on the probabilities and perhaps wants to elicit Mr de Kock's response.  Mr de Kock, let me put it to you to make it short, the point that Mr Nofomela's legal representative is making is that it is strange or improbable that if there was an attack on the police, that six of them were not injured and many of the other people were killed and wounded.  You can comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I believe that my members knew that they were in a dangerous area, they were looking for MK members, they knew there were terrorists and they were ready.   I had personally been in fights when we were 24 and the opposition 80, we walked into the ambush and none of us were injured and eight or nine of the enemy were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Ramawele, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   You say that Willie Nortje reported to you about the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, it was he and van Dyk, I know Vermeulen was there also.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> But did van Dyk also report to you about the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Well, Willie Nortje explained to me and van Dyk was with him.  Van Dyk was not on the scene, so  he could not report back to me, but as far as I know Nortje and van Dyk approached me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Were you not with van Dyk already at the time when Nortje came to you to report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, the Officers' quarters where we were had a type of unique situation where, because you were an officer, you had to be private.  There was a shower which was used by people in two rooms, every person had his own sleeping quarters and shared a shower.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> What I want to know is, at that specific moment when Mr Nortje reported to you, were you not already with Mr van Dyk at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Van Dyk was there yes, van Dyk was not with me in my room.  They woke me up and then I saw van Dyk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Was Jeff Bosigo one of the people, he was obviously in Durban also, Jeff Bosigo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Almond Nofomela was also in Durban, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Do you know whether Nofomela and Bosigo were involved in this particular shooting or were involved, were there at the shooting or had something to do with this shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I received no such report Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> What you are saying is you are now saying that the black police officers went into Chesterville, you are satisfied that you know, they were given instructions to go there by Nortje?</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Now, is it so that the only other black police officers who were not in Chesterville, who did not go to Chesterville according to the information which is now available, was Nofomela and Bosigo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Mr Chairman, they could have been part of other groups, working in other areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Yes, I am referring to the fact that these two black police officers were not the ones who, they were not involved in this, according to the information that you now have, they were not involved in the Chesterville incident according to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> According to the information I obtained at that stage from Nortje, they were not involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Do you know what Bosigo and Nofomela were doing at the time of this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I think they were part of other groups at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You are not sure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Mr Chairman, I can't remember that exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it possible that they could have been on the scene, but not part of the infiltration group which moved into the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, then their names would have been on the list as part of this incident, and they had to make statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Even if Nofomela was only the driver of the vehicle or was on the periphery of Chesterville waiting for the people who had to do the actual job?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Nothing was covered up here, nothing was changed, no cartridges were changed, we did not know the Detectives, there was nothing to cover up here or to hide.  If Nofomela's name did not appear on the list, he was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, sorry Mr Ramawele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   Among the black police officers at Vlakplaas, who was the most senior in experience and rank at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, there was Lt Mose and Lt Lesatse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Were they also in Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And at the time of this incident, where were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> They would have been deployed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> But you are just speculating?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, I cannot remember, they definitely wouldn't have been sitting around at the police station, they would have been deployed, working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> The reason why I am asking this is because Mr Nofomela says to me that you actually told him that he shouldn't get involved in the, he shouldn't have got involved in this incident because you had another mission for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, we had no other tasks except to find these ANC members, there were no other covert tasks or clandestine tasks that we had to execute.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And you then also told him that those people were going to be shot at in Chesterville, that is what he says?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Mr de Kock, is it true that if Mr Nofomela had another task to undertake in Chesterville or Lamontville or whatever place, it would have been dangerous, it would have been foolhardy for him to get involved in another incident because he could be identified?  His cover could be blown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, I don't know, I cannot answer that.  There was no other task.  As far as I know he was not involved in this shooting, if his name does not appear on the list, then he was not there ... (no interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Which list are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> This is the list that the people's names appear that were at the shooting Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I see, you say this was not a clandestine operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Mr Chairman, it was not clandestine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> The people, I presume that you must have been worried that some people in Chesterville shot or attempted to shoot at your members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, this is the reports that had been made to me and that they then reacted, on the fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Now did, because they were acting in self-defence, did they make a statement to the police to say that they were attacked by other people so that those people should be arrested, who attacked, who wanted to attack the police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, they did make statements, naturally I cannot give evidence to this regard and I cannot remember what they said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Were the people actually arrested, the people who attempted to shoot them, some of the survivors, were they actually arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I do not know, I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> So this matter was never given, you were never serious about apprehending these people who attacked the Vlakplaas members, those who survived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, that would have depended on the Investigating Officers and what their evidence would have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> But Mr de Kock you were based in Vlakplaas, you were the Commander there and you had the power, you had the power to see to it that your members had to be protected, they had to be protected, they were doing a very good job?  Why just leave it to an Investigating Officer whom you did not even know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, counter-insurgency is a high risk job and to be shot at, was nothing strange to us.  It is very unpleasant, it is unpleasant every time, but it is nothing strange.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Do you agree that the people who, if they attempted to attack your members, they could have been linked to the UDF, ANC local activists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, possibly, the Security Branch would have investigated this part.  We were a Counter-Insurgency Unit and we would have not kept ourselves busy with the investigation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> But you came to Durban to look for, do you agree that you came to Durban to look for the, to actually do a job which could have been done by local Detectives, just to look for the killers, just to look for three killers, the local CIDs could have done that, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> The local Detective Branch did not have the capability to identify trained MK members Chairperson, Vlakplaas did have this capability.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> But Mr de Kock, if there is a lead as to the name or the whereabouts of a killer of a police officer, you don't need to be attached to Koevoet or Vlakplaas to be able to trace that person, a CID member can do that, it is just a simple investigative work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, yes, but murders of Security Policemen as far as I know, were seen as deeds of terrorists and they were investigated by the Security Branches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You see the point I am trying to make is three police officers were killed and if they were killed, what you were looking for, you were looking for those killers only, that is what you were looking for.  If you were just looking for the killers, you were not looking for people associated with the killers, you were just looking for the killers, why can't the CID just do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, terrorism was the primary function of the Security Police and the countering of terrorism and the detecting of terrorism.  The Detective Branch did not have the ability to identify a person at face value and I believe that there had been a connection between the Detective Branch and the Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I go back to my question, when you went to Durban, do you have knowledge as to the killers, what kind of information did you have about the killers of the police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, as far as I can remember, it was that it was members, it was terrorists and if I can remember correctly, it was members of MK and that these people had to be looked for.  This was given high priority.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Now did you have perhaps the address where these killers were living?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson, then the Branch would not have asked us, they would have gone to arrest the people themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> If you didn't have the name, you didn't have the address of the killers, what you had to do is you had to infiltrate the local activists and find out who killed the police officers, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> If it had been necessary or the Security Branch saw it as necessary, but on the other side, you are covering all possible transport methods like trains and taxi's to see if you can't identify the people at face value and we were quite successful with this, and by means of this, the cell or the group could be caught or broken up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Mr de Kock, I don't think you understand what I am saying, what I am saying is you went to Durban to look for the killers of two or three police officers, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You didn't have the names of the killers of the police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson, not that I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You didn't have the addresses of the killers of the police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Now, the only information that you had was that they were MK people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> But your purpose to go there was to track down and arrest the killers of these police officers, that was why you had to go to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> To search for these terrorists that had killed these Security Branch police officers, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Now obviously if you walk around the bus stops, the trains, etc, you - even if you meet an MK person, you cannot say that is the person who killed the police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson, but we would arrest him if he was a trained MK member, we would take him to C R Swart where he would be interrogated by the local C R Swart branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Did you arrest a single, do you arrest a single activist or MK member at the time when you went to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I cannot remember at that stage Chairperson, on previous occasions we had caught various MK members at Durban station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You had a lot of askaris when you came to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson, I wouldn't say we had enough, but we did have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And these are the people you say who would help in the identifying of the members of MK, etc?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> This is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> These askaris who were at Vlakplaas, did some of them have a good knowledge about Durban and the people around who were involved in local politics in Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I do not know.   I do not know how many of them had come from Durban.  Your MK members weren't necessarily area bound, you for instance did not get a Zulu from Umtata.  MK deployed their people as they thought it fit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Okay, I put it to you that when you left for Durban, your reason for going to Durban was simply to go to Durban and go to Chesterville and eliminate those activists, that is why you went to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson, not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Because according to your testimony, despite the fact that you had a large contingent of Vlakplaas members, you were very unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Sorry, could you kindly just tell me if he came to Durban to eliminate activists, do you suggest that he had the names and the identities of certain activists which he could target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> What I am putting to him is that at the shooting itself, that was a target which they had, it was a target which they had to eliminate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you mean it was an identified target at that point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the sole purpose of the operation was to eliminate them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Was to eliminate them, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That seem to have been the testimony of your client?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Yes, that is what I am saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that what you are putting to Mr de Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> That is what I am putting to him, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson, this is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And  I further put it to you that Almond Nofomela was actually involved in this operation in the sense that he drove the members up to a bridge, but did not get into Chesterville itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, this is his statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And I also put it to you that you said to him that Nofomela and Bosigo should not get involved, because you had another mission where he had to, which he had to undertake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And that the sole purpose, and that further on that you told him that the people in Chesterville were going to get shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR RAMAWELE</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Ramawele.  Mr Cornelius, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> No questions, thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR CORNELIUS</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Cornelius.  Mr Shezi, have you got any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR SHEZI:</span> Just a few Mr Chairman, thank you.   Mr de Kock, you said the whole trip to come together was not a clandestine one, in other words it was legitimate within that particular context, what do you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson, it just like all our other deployments, we were looking for terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> And that would have involved some planning as to the methods that you were going to employ in trying to locate, to identify the terrorists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, the use of askaris or the members here locally would have been at the request of the Durban Security Branch who knew how they wanted to work, where they wanted to go to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> My question is on your part, on your carrying out your mandate or in complying with the request, there would have been some planning on your part as to the method that was going to be used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson yes, we came down to Durban, we deployed, on request of the Durban Security Branch, we do what they want us to do and then you follow the information from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But beforehand you also prepared yourself for a possible infiltration and this is why Nortje had made the suggestion that an AK47 had to be gotten hold of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson, as far as I am concerned, this was good initiative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So over and above your normal modus operandi to deploy the askaris, to identify MK members and to arrest them, you also foresaw as part of the modus operandi in this case, that you would or that you had to infiltrate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, sorry Mr Shezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   You said earlier on when it was put to you by Mr Ramawele, that you had no investigative skills or anything like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, let me put it this way, it is not that one doesn't know where to look or how the one aspect would then lead into the other one, I did not investigate files, but I did not investigate cases for the court.  We were a quick reaction or deployment unit and basically a fighting unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> If you say you did not investigate for the courts, ultimately what would have become of these terrorists, just to use your phrase, had you found them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, the members that we had caught of MK or of APLA would then be handed over to the local Security Branch, they would do the questioning, they would do the identifying and they  either recruit them or they would look at court cases and if it is not maybe related to other case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> The instructions to go to Chesterville to try and infiltrate, how would that have got to Sgt Radebe for instance, the one who led the group who eventually went into the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Could you repeat that please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> All right, okay, the instructions to go to Chesterville in particular with the group what was led by Sgt Radebe, how would that have got to Sgt Radebe, who would have told him to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson I believe that it would have been at the initiative of Nortje, it could be that he received information from the Branch or that information had been spread to him by another means.  But here it is testing and searching that is involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Nortje would have done this out of his own, on his own initiative, without consultation with you, without you giving an authorisation for him to do that as the Commander of the whole Vlakplaas, C10 Unit which had come for this purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson yes, he can use his own initiative.  He could already quite possibly have been already with the station, he could have covered that with the last trains, he could have possibly already have checked the last taxi stands and then decided let's go and look at another place.  But this all speculation, this is left over to the member's initiative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> As a matter of protocol, as a person who was a Commander, I am sorry who was the Commander, what would have been the procedure, wouldn't you have been told about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, the mandate is to look for terrorists.  I would not limit the members about where they could search for terrorists, they know where to find me, I am at a central point, we have five or six groups operating and I was at a central position, where I found myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> No, my question is, shouldn't you sanction any operation of any particular sort?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, if he was in Umlazi first and then decided to go to Chesterville, that is his initiative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Are you suggesting that the members that you came down with here in Durban, it was just free for all, they could go wherever they wanted to go, employ whatever methods they wanted to employ, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson, this is not a question that there had been no control, they would go or they would act on information or suggestions from the Security Branch and over and above the fact that we report and investigate information, that the Security Branch listen to telephone calls, they have their own informers and they have their own sources and then they could possibly channel these people in a certain direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> The Chesterville incident for instance, at some stage it used, what was involved was the use of an AK47 which had been properly obtained, where permission was sought, application was made, it was fetched within a particular context properly, are you saying the use of an AK in that operation could have been done by Willie Nortje on his own initiative, with his own discretion, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, let me put it to you broadly, as the rest of the people deploy in the country, if we employed in a week and it is for a period of a month, then I possibly spent another week in Pretoria, the other people would possibly be one group n Cape Town, one group in Natal and the other group in Piet Retief, and the Division Leader would then go to the Security Branch and they would work under the command of the Security Branch and then they would gather information and from there onwards they would use their own initiative to try to capture these terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Sorry, can we just focus on the Chesterville incident, you said this was not a clandestine operation, as a result the obtaining of an AK was done in terms of a certain particular procedure which Vlakplaas operated, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, this was not a clandestine operation, then we could have just shot the people and disappeared, this is clandestine.   The way in which they had used the AK is a question of going in in a covered way, the people took responsibility for the shooting, they did not run away from this, it was not a clandestine operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> What I am talking about was that the AK that was eventually used to convince those people in Chesterville - sorry can I finish - had initially been obtained by yourself and Nortje from Schoon in Vlakplaas in a certain, particular, proper way, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, if a situation had developed where it would have been necessary for these people to confirm their bona fides and they could have used the AK for this purpose, not specifically just Nortje, if another group had information and they felt that they could possibly infiltrate a cell or they could gain someone's confidence by showing an AK, then the same AK would have been given to another group to treat it in this way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> If I may ask you, how did the Nortje group obtain that AK in order to take it with them and eventually ending up in Chesterville with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, the AK was drawn from Security Headquarters and Nortje handled the weapon from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> So are you saying the use and control of this AK47 was solely within the discretion and exclusive use of Nortje, you knew nothing about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No, this is not what I said Chairperson.  I said that I had gone along with Nortje to Brig Schoon who had written this thing out, we went down to Capt Drury and we went to draw the weapon there and Nortje handled the weapon from there, only later on that day, I went.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> What I am trying to find out is, the use and control of that AK, was it under your supervision as a Unit Commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes, I would overall be in command of that weapon Chairperson, it is not a question that I disassociate myself with the weapon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> And that weapon was taken and eventually used in Chesterville, are you saying at that stage and with regard to that particular incident, you knew nothing about it, Nortje just used his own initiative and discretion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, it is not that Nortje was acting recklessly, they acted in the face of information that they had gained at Joint Management System that had existed, they went to go and test this information and to go and do a search operation, and this at the end of the day, was the result of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> I am not talking about the culpability of Nortje, let's talk about the Management System that was in place at that time, that includes you as the Unit Commander, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson - sorry, could you please repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> All right, let's talk about the Management System that you say was there and within which ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Please start again, I am sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Let's go back and talk about the Management System which was in place at the time and within which Nortje operated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> That Management System consisted of you as a Unit Commander, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> And there is an AK involved of which you had overseen its use and control, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> That is not being used recklessly, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> So if Nortje was to take that AK to go wherever that he was going to, he should have got your permission or you should have known about it at least?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson, not necessarily.  He uses his initiative as a Commander on the ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Now I am confused, I am talking about the AK which you have admitted that you were in control of, that you had to give, I am asking did you have to give sanction - you were in control as to the use and control of that weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> My question is if that weapon was going to be taken and be used elsewhere be it Chesterville or kwaMashu, you had to give sanction to it, because you had control?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson, it is already in possession of a person who quite probably if the necessity had developed or the possible use of that had developed, then he could have used this weapon for this and this is why the weapon was drawn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> So when it comes to Nortje's taking of this weapon to Chesterville, you are no longer in control of it, you are not in charge, you are not part of the Management System at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson, it is a question of delegation.  It is not that the weapon had been given to someone who may not have been in possession of this weapon, it was delegated authorisation and if he believed that he could achieve success by gaining information or at least gaining someone's confidence, that he could have used this weapon for this purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr de Kock, this weapon was gotten with the aim of convincing people or at least mislead people that the person showing the weapon to them, had also been part of the liberation movements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> This is true Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You would have, if you had this weapon in your possession, you had to go and show this weapon to these people, would this have shown any purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Not myself as a white person Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So you gave this weapon with the aim of it being used by people who could convince these people that they were fellow members of the same movement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> This is true Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then just to follow the line right through, if we accept that the weapon had been in Chesterville on this specific incident, then the indications are very strong that an attempted infiltration must have been made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson.   I was not at the scene, but I will speculate now if it had been done on request of Radebe and if he lodged this request to Nortje, then he must have believed that they would attempt to infiltrate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Shezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.   The killing of this three Security Policemen, do you know as to how was it concluded that those who might have killed them, were comrades or ANC activists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I think that naturally the weapons that had been used, this would have led to the belief that they were MK members.  We would not have come to look for comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> But did you double check that, whether the weapons which  were used, were suggestive of that which is ANC activists might have killed those Security Policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I believe at that stage when we came here, that information had been given to us.   The Head of Security Branch at that stage, or the Division Head, was experienced Security Police officers, Col Taylor was seen as an expert in his area, they wouldn't have misled us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> You said after you had received the report about that there was a shooting in Chesterville, you got up and dressed and then you went to the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I wouldn't say that I went to the scene, I think we first went to the police station, I am not sure which one this was, and I think, I think I met Col Taylor there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Who went with you to the police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I know about Nortje, I cannot recall van Dyk to my memory, but I know that myself and Nortje went to the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> This AK, do you know if it was used during the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I heard this later on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> What did you hear later on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I cannot give evidence to this effect, but I think Magage told me that when the shooting took place, he used the AK to defend himself.  It was something in this line, I cannot testify on his behalf.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> The attack on the police officers, in other words, Radebe's group and the askaris, the incident in question, wouldn't this have been more of an incentive or rather an encouragement for your group to stick around in Durban to further seek to infiltrate ANC activists, because clearly this should have established a trend that there is really the killing of policemen around here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, as I said if I can remember correctly, I stayed here for a while and I held eight or nine of the askaris with me.   We also received orders then.  If Durban felt that for some or other reason it would have been better for us to go and work on the border to prevent exfiltration, then I would have gone to do this work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> But wouldn't you say the Chesterville incident established that there is really a trend of killing police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I cannot say that Chairperson.  In any case broadly speaking on a national basis, it had been practice that police officers, especially black police officers had been murdered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Do you have any idea as to why after the shooting, your members just left the scene without calling for reinforcements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, that area as it was also mentioned back then, was a liberated area.  The comrades were in full control of this area.   The people could possibly have stayed there and if 400 or 500 of a crowd had come down on them, and they shot another 100 people, then the next question would have been don't we have to withdraw now.  For this reason, when I went to the police station that morning, we waited there for reinforcements, we went in a group, we did not go there as individuals to the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr de Kock, this is precisely one of the questions here, evidence before us is that they had withdrawn in a hurry, immediately if I remember correctly, they had withdrawn immediately from the scene.  Reference had been made to Nortje's statement that says that he went to Chesterville, but the effect of all these actions were that they had gone from Chesterville to C R Swart, they don't know the distance, we will hear the distance later on, that they had withdrawn.  Based on all indications before us, there were no immediate steps done to go and look for these attackers,  it could possibly have been the people that your members were looking for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I will not be able to answer on behalf of the members that had been on the scene, I am just trying to help us to sort this out, and this is why I am telling you that it could be that askaris had attacked the people, maybe there weren't enough of them.  Maybe we will have to ask the members who were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I do realise this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> What made them decide to get away, what made Nortje decide to say let's first go back, there has to be reasons for this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you see there is also a suggestion and it is possibly taken further, I am not sure,  that one of the police officers had lost his head and then he started shooting with his uzi and then a shooting started?  You know, this is a whole other tint on this incident itself, but you naturally cannot comment on this.  But let's suppose this is what had happened, let's suppose that someone had lost his head and started shooting and then the shooting broke out and that this is how the whole thing took place, now we get the situation where the whole group withdraws immediately from the scene, there is no immediate attempt made to arrest the attackers, and this is the type of questions that do arise.  You say that you naturally cannot give comment on the immediate situation at the scene, we understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson, the Commander at the scene would do this according to his circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This is the point that is made here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I've got no problem with this Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Shezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   By that time you had known Nofomela for quite some time, or let's say you have known him very well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> At that time, is he a person you knew him to be okay upstairs, was he mentally sound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> He is not somebody who would see things that other people don't see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson, not that I know of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Why would he say you were around in the local vicinity at that time and he saw you there and then you are saying you were not there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, I would probably have said the same if I had waited like him and if I tried to get a stay of execution.  I could believe that this possibly could be the reason for this and I don't blame him for this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, that will be all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SHEZI</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Shezi.  Ms Patel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS PATEL:</span> Thank you Honourable Chairperson.  Mr de Kock, can you just tell us the askaris who came to Durban, what type of weapons would they have been issued with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, they would have had their service pistols, 9mm pistols and in the case of the ladies, .32 pistols and then some of them had Uzi's or HMKs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Uzi's and what else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> It HMK, that is the Walter hand-machine gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Can you give me an indication if I were to shoot with a 9mm pistol, how far away from the point where I shot, would the cartridge fall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, this would depend from weapon to weapon, I cannot give you the distances now, but it would have to be close to the shooter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This is regarding a Baretta and the P38, I think that is one of the others that you mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson, some of the weapons throw it out to the left or to the right and other slightly to the back, it depends from fabrication to fabrication.  I am not an expert.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you say that you would not expect that if one of those weapons had to be fired, that the cartridge would end up very far away from the point where the shot had been fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson, it would be in the vicinity of the person doing the shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Would you say within a radius of two steps, three steps or five steps from the person doing the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I would say to be safe between one step and four steps, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, and sorry, a .76 cartridge, 7.65 cartridge, sorry, from what kind of firearm would that cartridge come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> It comes from a .32 calibre Chairperson, there are hundreds of makes of .32 calibre, but the police use the Walter PPK and this was issued to female members and this was a .32 calibre, this is 7.65 mm's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> All right, and 6.35 cartridge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> 6.?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Sorry, 6.35 cartridge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is a .25 pistol Chairperson.  This would be the ones that women normally carry around in their purses, it is very small, actually it is useless although it could be deadly at times, but it was not issues to the police and it was not a standard issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is this a little bit more effective than the self-defence spray?</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I would rather use the self-defence spray Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Ms Patel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> All right, thank you.   Tell me, a 9mm bullet shell that is copper, how does that differ, would that come from a different type of firearm as opposed to the Baretta, the standard Baretta issue or not, does that make a difference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, you get certain different types of cartridges, but the type issues to the SAP and the Army was bronze, not necessarily bronze, but let's say copper, a copper shell.  Your calibre is 9mm parabellum, this would be 9 x 19mm's, both the P38 and also the Baretta uses the same cartridge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> All right, and a 9mm lead bullet head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, not used by the police and also not issues Chairperson, not in your machine pistol like the Uzi or the HMK and also not in the pistol, because this could lead to jamming, to a weapon jamming or not feeding properly, and the point is soft.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> All right, thank you for that.  Can I just move on to a different point.  When you arrived in Durban, your function to a large extent would have been that of a co-ordinator of the various groups, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Who would you have liaised with the Durban Security Branch, who would your contact person have been in order to manage this co-ordination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> We worked under command and this would have been Col Taylor and then the Commander of the Durban Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, so your contact person would have been Col Taylor, would Lt Hunter have fallen under the command of Col Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> No, he wouldn't?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.  And then as part of your explanation that this operation wasn't clandestine or couldn't have been clandestine, it is because there wasn't just a shooting and people disappeared, that is correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> But we have heard evidence in other cases where operations were clandestine or where things had gone wrong, where subsequent to that, in a sense the sweeper would be called in who would do various things, amongst others, would co-ordinate the giving of statements, would co-ordinate the version that is then given at the trial or the inquest, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Thank you Honourable Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS PATEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Ms Patel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Mr de Kock, maybe an immediate follow up on that, assuming that this was supposed to have been a clandestine operation and unfortunately some of the people who were attacked, survived and would possibly give evidence, was it not normal that a sweeper would come in and prepare the statements for an inquest and everything in that fashion, is such a situation not what usually used to happen in the past?</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> If it had been a clandestine operation, yes Chairperson, then something like this could happen, but this was not a clandestine operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> If one looks at Exhibit D which is hand-written and under normal circumstances if it was a request like we had a request or an Intelligence note which was done before an operation, we saw an Intelligence note in the Nelspruit incident, that was thoroughly prepared, it was typed, if one looks at this one, would it not fit to a sort of cover-up, "dekstorie", which was done after the incident, the letter being hand-written, maybe backdated to the 6th of June and written in hand instead of being typed properly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson, this was definitely not one of those cases, and I want to give you the assurance that nothing that one is proud of, but if this was a clandestine operation, then there would have been no survivors, not at all.  I can give you that assurance.  As we had gone in Swaziland and all the other cases, Ms Patel had led evidence there too, if we had gone there, we kill everyone, you make sure that everyone is dead, this was not a clandestine operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> We have seen Mr Nofomela being adamant, insisting that you were there and you deny that you were not at the bridge and in other words you didn't practically participate in the operation, is it not perhaps so that when Nofomela started talking about these things, even when he appeared before the Harms Commission, he didn't talk about Chesterville, maybe as a result of that, you didn't apply for amnesty for the Chesterville event and as a result, you don't want to put yourself into the picture?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson, no.   If there was something wrong here, I would have applied for amnesty in this case.  I was not at the bridge, I give you that assurance.  I have not once hesitated to take responsibility for myself or on behalf of my people for any shooting incident, and I would not have done it in this case either.   I can give you that assurance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> During the Nelspruit 4 incident, we heard that there was the death of a white woman in Witbank who died in a robbery and that 15 askaris were sent there, was Simon Radebe and Nofomela one of the people who accompanied the askaris to Witbank, can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I have no memory about who went, some of the askaris did go and I also said that I had sent some of the Koevoet members in case a tracking had to be done.   It was on request of I think Gen Engelbrecht had asked us and it was on request of that Murder and Robbery Unit and that Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> During the inspection in loco which we attended at Vlakplaas, you gave us the impression that you were sort of a person who always fought for a transformation, I remember a specific incident that you changed the situation how the black members were treated in Vlakplaas in the sense that at the end, you were treated equally, everybody was treated equally, but we have just heard from Nofomela that the way you operated, there was a difference between how white people were treated from how black people were treated, more specifically that they as the black members were never in other words, there were no operation where a white person was killed?  What is your comment about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Chairperson, no, there is more than one answer, or there is more than one question in the first place.  I could make changes in Vlakplaas, because I was the Commanding Officer, I could not do this beforehand.  I did make these changes and black members could start driving the same vehicles as the white members, the canteen had been opened up and various changes had been made.   I started the first black Parachute Unit, I did this because I felt that we needed a black Parachute Unit and where it was in my ability, I brought these black people, black members on an equal footing, I knew that the black members could not get housing and they could not get housing subsidies.  I here refer to unmarried people and in this regard, I did what I could.  Unfortunately I could not usurp the government and bring them in, but where it was in my ability, I did what I could possibly do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Finally ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> There was also another part, it was two questions, regarding white people being killed Chairperson.  There are now millions of white people saying that they had fought for the ANC and that they had supported the ANC, this is not the case.  Where myself and my people fought, we found black MKs and black people, but in 1985 in December, a white woman had died in Lesotho in a skirmish, where she died in cross-fire, she was the wife of the senior MK member in Lesotho, the Commander of MK in Lesotho.  I know that we were looking for Damian de Lange who was an MK member in Swaziland, on occasion we just missed him, we were drunk that evening, we just missed him, we would have shot him if we had found him and we also looked for Mr Kasrils on occasion where we received information that he was there.  I smuggled some of the askaris through to Swaziland and we went to go and look for him, so the white people that we could reach, who were MK members, we did try and get to them.  There weren't really white people who were fighting for MK Chairperson, although as I say now all of a sudden there are two million white people who fought for MK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Finally, the impression I got after listening to Nofomela is that when he was in trouble after he had killed a white person at Britz, he expected either you or people from Vlakplaas to come to his assistance, but the message you sent to him was sort of a racial tone to say because he has killed a white person, he would have to carry the pain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson, this is not true.   Of the Vlakplaas members, black and white, visited him on a regular basis.  The person who told him that he would just have to take the pain, was not me, it was a Captain or a Lieutenant Snyders at that time.  The warder who was there at Correctional Services where Snyders told this to Nofomela that he, Snyders, was saying this, this warder is available, I will get his name for you just now.  He was then a Warrant Officer when Capt Freddie Khoza and Lt Snyders came to visit there, it is a person, Warrant Officer Steynberg, he was present when Snyders told him that.  This was not a message from me, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Maybe the real final question will be, if Nofomela didn't participate in the Chesterville incident, have driven the people to the bridge there, why do you think is he applying for amnesty for this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I do not know Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In other words why does he put himself on the scene, this is the question that my colleague is asking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> I understand Chairperson, and I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will take the lunch adjournment and reconvene at two o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Honourable Chairperson, sorry, just  one minute before ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can do it when we come back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">EUGENE ALEXANDER DE KOCK:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please be seated.  Are there any other questions from the panel?  Oh yes, you wanted to say something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Yes, thank you Honourable Chairperson, just for the record, Mr de Kock, following on the questions by the Honourable Mr Sibanyoni, referred to a clandestine operation which if an operation of that nature was carried out, it would be, they would make sure that everybody was killed and he referred to the Swaziland incident in which I was the Leader of Evidence, I just want to place on record that that was in fact the Nyanda McFadden matter in which there was in fact a survivor.  That is all, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Mr de Kock ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was the survivor not an informer who was arranged beforehand that he could get away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> No, Honourable Chairperson, in fact that was the one bone of contention in that matter, in that the name of the informer, nobody would give to us.  There was no indication that the person who survived, was in fact the informer.  In fact, if one looked at the testimony of Cronje regarding that specific person, I do recall saying that it wasn't Vlakplaas' modus operandi to kill women and that is in fact why she was left behind, not that there was any allegation of her being the informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I am referring to the person who escaped and who was wounded in the foot, not the other one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Mr de Kock, maybe finally on my side, Simon Radebe was part and parcel of the operation, yet he didn't apply for amnesty, do you know the reason why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Hugo, have you got any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR HUGO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   Mr de Kock, one of the main State witnesses in your criminal trail, was Willie Nortje?</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And Mr Willie Nortje was a confidante of yours once upon a time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And at a certain stage he was turned, he walked over and he provided information to the Goldstone Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Would you agree with me to say that Mr Willie Nortje's evidence against you, figuratively broke your back in the criminal trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And that there is no love lost between you and Mr Willie Nortje?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And in all his affidavits he made very detrimental remarks against you as a person and he went out of his way to incriminate or do injustice to you and during the criminal trial we also found out that Mr Nortje was stationed in Denmark before he testified in your trial, for days on end he made statements against you in the presence of the Attorney General?</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And you have no doubt that if there is one person who wants to incriminate you in all possible things, that is Mr Willie Nortje?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And then we find that Mr Willie Nortje in his statement said you were not on the scene and you had nothing to do with this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And then regarding Mr Steve Bosch, he also testified against you in the criminal trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> He also gave evidence which hurt you in the sense that you were convicted on the strength of his evidence in the Bheki Mhlangeni matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> He also said that you were not on that scene, you had nothing to do with that operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And then one other aspect, it was suggested to you that in Pretoria already you had decided to go to Chesterville and to kill that group of people, have you ever been to Chesterville before this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Did you for example know whether there was an army camp in Chesterville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No, I did not know it then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Have you ever before heard of a person called Hunter, who was stationed in this army camp in Chesterville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Mr Hunter says amongst others, he says that the members of Vlakplaas arrived there and amongst others they enquired about the existence of a certain Charles Ngcobo, have you ever heard of such a person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No, never, only during the trial in the Regional Court, that was a name that was mentioned after the shooting incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> The names of the deceased, have you ever heard before of these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Then it was also mentioned that the people who were involved in the operation, disappeared as quickly as possible from the scene.  Is there any way according your knowledge, and according to the experience you had, why - how the people could have remained on the scene of the shooting after the incident and how they had to see that the people could be arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Mr Chairman, they could have done that, but to the detriment of their own lives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> The only people who had authority to arrest somebody, was Mr Radebe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, there were two or three other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And if they had remained on the scene and arrested people, let me put it to you in this way, would it not have led that the identity of the askaris would have been made known?</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And they would have endangered their lives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Mr de Kock it was also stated to you that Vlakplaas by implication was involved in killing the black members of the population and they avoided killing white members or society and especially black members of Vlakplaas would not be used in operations where white people had to be killed, can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That was what was said Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Can you remember the incident of Dirk Coetzee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> You have applied for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And shortly the planning was that Mr Dirk Coetzee had to be killed in a gruesome way, on an explosive device which had to be sent to him in Lusaka where he was busy providing information to the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And that caused a problem with you and many of the people at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And also with the black members at Vlakplaas, you had a problem with this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Mr Radebe who is going to testify in a while, is an applicant in this matter, in the sense that he was involved in taking this parcel-bomb to the post office and this had the objective in mind to take Mr Coetzee's life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> I have no further questions, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR HUGO</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Hugo.   Mr de Kock, thank you very much, you are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KOCK:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Hugo, do you oppose Mr Nofomela's application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> No Mr Chairman, we don't oppose Mr Nofomela's application.  The only reason why we are here is that Mr Nofomela's version that Mr de Kock gave him instructions and that Mr de Kock was the important point around which that whole operation centred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But any finding that we make, whether Mr de Kock was there or not, would not be a problem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And we don't make findings whether an implicated person is guilty or not, because our finding is not going to help in any case, so I just want to see that we limit it as far as possible to the relevant facts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> I agree with you Mr Chairman.  While we are talking about this, you will remember that I said in chambers, Mr Radebe is available for the matter which is being discussed down here and the planning was not that he would be a witness in this matter, but I have told you that it is our approach that if we can assist to clear up things which are not clear in this whole probe process, we will assist you as far as possible.  Mr Radebe is here, if you want to listen to his evidence, we will help as far as possible on one condition that Mr Radebe will start testifying in his own application tomorrow morning and if he is not in a position to continue with his application tomorrow morning, this will mean that that hearing will have to be postponed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we take note of that.  Mr Ramawele, what is your client's position in regard to Mr Radebe?  Has he got any particular view on whether Mr Radebe's evidence is relevant or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Mr Chairman, the position of my client is that Mr Radebe went into Chesterville on foot with the other members and that he was at the bridge, and therefore his position is that Mr Nofomela was at the bridge with Bosigo and other members and therefore he will still continue to maintain that Radebe went in there on foot and whilst he was waiting at the bridge with other members, including Mr de Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the submission, is the submission that Mr Radebe's evidence would be relevant to the application or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I think from the evidence that has been adduced at this point in time, it appears to me that it is relevant because he was there and, he was there and he probably knows who are the members who were at the bridge and I think it is relevant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Mr Cornelius, have you got any submissions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> I've got no submissions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Shezi, is the evidence of Mr Radebe relevant for your purposes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> That is so Mr Chairperson, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Patel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> My submission is that I think to come to a clear understanding of exactly what took place there,  Mr Radebe's testimony would in fact be relevant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Hugo, won't you please call Mr Radebe?  Mr Radebe, please switch on the microphone in front of you and please will you stand, I want to administer the oath to you.  Can you give your full names for the record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Magopa Simon Radebe.</p>

<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, you may be seated.  Mr Hugo, would you please present his evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR HUGO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Mr Radebe, you have already been told that you are an implicated party in this amnesty application, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Mr Radebe, regarding your own application, you did not apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And you have consulted with your legal representative regarding your amnesty application and on your insistence and as well as obtaining legal advice, it was decided that you did not commit an offence and did not need to apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> But you have applied for amnesty regarding many more incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Mr Radebe, do you want to look at the documents placed in front of you, that is Bundle 2, from page 19 up to page 21, do you have it in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct, I have it with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> In the affidavit and this has been handed in, during the inquest which was held after this incident, which became known as the Chesterville incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> You went through this with your legal representative, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> One other aspect that you did not address is when this incident happened and you went back to the C R Swart building, did you report back to anybody else or did you go back to the sleeping quarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I went to report to someone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, that is the evidence.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, it is in the Supplementary Bundle, haven't you got that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you got one now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Yes, I've got, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Mr Radebe, you were also part of the group that came to Durban, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> With whom did you come to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> The whole of Vlakplaas came down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Upon your arrival here in Durban, what was the first thing that you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We went to drop our goods at the base where we would be accommodated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> So from Vlakplaas you went directly to the army base?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No, I said at the C R Swart base where we were accommodated.   You asked me the first thing I did when I arrived in Durban, I am telling you exactly what happened when I arrived here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Okay.   And did you bring along the vehicle that you normally used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Was that a kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> In respect of this particular incident, were you in charge of any people at any stage in respect of this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Who gave you the instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> It was Sgt Willie Nortje, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> What precisely, what instruction did he give you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Which instructions are you talking about sir, about the people who were supposed to be in the kombi or the trip to Chesterville, what are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I am referring to the going to Chesterville.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, he gave me instructions.  He said I should go with Sgt Monyoa, Sgt Mogadi, myself Sgt M.S. Radebe, Cons M.A. Seleka, Cons Chris Magopa who was an askari, Thabo Magagi who was also an askari and a female Cons Shosha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> So you, all these people were they travelling in the kombi in which you were the driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> When you left for Chesterville, were you the only people from Vlakplaas who went to Chesterville in that kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, in the kombi, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> There were no other members from Vlakplaas following you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> There were white members who were following us, Warrant Officer Vermeulen, Warrant Officer Frank McCarter, Sgt Nortje, Sgt Steve Bosch, if I still remember quite well.  If there was another car, I did not see it, I only remember the ones that I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> At the time when Sgt Nortje gave you the instruction to get into Chesterville, where was Mr de Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Mr de Kock was not with us, he was at the barracks at C R Swart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And then what precisely, what was the instruction about precisely, what were you supposed to do in Chesterville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We were supposed to infiltrate the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> After infiltrating them, what were your further instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> There was a certain guy, I have just forgotten his name, he was wanted for a murder, it was alleged that he belonged to a group that killed the municipal policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Now, the members who were with you, were they all armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> They were armed with police pistols, police firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Did they have police identity cards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I had mine, I do not know whether the others had their cards, but we supposed at all times, to have those cards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And, but at the same time you were going to infiltrate, the instruction was that you should go and infiltrate those people in Chesterville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> How long have you been, how long at that time had you been a Security Police officer, at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Since 1977, it was 10 years, ten or nine years, just around there, but that was from 1977.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> The operation that you were involved in was a very dangerous operation in the sense that when you are going to infiltrate, anything can happen?  You know, it can go wrong, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And obviously when you go to infiltrate, and persuade and convince people that you are part of them, it is also possible that they could want to assure themselves that you are indeed so, it could even involve people searching you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I do not recall any operation where we were searched, I do not foresee a situation where we would be searched.  We tried by all means not to carry anything that would link us to be policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> If in your experience, if you are, if you meet ANC operatives and you pretend to be, or the UDF and you pretend to be them and they discover you are a Security Police officer, what would have happened to you, in your experience?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> They would kill us or there would be a fight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> So that is something that you knew even before you went to Durban, that it is always a possibility that you could be killed if you are discovered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Can you repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Before you went to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Aren't you talking about Chesterville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Just answer my question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I am asking, I am responding to your question, you are telling me that would it not be possible for them to search us at Chesterville, then you are now talking of Durban, I have to get your question clear, so that I respond properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Radebe, the question is even before you departed from Vlakplaas for Durban, you were aware of this possibility that if people that you are trying to infiltrate, find out that you are actually a member of the Security Police, you could be killed, you can get involved in a fight, that is the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Ramawele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  And yet, and yet all the police officers carried firearms which identified them with the police and they are going to infiltrate an opponent, is that possible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Chairperson, if I understood you well, you did not ask me which guns did we carry when we got into, had you put your question that way, I would have responded to it properly Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Let's go back to the question, the members that were with you, had firearms with them, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, we had guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And these arms, these firearms were firearms which were South African firearms, they were firearms which could, they were the standard South African Police Service firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, they had something like a, let me call it a stamp, it was something printed on the gun, you would not wipe it off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> So the members of the police went to infiltrate whilst carrying firearms which clearly identified them with the police, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is not what I am saying to you, what I am telling you is that they had their guns, but when they were infiltrating, they left the guns in the kombi with me.  They went inside with nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I see, so all the members had no firearms when they entered into that particular premises?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct, three of them got in without guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Was that to try to protect themselves so that they shouldn't be identified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I want to go back to your other question, what if they were searched and identification cards or SAP guns were found, we were supposed to have guns on our way, but to get into, the guns were supposed to be left behind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> In short you are saying that they left the guns in the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> They left the guns with me in the kombi, that is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Did you go with them or did you stay behind in the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Myself, Sgt Monyoa, Chris Magopa and Magadi, we were left behind in the kombi.  Cons Seleka, Cons Magagi and Female Cons Shosha went inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Where was the kombi parked in relation to, or let me put it this way, the members who went to infiltrate, did they go into a house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Where was the kombi parked in relation to the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Between 20 to 25 metres from the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> So the people from the house, they knew that there was a kombi and there were also other people in the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> So even if a person wanted to go into the kombi to search the kombi to see that these are truly comrades, you would have done so, because the kombi was just not far from the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, that is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Did you see the shooting itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> What were you doing when you saw the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Can I first explain to you what happened before the shooting started, because there is something that you left out.  Is it not important for you to know why they went inside without guns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I am just asking, somebody else might ask you, I am just asking you what were you doing when you saw the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I shot as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And you also saw the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> It was dark, I just shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> How did the shooting start?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I took out an order, I said let us arrest them and a bullet came from the house and we returned fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Was it the very first, was it at the very first occasion when you went into that house that the shooting started, you never went to the house twice or thrice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> So you went to Chesterville, some members got into the house and later on there was a shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is not correct, you did not ask me these questions before.  That is not how you put it sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> All I want to know is at the time when the shooting occurred, was it on the only occasion that you visited that particular house, that is what I want to know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Okay, now can you explain to us how the shooting started again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We were outside the house, I spoke in Zulu, I said "let us arrest them", let me put it in Sotho, I actually put it in Zulu so that everyone could understand what I was saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Can I just put it this way, can you just explain to the hearing from the moment when you arrived until the shooting started, can you just explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> He is asking you to tell us the first, when you first came at that house, from that moment,, what happened, until the shooting started?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> When we arrived, Norma Shosha spoke to one comrade, they said they wanted to see our proof.  We said our AK47s are hidden in the cemetery, Norma Shosha and an unknown man went into the house, we went to Willie, we said these people want a proof, Willie gave us an AK47, we went back.   Norma Shosha then said is somewhere in Chesterville, it was at the hill, only to find that it was a wrong house.  After 15 or 20 minutes, if I remember well, I sent Brown and Chris Magopa to go and look for them, because it had been a long time since they left.  On their way, they met them and they told them that it was a wrong house, now they went back to the same house and we began to suspect that these people were not telling the truth, they were trying to protect Charles because we did not know his face.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Can you just stop there, because I am getting confused.  You know, on the first occasion you went into a house and people, some members went into the house and the inmates were not satisfied about the bona fides of those people, then you went back to fetch an AK47, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Then you came back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Did you then go to the very same house where the inmates were not satisfied about your bona fides?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We did not get into the house, we just parked.  I think they heard when the kombi approached to bring them an AK47.  They went into the house with the AK47, without bullets, without a magazine.   Later on I gave Norma Shosha and Magagi, I told them to be very careful not to put the magazine inside the AK47, because they can request to see whether the gun was functioning and anything could happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> So you are in the kombi, you are outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Myself, Chris Magopa, Brown, Solomon Monyoa and Aubrey Mogadi, we were inside the kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Ramawele, it is yourself, Chris Magopa and who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Solomon Monyoa, he is now late.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just a minute, Solomon who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Monyoa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Aubrey Mogadi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> The others were inside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you were in the kombi outside, parked outside in the street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were four, were you four in the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is this now when you came back with the AK47?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All right, now just step back a little bit, when you went to fetch the AK47, which of your people were in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> M.A. Seleka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just go slow.  M.A. Seleka, who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Thabo Magagi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> And female Const Shosha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Female Const Shosha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you left the three of them inside the house when you went to fetch the AK47 rifle, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, now then you go back to the same house, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You parked your kombi in the street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How far from this house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Between 20 and 25 metres, if I recall well Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, all right, now you parked again, you've got the AK47, the four of you are in the kombi.  Tell us now what happened from there onwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Norma Shosha came with the first person, unknown to me.  I gave them an empty AK47, they then said they were leaving for the uphill houses to check for another comrade.  Norma Shosha then ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, did you give them the AK47 without a magazine and without ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who did you give it to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I gave it to Female Const Shosha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All right, it is Female Const Shosha and this unknown person and they tell you now they are going uphill to look for another comrade, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No, they first go back to the house to show the others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So they take this AK47 and they go back inside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All right, now you are still sitting in the kombi, now what happens then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> They came back to tell us that they were going up the hill and I gave, in fact Norma Shosha asked me whether I was not going to give them a magazine.  She said maybe they will request from us to see the magazine and the bullets, I gave it to her and I said "please don't put this in the magazine.  What you can do Norma Shosha, you can give it to Thabo", because Thabo was heavily built.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All right, now you say that they came, who are they that came out of the house now with Cons Shosha as you ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> It was Norma Shosha and Seleka, I remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> The two of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The two of them came out of the house, the two of them came out of the house and they came to the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, they came to the kombi to tell us that they were going, Magagi and the rest were in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And Shosha spoke to you about the magazines and you gave it to her and then, what did they do, Seleka and ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> They went back to the house, they were actually going to tell us that they were leaving the house so that we don't get surprised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But they went back inside the house, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, I think they were telling them that they were ready to leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, no, no, it is all right, don't tell us things that you don't know, don't speculate, it makes the story even more complicated.   They went back into the house, Shosha and Seleka, then you are still sitting in the kombi the four of you, what happens then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> They left Chairperson, for quite a while.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see them coming out of the house again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who did you see coming out of the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I saw people getting out of the house, I could not see who each one of them was because it was dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see any of them, did you identify any of them, of these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you don't know who was it that came out of the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what happened to these people that came out of the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> They were away for 20 to 25 minutes if I recall well because Solomon Monyoa and Chris Magoba went out and I was left behind with Mogadi.  On the way they met and they told us that, they told the two that the house that they had been to was a wrong house, then they all came back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just a minute Mr Radebe, did you hear all this?  Did you hear what was said here, that you are telling us now about, were you not sitting in the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I was in the kombi, I sent people to go and look for them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but did you hear what those people that you sent, said to these other people?  Were you not sitting in the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I think me and Mogadi went to fetch them with the kombi, if I recall well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We only want to hear about things that you actually heard  with your own ears or you saw with your own eyes.   Do you follow that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I follow that Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You must just tell us that, don't tell us anything else.  You sent two people out to go and look for these other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes.  The whole group came back, I do not remember, but I heard with my ears because they said this was a lie, the house that we had been to was a wrong house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you now hear that it was a lie and they had gone to a wrong house, what happens then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We went to the first house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Chairperson, please bear with me, this incident happened a while ago, if I recall well, they did not drive with us in the kombi, because there was a shortcut between the two houses to go to the first house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.   All right, Mr Ramawele, I was hoping that I could get to the shooting bit, perhaps you can do a bit better.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I see, Mr Chairman, thank you Mr Chairman.   The, when you say they reported that they went to the wrong house, what does that mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> They met on the way, Solomon Monyoa and Magoba met with Norma Shosha on their way back and they told them that "we had been to the wrong house".  I will repeat it again Chairperson, I don't know whether we fetched them with the kombi or they walked back, I do not recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Okay, but nevertheless you all then came back to the first house, the original house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You were driving the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Did you park the kombi and get into the house or what is the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> They got into the house again while the rest of us were in the car, Norma Shosha came to the car to tell us, let me put it this way, she said to us these people were actually playing games, if we arrest them, they will - and get out of this area, then we would be in a position to ask them questions because we had been warned before that there is one exit and one entrance into Chesterville at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And so what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I said to her "go back to the house, the rest of us will follow."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Did you follow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> If I recall, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You went into the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Myself, M.S. Radebe, S. Monyoa, Aubrey Mogadi and Chris  Magoba, we do not know the inside of the house.  I said to Norma Shosha there is an AK inside, just come up with a plan and come out and get your guns so that if anything happens, we can defend ourselves, so the three of them came out.  I don't know what reason did they leave behind for them to leave all at the same time, but they left the AK without the magazine and the ammunition.  I don't know the reason for that, maybe it was to show that they trusted them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Just hang on, they left the police AK47 inside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson, it did not have a magazine and rounds, if I recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And then they came back to the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> All the other unknown persons inside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> They were still inside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> So when the other police officers left the AK47 and went to the kombi, the other members just remained inside the house?  Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And then, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> They quickly came to fetch their guns and they went back into the house.  If I remember well, Norma Shosha came to, we knew that we were supposed to arrest them, but we did not know their plan inside, she came out, she said "Simon,  there is nothing that we can do, except to arrest these people".  I said "well, let us also get out of the car", all of us then went out of the car and we surrounded the house and we stood at the windows so that each one, when one was trying to escape through the window, we would be in a position to arrest him or her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Just hang on, the - what was the reason that the AK47 was left inside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> To prove to them that they trusted them Chairperson.   It was empty, it did not have a magazine and it did not have ammunition.  Yes, this was negligence, but if it was the way to win their trust, so was it done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Now, a decision now is taken that the people have to be arrested, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Why should they be arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Because they pointed, they gave us a wrong house.  We wanted Charles whose surname I did not know and whose appearance I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Charles Ngcobo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I do not want to lie, up to today I only know him as Charles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, Mr Ramawele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.    So now you take a decision to arrest the inmates because they gave a wrong number of a house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> They were asked about Charles, whether they know him and they provided us with a wrong address, now we thought that Charles was around, they were trying to hide him, now by arresting them, they would be in a position to reveal his whereabouts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Tell the hearing, your purpose to go there was to infiltrate them, after infiltrating them, what was your next instruction to be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> The infiltration plan was to arrest them.  Had they gone with us into the kombi, if I do not remember the whites were left behind, we would be in a position to take them with and go and join our colleagues, now all of them were going to be arrested, an ambush kind of a thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You see, you are talking about an ambush and arrest, tell me, when going there you knew that you were going to arrest the inhabitants of that particular house, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We were going to infiltrate them and if ever it goes according to our plans, if they were co-operative, we were going to pretend as if all of us were getting arrested.  We would not arrive there and say to our colleagues "arrest them", the plan was that we would be arrested, all of us.  But we knew that we would be released at some point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> So really your purpose to go there, really you really wanted to go and arrest, take these people, ambush these people, that is what you were supposed to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We were not supposed to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You were supposed just to infiltrate only?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We were supposed to infiltrate them.  If they were willing to go with us, we were going to drive passed where our colleagues would be waiting for us, and we would give them a sign.  That is called ambush, it would have been an arrest because we told them that we were the comrades and all of us were going somewhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> What did you want from them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Sgt Nortje received information that Charles  was responsible for the killing of municipal police and the South African Police in Chesterville.   Maybe the policemen around this area were known to this people and they did not know us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Mr de Kock spoke about the killing of two or three Security Police officers in Durban, are you talking about the police officers who were killed, are you referring to the same police officers, are they one and the same people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I do not know whether me and Mr de Kock are talking about one incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> The difference now is that you are talking about municipal police and a policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, that is why I am saying I do not know whether me and Mr de Kock are on the same par, but that is how Willie told me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I see.  Now you have now taken the decision now to arrest the people who were inside, you have surrounded the house and they are inside, was it dark outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Was it very dark, that you couldn't see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, it was at nine, past ten to eleven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And the light inside the house, was it on or was it off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> The lights were on, but the globe seemed to be dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> From outside, could you see inside, could you see people inside or were you not in a position to see any person from inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> There were closed curtains, I would not be in a position to see inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Did any of the police officers report to you prior to your surrounding the house, that the people inside the house had firearms?  In other words whether they were armed or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Nobody told us, we did not know anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> So at that stage whilst you surrounded the house, you did not have information that the people inside were armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Those who were inside knew, but they did not tell me anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Now, yes, then what happened, you surrounded the house, it is dark, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I told Norma Shosha that we must arrest them, I said to her it would be appropriate those who were inside the house that we are arresting them, I do not recall who was outside and I gave an instruction in Zulu, I said "let us arrest them" and there was fire coming out of the house and we fired back.   Because there were two shacks next to each other, we decided to go to the kombi and we went to C R Swart and we started taking the statements about what happened in Chesterville.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You are saying, you said that now "let us arrest them" and at that time you said shots began to be fired from the inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Ramawele, please just translate what the witness said.  I didn't hear what the witness said about a single shot?  What?  Did you translate that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Chairperson, the Interpreter's microphone was not on, the Interpreters have requested Mr Radebe to repeat the response.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh, okay, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> When I said "let us arrest them", there was one fire coming from outside, from inside, we then returned fire.  I don't know whether it was our fire with their fire, but there was gunfire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Was it just a single shot that you heard coming from the inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, the first time, yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Was it a shanty dwelling or what was it wherein the shot came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> It came through the window and the glasses were shattered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Who was standing next to the window wherein the shot came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> There was no one, you would stand next to the window, but not in front of the window, because you would not know what would follow thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Radebe, when that first single shot rang out, were there some of your people still inside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> They were outside Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All of your people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> If I recall well, yes.   It was dark, but if I recall well, they were all outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Ramawele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   You say outside that window where in the shot came from, there was no police officer who was standing just next to that window, there was no person standing next to that window?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> There was no person in front of the window, but at the front and at the back, there were people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And then all police officers returned fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> How many of you returned fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Myself, Solomon Monyoa, Sgt Aubrey Mogadi, Const Andries Seleka, Const Magagi, Const Chris Magopa and Female Const Shosha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And each one of you fired more than once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> After a shot had come out just once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And that is how you acted in self-defence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is how I see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Now, after shooting, after shooting, did you immediately, did you ran away from the scene or what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We did not run away, we left.   The road was not well, so we drove, we left just okay, we went into the kombi and we drove off and we went to report to Sgt Nortje and we went to C R Swart the next day.  I think it was after a day or two we gave in our statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You did not rush away from the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We did not rush away, I told you already that the road was not well, we were going to get an accident and there would be injuries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You also did not run away from the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We wanted to be as quick as possible, but we were very careful, we did not know if one of them had a handgrenade and threw it at us, we would all die, so everything was done quickly, but very carefully.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> When you went away, was there any shot that was fired at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I do not recall, I don't recall having heard that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> So you were also not chased out of that particular premises?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Now why didn't you go into the house to inspect what happened?  You wanted those people and they shot at you, you shot back, they are not retaliating, why didn't you go back and check because you might find a survivor and he might be of importance to you because you want those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I want to repeat this Chairperson, and say it was possible for them to throw a handgrenade to us, so we had to leave because we were told that there is only one entrance into and one exit out of the area.  We knew exactly which route to follow, that is why we did not get into the house, we tried by all means.  We did not leave in a hush, no, we reported this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Mr Radebe, please just understand my question, you have been an operator of Vlakplaas for a long time, and you are not a coward when it comes to the Security operations, you were not, were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I am trying to respond.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Just listen to my question, my question to you is when you left, after the shooting, there were no retaliation from the inmates of the house, is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And you were never fired at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And you were not in a hurry to leave the place, you just went to your kombi and you went away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.   We did not have bullets, we had used our magazines.  Had other people come to join in the fight, how were we going to protect ourselves?  We were supposed to leave then to go and report to our white seniors, there was a military camp and a police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Just confine yourself to what I am asking you, I am just asking you, when you left the scene, there was quietness, there was no retaliation, nothing, you went into the kombi, you went away, that is what I am asking you, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I am saying to you again that those people inside the house, you wanted them because they had to give certain information about Charles, you wanted them, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> That is why I am asking you, these people shot at you, they are in the house, it is quiet, they are not retaliating, you are police officers, you've got your firearms, you are police officers, why didn't you get inside the house to check these people and abduct a survivor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Our magazines were empty, our guns could only carry eight bullets, we had been told before that this area is dangerous, it was then necessary to leave quickly to report to the superiors so that the right people in this area could go and check.  I think I am responding properly to your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You emptied your magazines after a single shot was fired at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, we did not know what would follow thereafter.  If you hear gunfire, you don't know what to expect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I put it to you that the reason why you emptied you know your ammunition was simply because that was an identified target that you had to eliminate, as simple as that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is not so.  Had it been so, it would not be necessary for us to get an AK47 and show it to them.  We were doing that to win their confidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And furthermore that you were actually travelling on foot and you went, you rushed off from the scene, to the bridge, where Nofomela and others then went over to the police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Repeat your question, we left in a hurry to the kombi at the bridge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I am putting to you that you then after the shooting, you then rushed and got your transport from the bridge where Mr Nofomela was waiting for you and the other police officers, including Mr de Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Maybe my learned friend should just repeat the question properly in the sense that he put it to them that they left on foot and I don't think Mr Radebe has had time to respond to that, or the opportunity to respond to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, will you include that Mr Ramawele and perhaps give it in short bits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I put it to you that from the scene of the shooting, you left on foot because you also came on foot to the bridge?  What do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is sheer lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> You say Nofomela is lying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Why would he lie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Because I was the driver of the kombi, let him tell you what he wants, but I was the driver of the kombi.  I am not telling a hearsay, I am telling you what I was doing.  I remember, if I recall well, there was another kombi, that we left on foot Chairperson, that is a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> According to you the people at the bridge, they knew precisely where you had gone to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct, because when before - on our way to the camp to get the information, we were with Sgt Willie Nortje, Sgt Steve Bosch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I just wish to inform you that Mr Vermeulen testified that they wouldn't have been in a position to assist you guys if you were in trouble, because they did not know where you had gone to and they had absolutely no idea where you had gone to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, they only followed the map, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> But according to him, let me put it this way then, why were they waiting at the bridge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> It was during the violent times in Chesterville, we also took a risk by getting into that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Is it true that you know, one of the ways in which Security Police officers operated was that they you know, in order to avoid being suspected, they would just use a taxi to go to a particular place, then people would not easily suspect?  You as a Security Police officer just get into a taxi, go to a particular place where you want to infiltrate other people, is it possible that that was done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> It never occurred where I was involved to be given a taxi fair or to tell someone to get a taxi.  I only heard about it, I have never experienced it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Have you heard about a situation where the Commander or the person in control will drop you off at a particular point and then you will walk to a particular place where you will then try and make your contacts on foot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I put it to you that on this particular day, that was the similar situation on this particular day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is not correct.  I want to repeat that is not correct.  Chairperson, I am telling you what is the truth, I was the driver of the kombi.  I can give you the telephone numbers of one of them who is still alive today, or just call anybody who was involved in this, ask him under whose name was that kombi, he will tell you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Under whose name was it?  Under whose name was the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> It was in my name, it was in my name, sir.  I was in charge of that kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh do you mean that it was allocated to you by Mr de Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what number plates did it have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> It had many registration numbers, but I have just forgotten the real SAP number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Ramawele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   You are saying also that Mr de Kock was not there at the bridge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> He was at the barracks, at the C R Swart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> How do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Willie told me that they were going to the C R Swart to tell de Kock what happened, he said we can go and sleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> Where was Jeff Bosigo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> The people I saw, I gave your their names already, if there were any other people, I did not see them because I went to sleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I put it to you further on that Mr Nofomela actually drove with you guys to the bridge where he dropped you off and you came back and you, and you came back from Chesterville and boarded his kombi and went back to C R Swart police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I want to repeat, he is lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> And lastly I put it to you also that at the time when you were shooting, you were not acting in self-defence?  You were eliminating those people as instructed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Nobody instructed us to eliminate them, it was only when we heard a bullet coming out of the window, that we returned fire, nobody gave us permission to eliminate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMAWELE:</span> I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a> FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR RAMAWELE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Ramawele.  Mr Cornelius, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> I don't have any questions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR CORNELIUS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Cornelius.  Mr Shezi, questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR SHEZI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Radebe, what were your instructions from Willie Nortje in terms of going to Chesterville, the specific instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We were told to infiltrate the comrades and if they were co-operative, we would be in a position to know who Charles was, and Charles was the person to be arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> And if they were not co-operative, what was the alternative?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We were going to arrest them all, all who were present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Were you told which house to go to, you spoke about being shown the wrong house, which house specifically were you told to go to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I think there is a number somewhere in the statement, but the second house that I referred to as being the wrong house, is the house we were told that Charles was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> You said you had forgotten the house number?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> In your evidence you said you when Shosha had come to collect the AK47, you emptied the magazine and then she took it without any magazine, you just left it there in the kombi, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is according to the instructions, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Sorry, you said he emptied the magazine, didn't they take out the magazine and kept it apart from the gun, I don't know whether they in fact emptied, they spoke about bullets separately from the magazine, but I don't know whether they emptied the magazine or whether they had bullets apart from those in the magazine, I am not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Mr Chairman, from what I believe he said is that he - the AK was without bullets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes, that is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> To the point that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes, you are quite correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you want to clarify that perhaps if you want to, with him precisely what they did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Radebe, the AK that was given to Shosha, the bullets, you took them out and they remained with you in the car, sorry can I finish, so at the time she left with it to show to the comrades as it were, it was empty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, it did not have the magazine and the bullets, but the bullets were still inside the magazine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> But that all remained with you in the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> So if one of the members that went to the house might have said in his statement that the magazine and bullets were in the AK and that he emptied those, that would be far from the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, that would not be the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> And if there  is a witness who might have been in the house at that time to say the AK was emptied in my presence, or the bullets and magazine were emptied in my presence, that would also be far from the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That would not be the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> On the Bundle of documents, the Supplementary Bundle where there are statements of all the operatives on page 8, I wonder if you have that in front of you?  On page 8 is a statement by Mohai (indistinct) Seleka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I think I mentioned that there was a time they came back to take the magazine, I think I mentioned that that they came back to fetch the magazine.  I just mentioned that they came to fetch the magazine, I did not mention that they came to fetch bullets and the magazine, the magazine had bullets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Are you adding that now, because you did not say that earlier on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> No Mr Chairman, with due respect he did say that.  Just after the comrades came back, they did come to fetch the magazine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what Mr Shezi says is that you haven't said it earlier on, he said that you haven't said it when he, Mr Shezi, was asking him, that is the point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Oh.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   Also when you were being cross-examined by Mr Ramawele you said you arrested these persons or rather you intended to arrest them or rather you made that decision purely on the basis that they had shown you the wrong house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, when they came back from the house that I said was up the hill, after Shosha came to tell me that they were playing games I said "yes, they must be arrested."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> So in other words you are confirming that the decision to arrest them was purely on the basis that they were sending you on a wild goose chase as it were, if I could use that phrase?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> In our decision we suspected that  we do not know Charles' appearance, facial appearance, he might be among them, we did not even know if at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Among those which were in the house, was there any description that fitted Charles according to the report which was made to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I did not get into the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> This is why I have said according to the report that was made to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We did not have a photo to compare.  We did not have a photo to compare and see how Charles looks like.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> So on what basis did you have this suspicion that Charles might be among them, hence you suspected that they were playing games if you did not even have the foggiest idea of what he looked like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We suspected that Charles was among them, arresting them would be a solution, we would arrest them and their fingerprints would be taken.  The fingerprints would tell who was who.   Because he was wanted by the police in Chesterville, they would be in a position to identify him, we did not know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Had they been asked about Charles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> The reason to go up the hill was to go and find Charles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> All right, on the bundle of documents which I referred to earlier on, on page 14 is a statement by Xolela (indistinct) and Nompulela Shosha.  On page 16, I draw your attention specifically to page 16, the last paragraph, line 8, I will read it out to you, she says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a>"... I did not see any weapons but the handgrenades could have easily been concealed."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a>	Sorry, let me just start at the beginning of the paragraph.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a>"... I then left alone, leaving Const Seleka and Magagi behind.  I found our vehicle a distance away and made a report to the other members and Sgt Radebe, I informed them that they were at the wrong spot and I will show them the way.  On the way I informed them that the comrades in the shack was in possession of handgrenades and intending to attack Chesterville and Umbilo police stations."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a>	She goes on to say -</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a>"... I did not see any weapons, but the handgrenades could have easily been concealed.  I also told them that Charles was with other comrades in the shack and that Const Seleka and Magagi was alone with them."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a>	Was this report made to you as Const Shosha is saying here, this is what she said she told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I do not recall her telling me about a handgrenade, maybe she did report to me, but I do not recall, that is why that is not included in my statement.  I do not recall her telling me about that, she might have told me, I have forgotten.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> She might have told you that there was Charles among them, the guy that you were looking for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No, she did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> I will proceed on page 17, at the beginning of that paragraph.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a>"... I requested them to bring our vehicle closer to the shack where Const Seleka and Magagi was.  I proceeded to the shack and they followed me.  On our arrival at the shack, Sgt Radebe requested me to call Const Seleka and Magagi outside as he wanted to speak to them.  He told us that we must arrest the occupants of the house."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a>	Do you remember that episode?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I recall saying that we should arrest them, the kombi was nearby, there was no necessity to pull it closer.  The kombi was about 20 to 25 metres from the house and to get to the house, one would have to go up the stairs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> So you said "arrest them", for what?  I mean did you tell Shosha, Seleka and Magagi why should they arrest them, or what was the reason for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I did not give them any reason, I said "let us arrest them", that was after I have told Shosha that the best thing would be to arrest them, because we have been told before about the situation in this area and I said the policemen of this area will tell us whether Charles is among the people, because they had been also looking for him.  Surely the district police would know him, they always knew their victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> If Mr Chairman could bear with me.    Thank you Mr Chairman.  Your group, Shosha, Seleka and Magagi, they had established a rapport with the occupants of the shack, hence they went back to collect the AK and later to collect the magazine, some good relationship had been established, a relationship of trust if one could use the word?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> It is only Shosha who came out, Magagi and Seleka were left behind.  It was Shosha and one comrade who was inside the house, who came out and I think I mentioned that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> I am now saying at the time of the incident at the shack where the shooting took place, prior to the shooting, at some point was there a relationship established, a good relationship or a relationship of trust between that group and the operatives where they began to trust them because they had shown them an AK?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Shosha and a comrade came to me, came to us and I said "Shosha, you know that the firearms are hidden at the cemetery."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Radebe, it is a simple question.  He is asking you whether after the AK had been shown to them, they trusted your people?  Do you know, after it had been shown to them, whether they trusted your people or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> It seems so, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Mr Radebe, my instructions are that kind of relationship having been established whereby the occupants in a shack had told them their difficulties in the township, Seleka and Magagi all went out, ostensibly to fetch firearms, more firearms for them and all that followed thereafter was just shooting.  Are you in a position to deny that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I deny that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> On what basis are you denying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We actually approached to the house to tell them that they must come out of the house, I - that is the basis along which I disagree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Sorry, would you repeat your answer again, sorry, I missed out something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I disagree because these people went first into the house, before there was a shoot-out, then they had to come out.  I spoke in Zulu, I said "let us arrest them", there was then fire from inside and the window panes shattered and we returned fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> So you told your operatives, they were all together when you said "let's arrest them", they were all together at the same time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We were all outside at the windows.  If I am not mistaken, there were two windows and a door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> So if somebody was to say Seleka and Magagi were left inside the shack when Shosha had gone out, she came back and she whispered something to them, they then went out with her, seconds later, then there was firing, what would you say to that?  There wasn't a point in time when the occupants were left alone  in a shack, they were always under guard if one could use that phrase?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I would not agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> You are saying that if somebody would come and testify before this Commission to that, they would not be telling the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> As I understand correctly, at a time she went in, whispered to them and they all came out, and that was just before the shooting.  At that time, at the point of shooting, they were all outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes.  And you put it to him that they were never left alone, but at that very moment, they were left alone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Oh yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Is that correct that she called them outside and thereafter the shooting followed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> She called them outside and I issued out an order "let us arrest them" and there was shooting.  The shooting did not take place immediately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> When you came to give the instruction that they must be arrested, did you come and immediately take positions and then tell them or you told them "let's arrest them", then you took positions, what happened, can you just explain that scenario?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We were not in positions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> If you intended to arrest them, there was no need for Shosha to call the two members outside, it was supposed for you to get inside and start arresting them, what do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We must remember that we were risking, I did not want others, some of us to survive and others to be trapped, I wanted this action to take place all at the same time so that if they were nine and we were six, the three could leave and run away, we wanted to arrest them all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> By Shosha calling them outside, it would appear you were getting those members out of the trouble so that you can start shooting, what do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I do not agree to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And at the time your members were called out, there was no indication that any of the comrades were armed, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Nobody told me or indicated to me that they were armed, I did not know anything about them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> At what stage was the AK47 removed from the shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Const Magagi came out of the shack in possession of an AK47, I think I did explain Chairperson, because I mentioned earlier on that he was heavily built.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And Seleka came out with the magazines?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I do not know what happened thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> When you were emptying your guns, were you shooting through the windows, the door or throughout the shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We were shooting even the walls because the house was built of mud.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did anyone of you use the AK47 in the shooting at the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I think Magagi used an AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Shezi, you can continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.    Didn't you know the number of the people who were inside that shack, as to how many of them were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> So are you saying Shosha never told you that there are so many occupants in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> She did not tell me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> So when you gave the order that they must be arrested, you didn't - sorry, can I finish - you didn't know how many people you were going to arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I did not know, you are quite correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> How many doors did that shack have, was it only one door where they were coming in and out or was there another one elsewhere?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> There was one door and two windows if I recall well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> There was a question which was asked by members of the panel why was it necessary for you to call these other members out, why wouldn't you have just gone inside and say "you are under arrest" and arrest them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I said we were infiltrating and infiltration differs from an arrest.  Arrest would be totally different, if we arrive, we would be told that the person that we want is not present.  Infiltration is different from arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes, we understand that, but now you have infiltrated them, you have gained certain information and at a stage you decide to arrest, why was it necessary to bring your people out of the shack before you arrest, why couldn't you go in and say "hands up" or whatever or go to them and arrest them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Those of us who were outside, did not know the inside of the house, we did not know the positions of each inside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes, but you had three members inside the house who knew all about, or knew the positions of the house at that stage.  Why was it necessary to bring them out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> They did not tell us how many people were inside, we did not know how many people were inside.  Each time when you arrest, you have to know whether there is a sitting room, a dining room, we did not know whether house was a kitchen or something else.  We wanted them to come out and there were others around, guarding the windows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> What would better your position, if you are all outside now, you still don't know whether there is a kitchen, whether there is a bathroom, whether there are how many rooms, you have brought out the only people who would know and they don't tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Chairperson, that is why we even spoke in Zulu "let us arrest them", we did not speak the language unknown to them.  Had we not mentioned that in Zulu, I think the bullet issue would not have taken place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What does that have to do with the question?  How does it explain the question that my colleague had asked you?  Shosha who was inside the house, who had close contact with these people, were actually outside with you, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now the question that was raised was, why was it necessary to get the other two out, why didn't you just go in, you are five outside, two of your people are inside, why didn't you just go inside and arrest these people if that is what you wanted to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Chairperson, that was our modus operandi, what if the person we were looking for, would get out of the door and run away from us and remain with the rest of the group in the house?  That is the reason we called them out, was that we should as soon as possible finish with the arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but I mean how were you going to arrest them if you don't go into the house?   How do you arrest them if you take all your people out of the house?  Are you not supposed to, well, I don't know unless you say that is how you operated, I don't know how you do arrests, but I am a lay person, I don't know.  How do you do arrests if you go out of the place where the people are in that you want to arrest?  That is the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Chairperson, we knew that we were going to arrest all of them if our members were outside.   What if we call everybody outside and one of the people is Charles and he runs away, now if our people are outside, all of them are outside, obviously the ones remaining inside, will be arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, perhaps.  Sorry, Mr Shezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman.  Mr Radebe, you know about house penetration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> You have conducted such an operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> That would mean that some of you would remain at the windows, maybe others at the door and there would be people who can come in and that is called house penetration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> I am saying, was it not the best thing or wouldn't you agree that it was going to be better to conduct a house penetration in that Shosha was in a better position to come in and outside of the house, she would have just whispered to the other members of your team to say that now you are going to conduct a house penetration and you could have easily arrested these people without anyone, possibly Charles, running away, what is your comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I do not agree to your statement Chairperson, we did not know what was happening inside the house.  The problem would be inside, if Shosha gets into the house and whispers to the other two people, what would be the impression created out of that?  They would ask themselves why does she not speak openly, I don't know whether I am responding to your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But she did whisper to them because they were able to come out of the house, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I called them, I don't know whether she whispered anything to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Shezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you had done this operation that my colleague refers to as house penetration, you were seven in your contingent, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And there were two windows?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you were five outside?  So if you put two people at the windows, you are three left, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then you still have two people inside?  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you have outside with you Shosha, who has been involved in this thing, she could give you any information that you wanted, not so?  She could have told you there was a kitchen and a sitting room and there are five people inside, or whatever the case might be, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.  Chairperson, if someone inside had an AK47 and we get into the house, and they start shooting, that would be a risk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but you would take the risk, you wanted to arrest them, that is neither here nor there, unless I misunderstand it.  The point I am trying to ask you to respond to is then you would have had two people at the two windows where people could possibly go out, you've got five people that could go inside the house and do the arrest, because you would be able to cover the doors as well, what was the problem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> The problem is we did not trust them at all, because they had lied already, telling us someone is at a house up the hill.  We had been to the house up the hill, it was a wrong house, there was no trust at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Well, could you tell us, suppose there wasn't a shooting, what would have happened, how would you have arrested the people if you were all standing outside and they were inside?  What would the next step be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Two people would be at the window and the rest would guard the door, but just after finishing with our plan, there was gunfire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But tell me, how would you carry out the arrest if you people are standing outside and they inside and there is no gunshots now being fired, what would you do, how would you get hold of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We were going to kick the door open and arrest them inside because we would know that no one of our members is inside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you would take the two out, to just take them back in again?  You would take the two out and just to take them back in again, to arrest these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> There were no positions given to each one at that time, people just placed themselves at the windows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but I mean on what actually happened there, the two of your members that were still inside when Shosha was outside with you, all you basically was then going to do, all that you were going to do was to take them out, right, you called them out, Shosha whispered there to them and they go out and then you all go in again and then you arrest these people, or you leave two at the window or whatever you were going to do.  We don't understand how people affect an arrest, I have never arrested anybody in my life.  I am just trying to understand how the arrest would work and that is why we have been asking you to explain so that we can also understand.  Mr Shezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, maybe just one more question, on page 20 of that document, last paragraph, can you have a look at that.  It says, this is your statement by the way, just to tell you, it says you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a>"... at the spot where Const Shosha pointed out, I saw a wooden shack and there was a coloured light in the shack.  When we got out to the spot and we all go out, that is the five of us, as we got to the shack, I saw a window and a door in the front and we took up position outside."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a>	Why did you take up position outside the shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Shosha had told us already that we must arrest them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> So now it is Shosha who told you to arrest them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No, she came to the kombi and said these people are lying, can we arrest them and I said "let us arrest them", but I said that in Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Where did you tell Shosha this,  at the kombi or when she came to tell you, where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Telling me what sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> You said Shosha came to say to you at the kombi that "these people are lying to us, I think we should arrest them", now, Shosha was telling you this at the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> So when you came, you came and you took up positions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We did not know the position of the house, we walked up to the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> I am talking about the shack now which is outside the house, a shack, just one-room shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I am referring to that as well.  Those of us who were in a kombi, did not know the house, the structure of the house.  We went out to approach the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Just two issues to put to you, I put it to you that there was never any decision to arrest these people, all that was devised was a scam to group together as many comrades as you could in one spot and then shoot them?  Can you comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is not so, they were already there.  Had we had a meeting with them before, it would have been another issue, we did not, we find them already at that spot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> The taking up of positions which is referred to in your statement was part of the plan that you were about to start shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> It was not.    If it was our plan, they would not start by shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> The decision to tell Shosha to call out some of the members, was because you were about to start and you did not want to shoot with your members inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is not correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHEZI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, that will be all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SHEZI</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Shezi.  Ms Patel, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS PATEL:</span> Just clarity Honourable Chairperson.  Mr Radebe, do you know that two of the deceased were shot and killed, were shot in the back and died as a result of those bullet wounds?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I do not know that chairperson, I only heard that people died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> And the police officer who had arrived on the scene, Mr van Rooyen, had described the position of the bodies, the positions in which he found the bodies at the scene and he states that the one person was found halfway under the bed and the other person was laying on the bed, on his stomach?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I did not get into the house after the shooting, I did not get into the house to check.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> And he also states further that two bodies were found laying next to each other at the entrance near the door, with their heads facing the door?  It would appear as if they were trying to get out at least, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I do not know, I mentioned that after the shooting we left, I did not check.  I am now talking on my behalf, I do not know what happened.  I told them "let's go and report."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> None of your members went into the house to shoot, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> We all left.  I would not disagree with that, but all of us withdrew and all of us told each other that our magazines were empty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we hear that but the question is did some of your people go into the house and shot, fired shots inside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1545"><a name="pos1545"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Ms Patel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, and the only shot that came from inside of the house, was the one shot you heard, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Yes, that is the bullet that led us to returning fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> You cannot dispute that at least 20 spent cartridges were found inside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> I would not disagree with you, I do not know how many cartridges were found.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Thank you Honourable Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS PATEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Ms Patel.   Does the panel have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> I've got no questions Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Hugo, have you got anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR HUGO:</span> Yes, thank you  Mr Chairperson.  Mr Radebe, did any of the policemen and or the askaris fire shots from within the shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> No policemen, no askari, shot from inside the shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Did you, before the other two or three were also asked to come out of the shack, were you suspicious at that stage that the occupants inside the shack, might be armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> After they directed us to a wrong house, we suspected that they were armed or there were other comrades nearby.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Is that one of the reasons why it ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Why it was arranged for these three to also get out of the house or the shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR HUGO</p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Hugo.  Mr Radebe, thank you very much, you are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADEBE:</span> Thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We have come to the end of the day.  Mr Hugo, have you got any other witnesses that you intend to call?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> I don't have any further witnesses Mr Chairman.  May I also ask to be excused from tomorrow onwards if it is at all possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.  Mr Radebe, you are excused, that thing seems to have a negative effect on you?   We suspect that there isn't very much left in this matter, so we would like to finish it off as quickly as we can, we would ask your co-operation if we can start the proceedings slightly earlier tomorrow than we have been starting up to now.   For that reason, we would adjourn the proceedings and reconvene here tomorrow morning at nine o'clock and hopefully get through with the proceedings at a decent hour.  We are adjourned.</p>
