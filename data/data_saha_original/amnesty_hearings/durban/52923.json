            "IN ARGUMENT Thank you, Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen.  I submit that if one looks at the evidence before this Committee today, which to a very very large extent has been corroborated in substantial and material respects by the Judgment of Judge Nicholson.\n\tThe picture emerges that just prior to the 1994 elections the area of Bottlebrush became ungovernable due to the rise in prominence and in numbers and in strength of a gang known as \"The Mafia\" gang.  \n\tThe area which was an exclusive ANC area and had an ANC branch formed in it, the community looked to the ANC to provide the governance that was lacking from the government of the day.\n\tVarious efforts were attempted, including resorting to the assistance of the police and no help ...[indistinct] the way of the community.  The community tried its own endeavours, firstly by talking to the parents of the criminals concerned, in some instances assaulting them and in some instances banishing them but the problem didn't disappear.  The entire situation became unbearable and when the two young girls were raped, the community almost ...[indistinct] passed a sentence against these people.  \n\tLooking at it in retrospect, as Judge Nicholson pointed out that the death penalty has in fact been declared unconstitutional, but one must look at the prevailing circumstances at that time.  The community had no other option, they tried every other available means and it was the responsibility of the ANC to provide leadership and get rid of the criminal element.  \tIn that instance the three applicants were acting in furtherance of a political purpose, that is to provide governance which was lacking by the government of the day.  And in those instances I submit with respect, that the applicants have made out a case for amnesty and their actions were political and were necessary, given the circumstances that prevailed and the time and era in which it occurred.\n\tI'm therefore asking with respect, that the three applicants be given amnesty.",

The applications seem to fall fairly and squarely within the purport of Section 20 of the Act, particularly (2).  The evidence is clear that the conduct of the applicants indicate an act associated with a political objective.  \tThere doesn't seem to have been any evidence regarding any personal gain and it would seem from the Judgment of His Lordship, Mr Justice Nicholson, that when they sought out the members of \"The Mafia\" responsible for these acts of terror, in fact they had the community in large numbers with them.\n\tMr Chairman, I don't have anything further to add and then leave the ultimate decision in the hands of the Committee.",

            "...[inaudible] applicants in respect of the murder of certain persons on the 26th of December 1993.  We have had put before us Indictment, Summary of Substantial Facts and Judgment relating to that case and I don't consider it necessary to set out any of the details.  We have also of course got the applications of the three applicants.\n\tIt is clear from the Judgment and from the evidence that was led before us today, that the killings took place in an area known as Bottlebrush, which was an ANC area and where the ANC committees sought to provide some form of government for the local community.\n\tThere is evidence that a gang known as \"The Mafia\" was causing havoc in the area, committing crimes of violence such as robbery, rape and that despite requests the police appeared to be unable to do anything to prevent the recurrence of these offences.\n\tThe community thereafter looked at the ANC and the representatives of the ANC for assistance.  All three applicants were either members or office bearers of the ANC at the time.  \n\tIt is clear from the Judgment and the evidence that they took what steps they could to try to stop the gang behaving as they did but were unable to do so and finally on the day in question were driven to desperation by the kidnapping and multiple gang-rape of some young girls the night before.\n\tIt is not necessary in my view to set out any detailed reasoning, that I refer to the Judgment which deals concisely with all that happened and to the argument advanced before us today by Mr Samuel, who also sets out sucintly the basis on which the application is brought before us and the reason why in his submission it should be granted.\n\tWe are satisfied that the three applicants acting on behalf of the ANC which was seeking to provide governance and assistance to the community, acted to prevent further crime, acted to support the community view that they could look to the ANC for assistance.  And this is in our view certainly an act committed with a political objective. \n\tThe conditions existing at that time were such that people could feel they were driven to violence.  It is of course no longer an excuse for anyone to continue to take the law into their own hands in such a way but in the circumstances that existed then, we feel it is not an act of such a nature that the applicants should be deprived of amnesty because of the brutality of the  act.  \n\tWe accordingly GRANT THE APPLICATION FOR AMNESTY OF ALL THREE APPLICANTS in respect of the killing of the persons set out in the indictment.  \n\tNone of the victims have been present here today but we have been given a list which we'll submit to the \nR & R Committee for their consideration.  They are",
