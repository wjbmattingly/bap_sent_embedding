<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You were just an ordinary member, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> In 1985, we have heard that there was a fight between the UDF and the Inkatha Freedom Party, do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And Mr Sixtus Fana Mkhize was a member of Inkatha and he was a prominent member, the organiser and he participated with the police in the attack on the UDF, do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You have heard the evidence of Nicholas Msani, regarding the activities of Mr Mkhize during the period 1985 to 1990.   Do you consider Mr Msani's evidence as being true and correct in all respects?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes, it is the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Do you specifically confirm that Mr Fana Mkhize, the deceased, participated in the killing of the people and the destruction of property, the people that belonged to the UDF?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> In 1990 you heard that there were SDU's formed, Self Defence Units formed.  Are you aware of the formation of the SDU's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Were you at any stage a member of the SDU's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Was it in 1990 that you became a member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> We have heard that the purpose of the SDU was to protect the society because the UDF people could not protect, could not be protected by the police, the police participated with the attack, with the IFP, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Mr Msani has given evidence that at some stage there was a decision taken to eliminate the deceased, Mr Mkhize.  Are you aware of that decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And he also gave evidence that attempts were made on Mr Mkhize's life on several occasions, were you part of those attempts to eliminate Mr Mkhize?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> In 1990, the 7th of November, we have heard that Mr Mkhize was attacked and you were part of the group that attacked Mr Mkhize.  Was that evidence correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes, it is the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> We have heard that you and the other applicants attacked him.  What was your role, you specifically when Mr Mkhize was attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> I shot at him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> With what did you shoot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> A gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> A factory made firearm or was it a home made firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> A home made gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Where did you get that gun from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> I got it from Fanie, Mr Mbutho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> That is the gentleman that is the third applicant, the one that is going to testify after you, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> When you shot at the deceased, can you recall how many shots you fired at him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> How many?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Where about on his body if you can recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> It was on the back although I cannot point out specifically where, because he was already injured when I shot at him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But when you shot at him, is it correct that he was still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes, he was still alive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you inflict any further injuries on the deceased on that very same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> No, that was the first instance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes, after you had shot him, did you assault him further in any manner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> After you had shot him and after he had been hacked, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> We fled the area because police approached and IFP members as well, so we fled and we hid in the forest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> I see.  When you did that, Mr Msani has given evidence that he believed that he was acting within the realm of the call of the ANC, do you also confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you hope that once Mr Mkhize had been eliminated, there would be, the violence that was perpetrated against the UDF, would subside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes, I thought so because he was one of the people who troubled us a lot in the area.  Therefore I thought that if he could be removed, we would be able to work progressively, because he was one of the people who actually wanted to prevent us from conducting our political work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Is it correct that as you are sitting here, you have been convicted to undergo a period of imprisonment of 20 years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you were convicted by the Supreme Court of South Africa in 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you hear when a portion of what the Judge said in the High Court, was read out to Mr Msani that there was hostility between the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party and that that led to hostility created in you against the deceased and inter alia that that hostility might have influenced you to commit this crime, did you hear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Do you confirm that the position sketched out by the Honourable Judge is more or less the true position of what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You realise that what you did was wrong, against the family and the community of South Africa as such?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Do you wish to say something about your actions and do you have a message to the family of the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Can you say what you wish to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> What I wish to say, I wish the Mkhize family was present so that they could hear what I am saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>	What I did to them, was wrong and I wish to apologise for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Are you prepared to meet them on a man to man basis and apologise to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes, very much.  I would appreciate that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Have you made any attempts to meet them at any stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Can you tell us what attempts you have made and what the result was of those attempts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> At Westville prison, I attempted to get into contact with the Mkhize family.   It was not easy but I contacted the Welfare section in the prison and they were able to telephone the family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>	I had once telephoned them myself, but I also asked the Social Worker to telephone the family.  The Social Worker did this, and they discussed with the family, although I don't know how I can take our discussions further, but I have made that contact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> When you made that contact, were you doing that on your behalf and on behalf of the other two applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Do you feel sorry about what you have done, killing the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> If you were not involved in politics, would you have killed the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> We have heard evidence that when you killed the deceased, the members of his family were also present and did you attempt to kill them at any stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Okay.  Thank you Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NGUBANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Ngubane.  Ms Thabete, do you have any questions to put to the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETE:</span> Just a few Mr Chairperson.  Mr Hlongwa, can you briefly tell the Committee members, how did you join the SDU and what procedure did you go through when you joined the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> There were discussions between ANC leaders.  It transpired that there were no people who protected the community, because the police could not protect the community, especially people who were ANC aligned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>	There was an agreement then that people should be chosen to protect the community.  We therefore met with those people who had been to that meeting, and we were elected to form this branch or to form this unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Can you go back a little bit, who elected you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Bukela Luthuli, he was the person responsible for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what you mean, you were selected rather than elected.  You were chosen or appointed rather than elected?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> You say Mr Mkhize, the deceased, was responsible for attacking the ANC.  Did he used to attack the ANC by himself or were there other people who he usually attacked the ANC with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> He would be in the company of other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> So following that question, was Mr Mkhize the only person you targeted out of all the people that attacked you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> No.  He is not the only person who was targeted, but he was one of the people whom we had targeted to remove.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> Just as a matter of interest and for the record, you say you have tried to contact the deceased's next of kin, who did you speak to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said that you managed yourself to telephone the family.  When you  yourself telephoned the family, do you know who you spoke to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> At the first instance, I requested to speak to that family's elder boy.  I tried a second time, because I wanted to speak to him specifically and I spoke to his mother, and she told me that he no longer resided at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>	Therefore I went to the Social Worker and asked them to speak to the mother because I didn't think that she would appreciate talking to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> You say you phoned to speak to the son of the deceased, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, I understood you to be saying that you spoke to not the son of the deceased, but the son of the family, the oldest son of the family.  Can you clarify that please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLONGWA:</span> It was Nana, the family's eldest boy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the, who was the eldest boy's father, was that the deceased or the deceased's father?</p>
