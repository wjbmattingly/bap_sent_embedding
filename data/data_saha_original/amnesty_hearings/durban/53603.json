If you have Exhibit A which we handed in yesterday, before you, Chairperson, could I ask you to turn to page 20 of Exhibit A and could I ask you and the Members of your Committee to tear out from page 20, the rest of those pages of Exhibit A.  We will now hand to you a document which will run from page 20, which will replace the documents which you've now torn out.\n\tMr Chairman, while we're about handing up to you documents, we have prepared for you an extract from the written presentation made by the Foundation for Equality before the Law.  You will recall, Chairperson, that that's quite a thick document.  I've got one in my hand.  You will recall - you will remember when you see the cover page, what that document looks like.  We're not going to deal with that whole document.  What we've done is we have extracted Chapter 17 from that document and Ms Thabethe has kindly assisted in making copies for you, Chairperson, and we will ask you to accept that as Exhibit B, which we'll hand up to you.

Chairperson, this document was made available to us by the TRC on the last occasion when we appeared before your brother, Justice Wilson, Malan and Sigodi, in the other applications concerning Natal incidents.  \n\tWe make that available to you, Chairperson.  We won't specifically rely on it, we're not even certain whether all the detail here is correct.  But it is an interesting document.

That weapons of war were smuggled by and through Swaziland to the RSA.  That a great deal of terrorists had left the RSA and after they had completed their military training, had returned to the RSA via Swaziland.  That there was an extensive network of safehouses and other facilities with which terrorists were supported.  That financial and logistical support was provided to such persons in Swaziland.\n\t\tDue to the geographical proximity of Natal to Swaziland, the activities of the liberation movements in Swaziland became known to Natal.  The Security Branch Eastern Transvaal was naturally also affected by this.  Due to their intelligence capacity, the Security Branch was kept up to date very well with activities and personalities and their activities in Swaziland.  \n\t\tThe Security Branch was up to date regarding who the ANC operatives were and what their intentions were.  By means of well-placed informers they regularly received information regarding the terrorists and weaponry that would enter the RSA, as well as the routes along which they would travel, as well as the situation of the DLBs and safehouses.  The DLBs actually refer to weapon stockpiling location and not necessarily points of information.  They also had knowledge about safehouses, contact persons and so forth, which placed them in a capacity to act in future.\n\t\tSwaziland also played an important role in the execution of the ANC/SACP alliance's Operation Butterfly and Operation Vula.  In Swaziland certain structures had been established by the ANC/SACP alliance and had been operated as such.

Kasrils' idea was that the internal bases of power had to be established by advanced attachments of MK.\n'The development of the armed struggle is dependent on its being rooted among the people.  Our MK combatants and organisers must therefore base themselves amongst the people in order to involve the masses in a people's war.'\n\t\tTrained MK cadres had to activate the masses politically:\n'The armed struggle must compliment mass struggle and we seek to combine all forms of struggle, violent and non-violent, legal and illegal.'\n\t\tThe underlying strategy was:\n'Political and strategy determines military strategy and our combatants and organisers must be imbued with political theories and ideas, must understand politics guides the gun.'\n\t\tThe central concept for the operation was that a power basis had to be established within the borders of South Africa, which would replace the necessity to leave the country to obtain training and swallows the necessity of receiving orders from outside the country.  \n\t\tKasrils' idea of a basis of power within the country was accepted by the ANC/SACP alliance, but the viewpoint was that it was ANC leaders and not MK cadres who would have create the basis of power and politicise the masses.  There would have to be an abbreviation of the communication from the front of the struggle to the head office in Lusaka.\n\t\tThe operation would have three corner stones, namely: a) political combat work, military combat work and the intelligence work, specifically aimed at the SAP, the South African Defence Force and National Intelligence Services, as well as other targets which would be identified.\n\t\tVula was launched during December 1986 and would be a five year operation.  The ultimate objective was a violent revolution.  Vula's origin was preceded by a preparation phase which had already been initiated in 1984/1985.

Besides the equipment you already have, it appears that Ntabo's outfit, codename for Jacob Zuma, also a member of the NEC, is currently required to store two pieces, codename for firearms, which were in the hands of the enemy group planning Madiba's assassination.  From the description that Ntabo gave me, one of the pieces seems to have an optical sight and given the internesent (there's a comment to say, it should probably mean internecine) struggle within the enemy camp I am attracted to borrowing one of those pieces if it is suitable for use by us, even if on a temporary basis.\"\n\tAnd Chairperson, further down the document it appears that when Mr Nyanda was arrested secretive compartments were found in his car.  At the bottom of page 118 there is a reference to that.  It was a Toyota Cressida and in one of the compartments was found a 45mm submachine gun, serial number so-and-so and an optical night-sight for that weapon.  \n\tChairperson, in the other side of the story the little booklet that was given out by Gen Herman Stadler, on the very last page you will find photographs of that car and the weapon which we've just referred to.\n\tNow just in conclusion with regard to the general background - and I now refer you to Exhibit C, Chairperson.   The first paragraph \"Discovery of Vula\", Dr Henderson says in Exhibit C:\n\"On the weekend of 6 July 1990, the South African Security Police picked up two suspected African National Congress underground operatives in Durban.  Mbuso Shabalala and Charles Ndaba were in fact part of a major ANC underground operation to create the political and military structures necessary for launching a general insurrection - a people's war - within South Africa, a covert operation which had been running for two years unknown to the South African Security Forces.\"\nAnd that refers to the person, Ndaba and Shabalala, who are also the subject of another amnesty application in the current session before the Amnesty Committee here.",
