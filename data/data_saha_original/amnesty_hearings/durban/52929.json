Bongani Cele and Dumisani Sibisi, AM 3383/96 and AM 6351/97 was adjourned from Monday until today.\n\tMr Chairman, may I place on record the following:  Both the applicants were released from prison on parole.  Present today is Mr Dumisani Sibisi who has via his attorney, Mr Samuel indicated that they wish to proceed with the application.  \n\tMr Bongani Cele is not present.  My information that from his parole office, Mr Cele has failed to report on the various occasions that he was supposed to, as a result of which he and members of the witness protection and police went out into the Umzinto area where he resides to try and find him.  He wasn't able to be found. \n\tHowever this morning I learnt from his co-applicant, Mr Sibisi, that he had been requested by the parole officer and also our witness protection, Mr Sadar Govender to possibly see if he could contact Mr Cele, which he did.  Mr Sibisi confirmed this morning to me that he had spoken to Mr Cele the day before yesterday, had explained to him why the matter was adjourned to today and Mr Cele indicated to him that he was not interested in proceeding with his application.  I think Mr Samuel will or I will be able to lead that evidence or ask those questions or possibly the Committee may even confirm that from Mr Sibisi once he is placed under oath.\n\tSo in the circumstances, Mr Chairman, I would submit that it would be equitable that Mr Sibisi be heard insofar as his amnesty application is concerned.  All the victims are present, and there are five.  I have consulted with all of them and they have all indicated to me that they do not oppose the application.  \n\tAnd all have indicated quite magnanimously, Mr Chairman, that they have unconditionally forgiven Mr Sibisi.  The only person that wishes to speak to Mr Sibisi at the end of these proceedings is Mrs Mabel Mahiba or Madiba.  And that will be arranged with Mr Sibisi and his attorney.",

            "Well where does that appear in the application?  The application is only in respect of the murder and the attempted murder.\n\tThe six counts all arise from the same incident, when a group of people attacked a vehicle and killed or sought to kill the passengers.  Two of them, Dodo Joseph Madiba and Khija John Mthembu were killed.  The other four, Ralph Dube, Mamagaluna Khomo, Aaron Mbele and Tokizani Mbele escaped with their lives but in some instances suffered serious injuries.\n\tThis is was yet another of the incidents that arose out of the political tensions that existed in Kwazulu Natal at the time, that is on the 30th of April 1991.  \tIt is clear from the various statements contained in the bundle of papers put before us, that there was extreme tension on both sides and extreme hostility, that a state of almost warfare existed.  There were killings of members of both sections and the applicant has given evidence to the effect that he was an active member of the ANC and of a self-defence unit in the area and that finally the decision was taken that they would have to take some strong action to advance their political prestige and position in the area with a view to ultimately reach some agreement that would result in the killings coming to an end.\n\tIt has not been challenged, nor could it in my view on the information before us, that the acts committed were committed as part of a political group and that the intent was certainly one which could be classified as an act with a political objective.\n\tThey used petrol bombs and shotguns and it was quite clearly a brutal attack in which people were  unfortunately killed.  We have with us today the widows of two of the deceased and also one of the men who has suffered grievous bodily harm.  They have indicated that they do not oppose the application, that they seek reconciliation in the future, for which they are to be praised and thanked.\n\tWe are satisfied that the applicant has made out a case for amnesty and we accordingly GRANT HIM AMNESTY IN RESPECT OF THE MURDER OF DODO JOSEPH MADIBA AND KHIJA JOHN MTHEMBU AT OR NEAR THE SYKOR BRIDGE, UMKOMAAS ON THE 30TH OF APRIL 1991, AND THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF RALPH DUBE MAMAGALUMA KHOMO, AARON MBELE, TOKIZANI MBELE AT THE SAME DATE AND PLACE.\n\tWe are satisfied on the information placed before us, that MRS MARY MADIBA, the widow of the first-named deceased IS A VICTIM and that she has been left a widow with three young children who are still at school.\n\tThe same is true of MRS THEMBISILE MTHEMBU, the widow of the second deceased who has been left a widow with six children, four of whom are still at school.\n\tThere are also the three survivors of the attack, MR R B DUBE, MR AFRICA MBELE AND MR AARON MBELE.  We refer these persons to the R & R Committee for their consideration AS VICTIMS in terms of the relevant provisions of the Act.",
