<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>	Mr Mdluli, is it correct that you were born in 1960 at a place known as Inanda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And are you currently serving a sentence in prison as a result of a conviction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And were you convicted of murder, attempted murder, robbery and you were sentenced to a term of imprisonment, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And how many years did you receive as a result of that conviction and sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> 18 years imprisonment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> I see and do you recall when that was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> In 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Prior to your conviction and sentence is it correct you were residing in the KwaMashu township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> My house is in Inanda in a town Section A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> So you were residing in Inanda, the new town?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Backs to KwaMashu township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And now were you a member of any political party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> I was an ANC supporter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> I see.  You were not a paid up member or you were not a member at all of the ANC, you were merely a supporter, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you were also employed as a member of the KwaZulu Police, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> What rank did you have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> I was a lance sergeant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And for how long had you been a member of the police force before your conviction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> I had been employed for about nine years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Alright.  Now you committed these various offences for which you were convicted.  Can you tell the Members of the Committee what motivated you to commit these offences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> I was stationed at KwaMashu.  There were two conflicting organisations at KwaMashu, that is the ANC dominated in the township and outside KwaMashu there was Lindelani which was dominated by the IFP.  Those IFP members collaborated with the KwaZulu Police when they attacked the ANC members in the township particularly in Section K and in Induzu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> May I just interrupt you a little bit?  If you speak can you take it step by step because there are people interpreting so that they can catch up with you?  Right, carry on from where you ended?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> This killing of ANC by IFP members and sympathisers and the police affected my family, friends and neighbours.  This affected me very deeply and I felt that I had a responsibility to do something to assist.  There were defence units that existed in the areas to protect the communities.  I knew those units and they were responsible for protecting the community, my friends, my family and the people of the section as well as M Section as well as the rest of the KwaMashu township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>	I saw it fit to render assistance and the first thing that I did was to give them ammunition.  After a while we acquired firearms which we used to assist them with although these were later confiscated by the police when we were arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> When you say you were arrested and neighbours were affected, did you have any specific relatives that were killed by Inkatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Now how were your relatives effected there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> They were effected because the section of M would be attacked and that is where I had relatives.  My children would also be effected there as well as my neighbours.  They knew me and I had rendered some assistance to protect that family that housed my children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> This background you are giving it as a motivation for you committing these crimes you are serving in respect of which you are serving a sentence, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> I take it you planned to commit this robbery at Ntwetwe, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> What did you hope to achieve by actually committing this robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> We wanted to acquire firearms so that we would be able to assist different units who were protecting the township.  I have already mentioned that is KwaMashu and Ntuso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> During your planning did you at any stage plan to commit murder or attempted murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> No, that was not planned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Right, I take it that you proceeded from wherever you were on the day of the robbery to Ntwetwe area, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Were you driving any motor vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> We were in two vehicles, a BMW and a Toyota Corolla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Who were driving these motor vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> The BMW was driven by Dunsani Dlamini and the Toyota Corolla was driven by myself on the way to and on the return journey it was driven by James Lucky Hlengwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And the people you have mentioned are the people that were convicted and sentenced together with you by the high court, they were accused number 3 and number 5 in that case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Right, were you armed in any manner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Yes we were armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You personally, how were you armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> I had my service pistol, a 7.65 as well as a 9 mm pistol which belonged to Constable Kamboli.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Alright and did you know where you - well sorry, can I just rephrase it?  Did you discuss ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry Mr Ngubane, let's get a clear picture who was armed with what before you go on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you.  You have described how you were armed and were the other people also armed?  People in your company?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> I had my own firearm as well as Sangoni's firearm.  When we arrived at the scene I handed my firearm to Bheki who was a member of the defence unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Bheki who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Bheki Dlamini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> He was not one of the co-accused when you appeared before the high court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Yes he was not one of the accused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And how were the other members armed, members of your group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> James Lucky Hlengwa had his 9 mm and Ukunuleko was also a member of the self defence unit, he had a 9 mm in his possession, that was his firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Was there anyone in your group who had a firearm known as HMC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Of the people who were at the scene, no one carried a big firearm.  I do not recall correctly which firearm Dumsani Dlamini had although he was not at the scene of the crime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But when he did the planning and after the robbery did anyone of you possess a firearm known as the HMC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> On our way back we left three firearms at KwaMashu K section, there were two HMC's and one shotgun.  Dumsani Dlamini took one HMC to Hammersdale, that would have been used to assist defence units there because there were similar problems prevailing there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Okay, let's go back to the stage now when you were travelling and before you could do that, before you could commit robbery did you target any particular area where you were going to commit robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> What happened was that Dumsani Dlamini came to us and informed us that the opportunity to acquire firearms to assist defence units has presented itself.  He then told us that there was a certain gentleman by the surname of Luthuli, a Constable Luthuli who was stationed at Ntetwe.  This person had come up with a suggestion of robbing a vehicle that would be paying out some monies.  Mr Luthuli was a member of Inkatha but at the time he was our friend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> We then agreed that what we are after is the firearms but we were not going to inform Luthuli about that because he was a member of the opposing organisation and he was stationed at Ntwetwe, he worked with the police there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> So Luthuli suggested to you that you should commit robbery and rob people of money, is that what he told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did he tell you anything about the firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> He informed us of the type of firearms that those people carry and exactly how many there are that escort the PL team.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did he tell you where these firearms are kept?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> As far as we knew the police would have the firearms in their possession.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Okay, then you went to the spot where this robbery was to take place, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct, we did go there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Where was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> It's at Tapuka's Store.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And you arrived there and what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> When we arrived there it was myself, Lucky Hlengwa, Bheki and Gunuleko.  There were four policemen, one was seated in the vehicle and three were outside the shop.  We then instructed them to drop their weapons.  The one that was directly in front of me, I had pressed my firearm against him on his back.  He tried to turn, carrying an HMC, to fight back.  At that precise moment I heard gunfire which I did not know where it came from.  I then shot at that policeman and then took cover behind a van that was parked on the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> The policeman that you shot whereabouts did you shoot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> On the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Do you know who that policeman is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> No I do not have knowledge with regards to his identity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Do you know what happened of him or he was merely injured or he died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> He died on the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But surely in the High Court you must have been told that you had committed murder in respect of a certain person whose name was mentioned, is it not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> I do not remember it being mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Okay, when you say you shot him on his head did you shoot him on his forehead?  Did you shoot him on his forehead or the back of his head or the side of his head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> If I remember correctly it was on the side towards the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> How many times did you shoot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Okay, besides that shot that you fired, did you fire any further shots, you personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Yes, after that I took cover behind a van.  There was then a shoot out that took place between us and the police for quite a while.  At the end two of them fled and one other died on the scene.  In total there were two policemen who died on the scene and two fled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And were those the two people who were killed at the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> What did you remove from the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> We removed all firearms on the scene and we saw a trunk that was in the van.  As far as we knew any truck that is in the possession of the police was used for the storing of firearms and ammunition.  We then assumed that there might be firearms or ammunition inside the trunk so we took the trunk as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Who actually took the trunk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> It was Gululeko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And then what did you do with all the things that you removed at the scene of the robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> We took those firearms and the trunk with to K Section and when we opened the trunk there was nothing except for a slab of zinc.  We then left three firearms with Gululeko at K Section as well as Bheki.  Those two were members of the self defence unit.  One firearm was taken by Dumsani Ernest Dlamini to Hammersdale.  As I've already mentioned, there was also fighting going on there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You say you left the firearms with who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> With Gululeko and Bheki.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you.  When you decided to commit this robbery were you under command of anyone or any political organisation or local defence unit structure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> No one had given us the authority to go fetch those firearms but we were forced by the situation that prevailed, that is we felt we had to render assistance to ANC structures who were unarmed, defenceless and were suffering attacks from armed people such as Inkatha and KwaZulu Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> So you are asking that you be granted amnesty in respect of all the offences that have been convicted of and in respect of which you are serving sentence is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> According to the charge sheet you were charged, that is the indictment, I think it's page 12 to 13, towards the end of page 12, you were charged with murder in that you killed one Samwe Sipho Hlongwane and murder again, that you killed one Ngongo Jerome Kuzwayo and attempted murder and robbery of various people.  The point I'm making to you is that there are definitely families of these people present here and who may not be present but who are aware of your conviction of your sentence.  Do you have any message for them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Yes.  When the incident occurred it was during a time of war.  During that time, the '87, '88, '89, '90, 1991, everyone knows that there was a war going on in all the townships, that is between the ANC and the IFP.  What we did then, that is to fetch those firearms, even though it added up resulting in the death of their loved ones, that was not our intention.  We wanted to help families who died day in, day out being killed by people who were armed and trained as well as the IFP which was armed as well.  Therefore I will say to those relatives please understand the situation that prevailed at the time.  We are now faced with a different situation where we reconciled with regards to past conflict.  I will then ask that maybe what took place, before then, before the present government, led us where we are today so I would ask them to please forgive and forget the past and let us look towards the future.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you, that is the evidence.</p>

<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Ngubane.  Mr Mapoma, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Just a few, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>	Mr Mdluli, you were a member of the KwaZulu Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And in fact in KwaZulu during that time you will agree with me KwaZulu Government was led by the Inkatha Freedom Party, isn't it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And the KwaZulu Police themselves had allegiance to the Inkatha Freedom Party, generally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Generally the KwaZulu Police were aligned to the IFP but it was not everyone but yes, most of them did support the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And in fact your friend who was an Inkatha member, what's his name now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Constable Luthuli.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, he was an Inkatha member and worked closely with Inkatha and the police, KwaZulu Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> We knew him to be a member or a supporter of the IFP but we had never seen him committing acts on behalf of Inkatha or for instance killing, murdering people on behalf of Inkatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I see.  Now you yourself, were you not a supporter of Inkatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Throughout my service at the police station or even before I've never been a supporter of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Before you became a policeman were you supporting any political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Yes I supported the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, so when did you join the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> In 1981 I joined the South African Police then and in 1984 I wanted to work in the department of the finger printing unit.  I then made a request to be moved there but because of discrimination then I was not accepted.  I then heard of the KwaZulu Police where I met somebody who was in charge of the finger printing department.  That person then requested me to go work in his section.  I was then made to fill in a pro-forma form which released me into the KwaZulu Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And in 1981 the ANC was a banned organisation and in fact it was known by the police force then as an organisation of the terrorists, you are aware of that, aren't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Yes I'm aware of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yet that was the organisation you were supporting when you went to join the police, that's what you want to tell this Committee now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> I will explain that.  When I joined the police it was after my schooling at Gugulabasha.  That school is in Dusoma, very close to KwaMashu.  I and other pupils from that school and neighbouring school we supported the UDF at the time which I think was a branch of the ANC.  When I joined the police in 1991 you made to take an oath and you were informed that if you are a police officer you should be apolitical so that you are able to protect the community fairly.  That is what was on my mind when I went to college and when I returned from the college that was also on my mind.  When I was with the KwaZulu Police in 1984 I arrived there in April.  I was told then that when you joined the KwaZulu Police you should become a member of the IFP and also that the police force is under the command of Mangosutho Buthelezi who was the Minister of Police and an IFP Chairperson there.  I then attempted to make an application to return to the SAP because that was against my policies.  That application was turned down in Ulundi.  I went to the police commissioner at C R Swart to explain my problems.  He said he would accept me provided Ulundi gives me permission to do so.  When I returned to Ulundi they refused, they said I cannot go back to the South African Police.  I then decided that I shall continue working then and then I had an idea that my colleagues were members of an organisation that I opposed therefore I felt it was time for me to do whatever I could to support that organisation which I supported and that which was supported by my family and my friends and neighbours.  Therefore I continued being an ANC supporter although I was working in an environment which was dominated by the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So you're saying you started being a KwaZulu Police in 1984?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Okay, it is in 1984 when you were told that if you are KwaZulu Police you're supposed to support Inkatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Okay.  Now on this day when you planned this robbery what were you intending to rob actually?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> We wanted to acquire firearms for the reason I stated previously that is to assist defence units who protected our families, our friends in the township who were under attack from the IFP from Lindelani and Richmond Farm and they would do this with the assistance and collusion of the KwaZulu Police, such police whom I knew.  Sometimes things would happen even in front of me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> During your service as a policeman, nine years service, I suppose you knew where the storeroom with the service firearms was, is it not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> That is correct, I did know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And it has never been your plan to rob the firearms from the storeroom of the police service weapons, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> After nine years of service in the police I had knowledge of how well guarded those firearms were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> No, no, Mr Mdluli, just answer my question.  My question is very clear and it just needs a very simple answer.  I am asking you when you were planning to rob firearms, it never came to your plans that you had to go and rob from the storeroom.  I just want yes or no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Okay.  And what was happening at that shop where you went to rob?  What was actually happening there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> It was a pension payout point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And you were aware that was what was going on there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Yes I knew very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And you were aware that the van which keeps money is escorted by police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Yes I knew that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I see and you were aware when you took the trunk that that is the trunk which is supposed to be carrying money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> No, we knew that the money was kept in briefcases.  In all police stations trunks are used to store firearms or ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I see.  You know of no trunk which was used to carry money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> No trunk is used to store money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I see.  I see.  Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Mapoma.  Has the Panel got any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Yes.  Tell me, the people responsible for paying out pension monies, where were they when they came back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> When we arrived those people were inside the shop where we didn't even go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How did it go about before this incident, how exactly did you go about supporting the ANC as you've said you were a supporter of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> I explained before that I supported the ANC since my childhood until I joined the police service.  When I was in the KwaZulu Police I became firm in my support in the ANC to render assistance to my community, my family and friends who were under attack and being killed by the IFP and KwaZulu Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Tell me did you deliberate with anybody in the ANC about this robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Yes Ugunulego was an ANC person who worked with the different units and they protected the community of peace action and Bheki who arrived later also was part of the discussions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Did you know the ANC chairman of the branch of the ANC in that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> No I did not know the chairman, the people I had contact with were in the lower structures of the ANC, that is the foot soldiers who protected the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry Chair.  By launching this attack at this particular place where you did were you not putting the lives of pensioners in danger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Our plan was to direct ourselves at the police who were as well trained as we were.  We knew that if you point a firearm at a trained police officer it is difficult for that person to fight back.  Nonetheless we were surprised to encounter police officers who were prepared to fight back and we were then forced to shoot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> That police officer you shot on the head, why did you shoot him on the head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> I shot him at the side of his head that is above the ear if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Why did you do that, was it your intention to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> The intention was not to kill him but what caused all that was that when I pointed my firearm at him and instructed him to put down his weapon he fought back, he tried to turn around and he had a HFC in his possession.  Also I heard a gun going off and I was not sure who was firing so to be safe I felt that I should at that person who was directly in front of me because he was also fighting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> If you had found money in that truck would you have taken it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> Unfortunately when we did attempt to open the trunk on the scene but it was locked so it could not open.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>We then assumed that there must be firearms or ammunition in the trunk.  We only managed to open it at K Section and we only found a zinc slab inside.  Our intention was to remove firearms not money.  If we had an intention of robbing cash we would not have gone to the last pay point.  Secondly, we knew very well that the people who were paying out the pensions were inside the shop and after we had shot and everybody had been killed it would not have been difficult to go inside the shop and remove that cash but we only removed the firearms and we left the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> But that does not answer the question.  What would have been your attitude if you found money in the trunk?  I know you didn't find any money in the trunk, what would you have done with the money if you found it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> If we could have opened it on the scene and discovered money inside we would have left it there because that was not our intention.  Our objective was to acquire those firearms to assist our community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> These people you have mentioned, Gululeko and Bheki, where are they now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> The police could not trace Gululeko.  We heard that he had skipped the country.  I do not know about Bheki because he has never been arrested ever since.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You've not heard anything of Bheki, you've made no contact with the two whatsoever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> We never had contact but we would contact his younger brother.  On our last contact he informed us that Gululeko has not returned up to this date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How long after this incident were you arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULI:</span> After a week, on the 29th March.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> I've no re-examination thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Mdluli, you're excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> That closes the case for the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ngubane, any submissions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE IN ARGUMENT:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  My only submission is that the evidence by the applicant is enough either to advance or negate his case.  I cannot improvise on what he has said.  That is all I wish to submit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Mapoma, have you got any submissions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA IN ARGUMENT:</span> Chairperson, my short route will be that as it is from the evidence it is quite inconceivable that the KwaZulu Police could have been supporters of the ANC during that time.  In fact the applicant has not tendered a</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>convincing or satisfactory explanation as to how this irony occurred that he could be a member of KwaZulu Police and yet be a supporter of the ANC at that time and it is quite strange indeed as well for them to turn to rob weapons at a pay point and in fact rob a container which is supposed to be a container of money yet all the time the intention is to rob weapons and unfortunately some people died there and it is my submission that there has not been any explanation which makes the killing of those persons a politically motivated act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>	Without dwelling much, Chairperson, I would say the application ought to be refused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Mapoma.  Is there anything else that you wanted to add Mr Ngubane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> No Mr Chairperson, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, the Panel will take time to consider this matter and will formulate a decision as soon as the circumstances permit for that to be done whereupon the decision will be made available to the parties with an interest in this matter.  Under the circumstances the decision of the Panel is reserved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>	Mr Ngubane, we thank you for your assistance in this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you very much Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma, we've got one more matter left on the roll.  What is the arrangement with Mr Panday in regard to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> He is present, Chairperson and also Mr Maseko is present.  The applicant and the victims, they're all here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They're present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Perhaps we should take a short luncheon adjournment and try and start with this matter as soon as circumstances permit.  We will take the luncheon adjournment at this stage but we will only adjourn for thirty minutes whereafter we will deal with the matter of Mkhize.  So we will reconvene here in 30 minutes time.  We're adjourned.</p>
