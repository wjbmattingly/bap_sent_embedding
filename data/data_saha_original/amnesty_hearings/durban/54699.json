I told him yes, I knew those boys and he also asked me if I can go with the police to point out to the houses where the boys were staying and  I said yes, I can do that. \n\tAnd then I stayed at his house because he told me to stay there.  I stayed with  Vuzi Mbete and Mr Djamile came to us, he had three balaclavas and three overalls and he an ammunition inside a Standard Bank plastic bag.  He gave me torch and he gave Vuzi and this other boy bullets and then he told me that we should go and I must point out the houses belonging to these boys who swore at him the other day.\n\tAs we were going there we used shortcuts and as we approached the river - it was dark - we started wearing our balaclavas and our overalls.  We went straight to the boys' house who were UDF as well and at that place, they call it Magogokweni and it is built by a corrugated sink.  We started knocking - they told me to kick the door, I did so and then we went inside the house, the three of us.  \n\tThey started shooting.  They boys were sleeping and they started shooting at them.  As they were shooting, I heard one of them crying, screaming asking why, what's going on, what have we done and I could recognise the voice that belonged to Begelita.\n\tAfter that it was silent, the screaming went off and then we started running back to Mr Djamile's house.  At Mr Djamile's house we were asked by him as to how we went.  We told him the operation went very well.  And then he gave us muti to wash ourselves with and to drink as well and then he told me to go back home.  I went home and the next day he sent my father to call me again.\n\tI went to Mr Djamile and he told me to go back to were we shot as to try and find out what was going on after the previous night's shooting.  As I arrived there, there was blood all over the place and I learnt that those boys whom we shot at were not dead, we actually shot at their feet so they survived.  \n\tI went back to Mr Djamile, I told him, he looked unhappy and told me to go and call Vela and Vuzi and he asked them as to what happened, he sent them to kill those UDF members but now they've survived.

And then he asked me if I can go to Mr Mkhize to kill him and then I said to him yes, I can do that and then he said okay.\n\tI told him that I will wait for him to tell me as to when exactly to go and kill Mr Mkhize.

He also asked me if I knew if Mr Mkhize carried a gun or not and I said I think he's got a gun because he's a taxi man.\n\tAfter that incident Mr Dalikolo came to Mr Djamile's house again.

When I arrived at Mr Djamile I found a car parked outside - a Cressida - and Mr Djamile was there.  There were people inside the car and the doors were opened and as I arrived there Mr Djamile told me to go with the boys to show them Mrs Shabalala's house.\n\tThese boys who were inside the car were busy polishing their guns.  It was Dalikolo, Socha and I didn't know these other three people.  We went, we took a ...(inaudible) drive.  When we arrived next to a garage the other four people went out, in fact they got out of the car and they started walking.  \tMe and Maslanduna were the only two left inside the house.  I saw them walking very slow.  We drove next to a school, we parked there and Maslanduna told me not to lock the doors and I saw Mrs Shabalala's car leaving the bottle store and these other boys whom we dropped they started shooting.  They shot at her car and she accelerated and then they came running and one of them didn't come back to get inside the car.  \n\tWe drove back to Claremont.  We drove passed the graveyard and we passed a bottle store belonging to Mr Nklega and then Maslanduna drove back to try and find this other guy whom we didn't take because he didn't know Claremont very well.  \n\tWhen we arrived at Mr Djamile's house he took us behind the house and he asked us as to how we went and this other guy told him that - we missed her.  He got angry, he shouted who we missed her, how can we do that and then he told me to go home and sleep.\n\tThe next day Mr Djamile called me again and he sent me to Mrs Shabalala's bottle store and check the damage we caused at her car but I was scared to go alone, I asked a friend of mine whom I didn't tell him as to why.  I went there and I looked at Mrs Shabalala's car,  I checked on it and I went to Mr Djamile to report.",

Djamile sent Delisile to my place and Delisile is Djamile's maid and they asked Delisile to call me.  I went to Djamile's place and when I got to Djamile's place he called me into his house which was just below the office which was within the premises.\n\tWhen I got into that office, I saw some policemen, two White policemen who had some walkie talkies as well as guns and two other males who were unknown to me.  Msizi was present during that day and he told me that he had worked with Msizi for a long time and he wanted me to also join so that we could be one thing and be united.  \n\tHe further said that he could see that I was scared.  He wanted me to take my ID and we could meet at Pinetown police station and I would get the two policemen, that is the White policemen, as well as the two other males.  I did not do that.  When I got out of the house - I was going up the stairs - I told Msizi that I wasn't going to do that, why doesn't he use his own children, why does he want to use us.\n\tI was not going to do that, I was not going to collaborate with him in whatever he wanted us to do.  These policemen were driving a blue XR6, they waited for until 2 o'clock and I think Msizi went back to report that I did not want to collaborate with them.\n\tAt about 1 a.m. during the night I was having a fight with Msizi and I saw some guys at night who were wearing coats and whilst we were having an argument they took out their guns and they said that I should take them to Djamile's place and I should not look back.  \n\tWe went to Djamile's place and when I got into his yard, Djamile saw me and asked as to whether they got me.  It was very apparent to me that I was the one they wanted and they said, yes they got me.  There was a woman who was Djamile's wife, Mama Zibugo.  Mama Zibugo said it's good that you did get hold of this dog, bring him in.  \n\tWhen we got into the house he said, Msizi we are going now, you are going to get into the front of the car and the rest are going to sit at the back and you're going to take Maqnoba and put him inside the boot.\n\tThat's when it became apparent that I was going to be killed and I asked myself as to how I was going to fit inside the boot because I'm fairly tall.  I tried to remain calm and we went.  Mr Djamile's house is surrounded by a forest, I just ran into the forest and they shot after me but I managed to get right deep into the forest and I went to my other relatives.",

She did not hear anything that number one accused said - number one accused being the applicant here said - but she confirms that others went around when she took Mrs Mkhize to the front of the court.
