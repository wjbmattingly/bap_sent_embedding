You will recall Mr Chairman that yesterday we were at great pains to argue before you in the public interest that you not make an order that the identity of informers be disclosed and Mr Chairman, of course, you did not make such an order, in fact your decision in that regard has been postponed pending the outcome of an interim agreement which was reached for practical purposes in order to attempt to solve the problem which would prevent you from having to make such an order.  \n\tThis morning, Mr Chairman, we could not help noticing on television that the SABC sent into South Africa new supports which all but stated that the Committee had made such an order but which left no doubt in the minds of anyone listening and seeing that programme that there is now an order that the identity of informers be disclosed.  \n\tMr Chairman, we attempted to make it quite clear yesterday that no police force in the world can work and do their work properly, solve crime, without the assistance of informers and how anxious informers are concerning their own safety.  It seems to us, Mr Chairman, apart from the fact that what the SABC did this morning appears to be precisely what the Act has in mind in Section 39(a) in anticipating an order but also, Mr Chairman, it has really made the whole proceeding of yesterday ludicrous because what we try to prevent has now been expounded by the SABC over the country.  \n\tWe believe, Mr Chairman, that in fairness to the public, the SABC ought to make quite sure that the public is informed that they have made a mistake and that no such order was issued by this Committee.  We just wanted to place that on record, Mr Chairman.",

Before we do that though, there is something I wish to say now that we have finished the hearing and which I will probably forget to say tomorrow, that I am obliged to those who have prepared the bundles, they have put as much information before us as possible and I would also like my thanks to be communicated to the gentlemen who performed the post-mortems and put up the post-mortem reports.  They are certainly more detailed than those I have had to deal with in most criminal cases and they have taken a lot of trouble over it and I think they should be thanked for what they have done.",
