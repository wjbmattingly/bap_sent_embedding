Unfortunately Judge Mall was taken ill yesterday and is in hospital at the present time.  We are uncertain as to how long he will be there, but obviously it will be for some time and in the circumstances I was requested to take over the hearing.  I have discussed the matter with the legal representatives of the applicants and the victims and we have agreed that we can continue with the hearing, with the hearing of evidence but that arrangements will be made to obtain a transcript of the evidence that has been led up to now and of course a recording will be made of the evidence and a transcript obtained from now onwards.  If Judge Mall recovers rapidly, which I trust he will, and is able to rejoin us, we will then have a Committee of four with a complete record of all the proceedings available to us.  If he is unable to join us we will then proceed with the present Committee of three and the reason for the transcript and the delay in addresses is that you will all be able to refer me and the other members of the Committee to any points you wish to make in regard to the evidence that has already been led. As I say, I have discussed this matter with the legal advisers concerned and as I understand it they are all in agreement with this procedure.",

            "Mr Chairman, may it please you. You, having come into the matter fresh, it might be helpful if you were told some of the background to the application and I'm now referring to the Ndaba and Shabalala incident so as to be able to follow better perhaps the evidence as it unfolds before you.\n\tMr Chairman, you are acquainted with a document which since the 5th of February, we have been handing in to the Amnesty Committees.  It's a document under the heading  General Background to Amnesty Applications.  In the applications in which we have appeared, fortunately Mr Chairman we have appeared before you after the 5th of February and you are therefore conversant with that document and no more has to be said about that,\tMr Chairman, also, we are fortunate in this sense that in November of last year, you yourself headed a Committee who heard some of the incidents which took place in Natal and there is a record of that evidence and I specifically refer to the evidence of Col Botha.  You will recall that he gave evidence for some three days before you on the violence in Natal which included Operation Butterfly and Operation Vula, Mr Chairman.  The pages, Mr Chairman, in that record run from page 516 to 611 and that is just the background, Mr Chairman. \n\tWhat we have done in order to be of assistance to the present Committee which was under the Chairmanship of Justice Mall, was to hand 2 further documents to this Committee.  These you perhaps have not seen yet.  The one was handed in as Exhibit B and Chairperson, what this comprises, is simply an extract from the book of Gen Stadler, The Other Side of the Story, where he deals with Operation Vula, the reason for that being that in Ndaba and Shabalala's incident it really concerns Operation Vula.  Apart from that Mr Chairperson, we also handed up an Exhibit C.  Now this exhibit would probably not be new to you because this was a document handed to us in November when last we appeared before you here in this hall, by Ms Gail Wannenburg and it also concerns Operation Vula and that is also before you, Mr Chairperson.\n\tNow without much further ado, what has happened in the meantime since this hearing has commenced, was that we have handed up statements of evidence of the witnesses as we have progressed thus far, the first witness having been Col Botha and that is Exhibit D, Mr Chairman and I will address you on that in a moment.  After Mr Botha, Gen Steyn has given his evidence and he is yet to be cross-examined.  Mr Chairman, with your leave, the facts that unfolded before the Committee from the evidence of Col Botha are these.\n\tHe says that in 1988 he was the Head of the Intelligence Section of the Terrorist Unit of the Security Branch of Port Natal.  Col Andy Taylor was the head of a different unit within the Terrorist Unit in that he handled the askaris and his function was the identification and arrest and interrogation of terrorists with the help of Askaris.  Mr Chairman, apparently during the year 1990 there were something like 9 askaris under Col Taylor and Col Taylor accommodated them at a farm that you'll hear about at Camperdown, Chairperson, where they were - you know about that.\n\tNow Mr Chairman, the story begins in 1988 when Botha says he approached Mr Ndaba in Swaziland, who was then fairly high up in the hierarchy of MK, in order to recruit him as an informer of the Security Branch, which he succeeded in, according to his evidence.  Mr Chairman you will recall that evidence was given before you in November of some changes that took place in the top structure of MK in Swaziland and these were, very briefly Mr Chairman, that Mr Tami Zulu was recalled from Swaziland.  I must say Mr Tami Zulu who was the head of the or the Commander of MK Natal machinery in Swaziland, was recalled in 1988 to Lusaka in Zambia.  As a result of that Mr Chairman, Mr Ndaba who had been second in command at that time, became the Deputy Commander of the MK Natal machinery in Swaziland.\n\tBotha gave evidence, Mr Chairman that when this happened and Ndaba being his informer, he became apprehensive that Ndaba might be targeted by the Security Forces or the Intelligence components in the Republic of South Africa.  He says and explains that to mean that whenever a person became the Commander, he automatically was placed on a target list by ...(indistinct).  Having become thus apprehensive, he spoke to Ndaba and suggested to him that he should try to manipulate it that he be recalled to Zambia, which apparently happened, Mr Chairman.  We don't know how but in fact Mr Ndaba was called to Zambia and someone else took over from him.\n\tMr Chairman on the 7th of July 1990 Mr Ndaba was arrested.  Botha told us that approximately 4 to 6 weeks prior to the 7th of July, Mr Ndaba made contact with him, that was with Botha.  It then appeared that he was in the country.  Botha was told that Ndaba had infiltrated the RSA during the beginning of the year, January or February of 1990 and Ndaba gave him certain information.  Over the period of the 4 to 6 weeks, Botha recalls that he saw Ndaba on two or three occasions during which information was received from Mr Ndaba.  What that information was is not really relevant at this stage, but is relevant Chairperson, is that Mr Ndaba referred to a project, to which he referred to as the President's Committee and it was clear that it involved infiltration of highly placed ANC leaders into the country.  It involved the setting up of safe-houses, it involved the importation of armaments of war and it involved the setting up of structures for purposes of a hands-on command situation.  Am I going too fast Mr Chairman?  And most importantly a sophisticated communications network with computers and a radio, telephone etc. etc.\n\tIf, Mr Chairman, you would have regard to Exhibit C, the second page, the third paragraph, you will see a fairly accurate summary of what I am attempting to tell you.  It says:\n\"The major objectives of Operation Vula were to relocate senior and middle level leaders from the ANC external leadership into South Africa, to create a nation-wide underground network to co-ordinate and support a general insurrection against the apartheid state and to penetrate the South African governmental and security structures for the purposes of intelligence collection and covert disruption.\n\t\tThat for Vula to succeed, it had to create an underground organisation far more sophisticated, secure and secretive than the ANC and it's military wing, Umkhonto weSizwe had been able to achieve to that point in the arms struggle.  In addition it had to create or obtain a secure means of real time communication between the external leadership at the ANC Headquarters in Lusaka, in Zambia and the Vula Operational Command inside - I'm sorry, I repeat - in Zambia and the Vula Operational command inside the country.  It's existing communications system with internal underground operatives consisted of an operation of one time inscription pads, air flight couriers, cross-border smuggling messages etc.\"\t\n\tNow Mr Chairman enough said about that.  That is basically in our submission all you have to know to place you against the background of what was to transpire later.  I might just add, Mr Chairman, that during the course of time, prior to the 7th of July, Mr Ndaba had told Botha of certain persons that had already been thus infiltrated into the RSA.  They consisted of Mr Kasrils, Mr Maharaj and Mr Slovo and as well as others of which he mentioned Mr Gordhan, Mr Patel, Dipak Patel and his evidence was clearly Mr Shabalala as well.  There's no dispute about the fact that Mr Shabalala and Mr Ndaba were working together in the same unit under the auspices of what later became known as Operation Vula, Mr Chairman.  Now all of what I've told you thus far is briefly summarised in Exhibit D, the evidence of Mr Botha. \tNow Mr Chairman, Botha gave evidence to say that on the 7th of July, that was a Saturday, he was telephoned by Maj du Preez and he was informed that a high-ranking terrorist had been arrested and was held at C R Swart Square.  It is common cause among the applicants that du Preez also telephoned Col Taylor, I'm sorry not Col Taylor, terribly sorry, phoned Wasserman and van der Westhuizen as well as Col Botha.  All of these persons then went to C R Swart Square where of course they found Ndaba.  At the time Col Taylor was present and it is perhaps relevant to note, Mr Chairman, that Mr Ndaba had been arrested by an askari, Mr Vusi Ninela.  It later appeared that another askari was also involved in the arrest, but nothing much turns on that.  The fact of the matter is Ninela and/or one or more of the other askaris arrested Mr Ndaba.\n\tAt C R Swart Square, Col Botha then took the other members, Taylor, Wasserman, du Preez and van der Westhuizen into another office and then explained to them that Ndaba couldn't be held because he was his informer.  We know from the evidence of Gen Steyn, that Steyn and Botha were the two people who were aware of the status of Mr Ndaba as an informer and nobody else.  When Botha intimated this news to the others, Col Taylor got upset and he and Ninela, who was also present, withdrew.  Botha then instructed du Preez, Wasserman and van der Westhuizen to take Mr Ndaba to a safe-house which they used, which was situated at Verulam.  The reason and the purpose of that was that, first of all to lie low for a while and secondly to work out a \"dekstorie\" in case the ANC got wind of the fact that Mr Ndaba had been arrested.  All of this happened during the late morning of Saturday the 7th of July 1990.\n\tMr Chairman, soon after arriving at Verulam, are you looking in Exhibit D to find where I am now, Mr Chairman?  It's at paragraph 22.",

            "Oh, I'm not sure I know which one you're talking about Mr Chairman.  But however that may be, soon after their arrival there or on their way there, Botha is informed by Ndaba that he has a prior arrangement to meet Mr Shabalala and he tells them where this meeting was to take place, near the Greyville racecourse.  Ndaba and Botha then consider whether Ndaba should attend the meeting or not and the decision is taken that he should.  Ndaba then, sorry, Botha then assures Ndaba that the members of the Security Branch will be in close attendance in case there may be any danger to Ndaba because of the fact that he had been arrested that morning and they agree on a special signal which Ndaba would give if he felt threatened.  A long story cut short, Mr Chairman, they arrived at the appointed place.  du Preez, Wasserman were in a car with which they went there and they observed a blue Toyota Corolla with which Mr Shabalala had arrived and into which Mr Ndaba had gotten with Botha and van der Westhuizen on foot somewhere in the vicinity.  At some stage Ndaba gives the signal and immediately they approach the vehicle and Shabalala is \"arrested\".  They are then both transferred back to Verulam, Mr Chairman, where they are held in separate rooms and now the following facts appear to emerge.\n\tNdaba is now very uncertain about his position.  The Security Branch now has Shabalala in their custody where they had no intention of arresting him in the first place.  During the course of the weekend, Mr Shabalala makes it clear to the members that he suspects Mr Ndaba of being a police informer.  The immediate result of that is that Mr Shabalala can now not be released because the intention is that Mr Ndaba should be released, where he could continue with his work in Operation Vula and give feedback to Mr Botha.\n\tMr Chairman, during this weekend there is a debriefing of Mr Ndaba by Botha and according to Botha's evidence, for the first time that weekend he realised the complexity and the importance of the Operation Vula operation, so much so Mr Chairman, that he reports to Gen Steyn and on that Monday the 10th Botha and Steyn go up to Pretoria to Headquarters to inform Headquarters of how they now see Operation Vula.  They stay there and it's not clear whether they stay till the Tuesday or to the Wednesday the 11th or the 12th, but now much turns on that Mr Chairman, but what is clear is that instructions go out from Gen van der Merwe that all the intelligence agencies in the country be informed as well as overseas embassies, because, at the time as you will recall Mr Chairman, there were serious negotiations about negotiations going on and there was serious talk about the cessation of the arms struggle and people were talking about getting together to solve the conflict of the country by negotiation.  It was foreseen that if arrests took place of such high officials as the ones that we have mentioned to you earlier, it would have a dramatic effect on the negotiation process.\n\tThey came back Mr Chairman and then what happens is, on Wednesday the 12th, while Wasserman and du Preez are keeping observation, Mr Siphiwe Nyanda realises that an observation is being kept on him and he attempts to escape.  He then becomes arrested.  Mr Chairman this arrest now triggers a number of arrests so that between 12 and 15 to the best of the recollection of Botha, people of Operation Vula are arrested during the course of the day, apparently according to the cross-examination until late that night on the 12th of July.\t\n\tBotha and Steyn go back to Pretoria on the Thursday the 13th, I'm sorry, Thursday the 12th to report, or it might have been the 13th Mr Chairman, I'm not sure but they go back to Pretoria to report the new development and to await orders.  In the meantime what has happened, according to Botha, is this.  He, that is Botha, reported back to Ndaba what was transpiring and when Ndaba heard that arrests had been made, he became very anxious.  What apparently happened on Friday the 13th Mr Chairman or Thursday the 12th, I'm not certain, was that it was decided in Pretoria that a National Investigation Unit be set up to investigate the whole issue around Operation Vula and during the course of their visit to Pretoria which took a day or two, they were told, Mr Chairman, there will be no prosecutions of any of the people who had become arrested.\nBotha says that when he came back to Durban he went and he told Ndaba that there won't be arrests and this apparently upset Ndaba terribly.",

            "MR VISSER",
            "There wouldn't be prosecutions of the people that had been arrested or will still be arrested.  Sorry, thank you, Chairperson.  Now, up to this stage the problem with Shabalala, you will recall, was that he might endanger the position of Ndaba.  Now suddenly Ndaba himself has become a problem, because Ndaba then told Botha and the others apparently that he thinks it better for himself to go and take his chances with the ANC, to make a clean breast of it in the hope that he would be forgiven, rather than to stay on with the Security Branch as an informer.\n\tMr Chairman, when this happened, Botha considered the circumstances and he went and discussed it with Steyn and they said to each other that under those circumstances unless Mr Ndaba is brought to a different insight, he can't be released.  Steyn tells Botha to go back and to see to it if he can, to get Ndaba \"se kop reg\", he must get his head straight.  Botha went back to Verulam and according to him attempts were made, serious attempts were made, but Ndaba had become very morbid and very worried and he stuck to his guns that he would rather go and talk to the ANC and see whether he could obtain remission from them.\n\tBotha then decided that in the circumstances he had no option but to eliminate Ndaba because he couldn't release him, he certainly couldn't charge him of anything and thus his fate was sealed.  The situation then, Mr Chairman, as far as Mr Shabalala was concerned, changed slightly because where previously he was kept and could not be released in order to protect Ndaba, Ndaba himself was now going to be eliminated and Botha explained to the Committee that what his considerations were in regard to Mr Ndaba and these were the following.  He said that in that time when negotiations were under way and where they had strict instructions to do nothing which would jeopardise the position of the National Party at the negotiation table, he was afraid that if Shabalala was released, he would tell the world that he was abducted, he was held against his will, that is unlawfully, and the probabilities were that he might have put two and two together that Ndaba was eliminated and he might have made that inference of his public and the mere publication of such matters was a thought too horrible to contemplate because that would have jeopardised precisely the South African Government and the National Party where that was the one thing which they were ordered and instructed to avoid.\n\tThen Mr Chairman, having decided that, the night of the 14th/15th of July, Mr Ndaba and Mr Shabalala were taken to the Tugela Mouth, where they were both killed execution style by Botha, Wasserman, du Preez and van der Westhuizen.  Those members then went back, took the car of Mr Shabalala, that is the blue Toyota Corolla, drove it out on the Ndwandwe Road to a place which could not be identified later, although attempts were made, it was there sprinkled with petrol and set alight and burned out.  Now Mr Chairman, as brief as I could, that is the background and I hope that I haven't slanted any of the facts, but if I have my learned friend will certainly tell you about that and after that Gen Steyn has given evidence and his evidence was as you can imagine, simply confined to those areas were he personally had knowledge and that is, he visited Pretoria with Botha on two occasions and he himself went to Pretoria on three occasions, the last being without being accompanied by Botha and the evidence of Botha as to what was discussed between them, was confirmed by Gen Steyn and presently he is awaiting to be cross-examined, Mr Chairman.  I may just point this out Mr Chairman, in cross-examination two issues on the facts were placed in dispute.  The one is whether Mr Ndaba was in fact an informer and secondly, Mr  Chairman, it was suggested that the reason why Mr Ndaba and Mr Shabalala had to be killed was because they had been tortured to such an extent that they could not be released.  Those were, as far as we are concerned, the two main disputes which arose from the cross-examination on the facts, Mr Chairperson.\n\tPerhaps my learned friend would like to, well my learned friends would like to address you on something which I might have left out?",

            "Yes, thank you Mr Chairperson.  Basically Mr Visser has given the evidence from his client's perspective.  I submit that much of what he says is contested by ourselves.  I don't think it would be appropriate for me to go through every aspect of what is contested.  I am alive to the fact that you're going to be referring to the transcripts of the proceedings and much will come to your attention therein, but there are certain things that I think are important for me to highlight.  \tFirst is that it is clear that our position is that we dispute that Ndaba was an informer.  We submit that Ndaba was arrested on the 7th, he was tortured to release names, it was then that Vula, that the planning around Vula became known to the Security Police.  They then decided to go up to Pretoria and take further instruction.  They got specific orders from Gen van der Merwe and this is common cause that further arrests should be delayed until the week commencing the 16th of July.  These orders were not adhered to.  The - our version is that they were deliberately not adhered to through reasons of personal ill will and malice towards those who'd been arrested.  The version for the applicants is that, as given by Mr Visser, that circumstances concerning Gen Nyanda were such that he was alive to the fact that he was being followed and hence was likely to escape unless they acted.  We dispute that.  Our version is that further, sorry, as a result of the evidence that was given, it's common cause that it was in the knowledge of both Col Botha and Gen Steyn that prosecutions would not proceed and that as a result of the fact that these people were already held, they acted and killed these people in the full knowledge that prosecutions wouldn't proceed.\n\tThere is a certain amount of dispute about the way the executions occurred.

I joined the Revolutionary Council which was charged with prosecuting the military political struggle within South Africa.  I then became elected member of the National Executive of the ANC and when the Political Military Council was appointed, I was member of the Political Military Council.  \n\tIn the course of that work as the secretary of the ANC underground, I was selected by Pres Tambo to lead Operation Vula.

The screening had to be thorough.  It was not just the technical training that was involved.

After that training and before the training he was in the military camps in Angola, military camps of the ANC.  He served in those structures.  He was then moved to the neighbouring country, Mozambique and Swaziland and he functioned in Swaziland when conditions were extremely tense and dangerous.  The Umkomati Accord had been signed and as is now known it was preceded by a secret accord between Swaziland and Pretoria, which gave a free hand to the South African Security Forces to operate in Swaziland.  Numerous cadres had been bombed, had been shot. one of those included the one-time secretary of the Revolutionary Council, Cassius Maake.  I had operated in Swaziland myself, clandestinely, at one stage continuously for 6 months in 1982, so conditions were extremely dangerous.  You were in constant danger of being ambushed or kidnapped but Charles was working in a structure which was directly charged with prosecuting the military struggle in Natal.  He rose to be Commander of the Natal Machinery in 1988 and because of conditions in Swaziland where people used to get arrested and be deported, he was subsequently deported in 1988 to Zambia.  It is true that at that time there was some concern about the reliability of some of the members of the ANC structures and of Umkhonto weSizwe operating in Swaziland, so any withdrawals would go through a further screening in Zambia and his name came forward in that context.

The deportation of Charles took place in the context of a number of arrests that were ongoing and as each person was arrested, Swaziland authorities would arrange to deport the person.  As an ANC member in this particular period, the deportation could only be to Zambia, Tanzania or Angola.  Mozambique was excluded.  But I have a report here, Chairperson, from within the Security Branch, dated 31-08-1988.  It says there, it is a routine Pretoria  Security monitoring and it says there under Clause 2 (c), 2 9(4) that Z C Ndaba, MK Charles, has been deported to Lusaka.  Its in the context of other deportations and other people leaving Swaziland.  It has been passed on within the Security Branch for the attention of Maj Taylor, it is also countersigned by Capt Botha and there are various other signatures and I have copies of that available for the Committee.  I would also like to draw your attention that during that period of 1988, Charles Ndaba was the subject of intense interest by the South African Security Police.

            "1988, two operations were carried out by Pretoria's agents in Swaziland, one of them was an ambush of a vehicle and Pretoria were looking for Charles Ndaba.  That information is confirmed in de Kock's evidence given at the TRC Amnesty Committee about three weeks ago.  There is also another report from within the Security Branch and this is relevant to the numbering system and it is relevant to Capt Botha.  The first is a report submitted within the Security Branch structures by Sgt Wasserman and Capt H J P Botha and he's described there as the \"Verslag skrywer\", the report writer.  It is dated the 14th of February 1988.  It is based on an agent's report who had gone to Swaziland and the agent's number is given as PN664 and in that report the agent says that he met a person called MK Zandile in Swaziland, paragraph 28.  MK Zandile, Charles Zandile is then identified by means of a photograph as Charles Ndaba and the reference for Charles Zakhele Ndaba, otherwise known as MK Zandile is given as S4/52573.  That I have reason to believe is a simple file reference of people they are monitoring, not a reference to an agent because the agents are PN.  What is interesting about that report Chairperson is that after that lengthy report, at its end, is a distribution list of information but before the distribution list on paragraph 41, all names that this agent had visited in Swaziland, are summarised.  It says then\n\"The peoples recognised are Buthelezi Gatsha\"\nand then it has an \"Afdeling\" reference number for him with a PNV number, then Headquarters reference number.  Then it has two names \"Jabo and Lucky\".  Against them the Security Branch say, \"Of no security importance\".  That is the way they covered a potential or active agent.  Then they came to Charles Ndaba.  They give his full details, they have no PN reference for him, and they give that file number.  They then have later down the name Mr Zondi.  Against him they say \"Not of security importance\".  That is the way they protected their agents, so that the rest of the structure would not take interest.  At the end of that report, there is the distribution of this report within the Security Branch.  14 divisions were circulated with that report.  I also would like to put that report in.\n\tThen there is a report dated 14th...(intervention).",

That agrees with the general view and my own view that PN was the prefix for an informer working with Port Natal Security Branch and you would see that that informer was under the command or directly reporting to Mr Taylor, Maj Taylor.  The visit is a visit of MK, of Lucky, agent 665 sent by Lucky.  On paragraph 2(8) page 2, you would see that this agent says that he and a Lulu travelled and met a Mr MK Zandile.  He is identified as Charles Ndaba and on the column on  the side, the margin, is the file no. S4/52573.

I will show in the subsequent reports how they would follow through to reach the identity of the person.  Get photographs, do searches to identify the real name of the person, but here they are actually saying, \"not of any security importance\" and you see on the next page that that report had the distribution list, there are 14 groups to which it was distributed.  Anyone of them reading it is seeing Jabo is not of any importance, don't waste your time.  On the other hand if the person is a confirmed agent or informer, the person would feature in the report as PN, as you see on page 1.  Page 1 says the informant PN664 has established the following information.  So no name appears there, no identity appears and it is distributed to these 14 groups, but they have no way of knowing the identity.  What they have is the content of the report.  That's my response to that, that measures could be taken, but I will show other measures that could be taken because you then turn to the next report J2, which is page 13.  There you will find that the report has been filed on the 14th of September 1988 and it has been filed by Capt H J P Botha, the man who says he recruited Charles Ndaba to be his informant.  He compiles this report and what he does in the report is to say, I'm confirming that the photographs circulated to all of you is a photograph of Charles Ndaba. And Charles Ndaba's name appears in paragraph 2 as Z Ndaba - FA4190 PN, but the distribution list for that is to 15 different sections.  If Charles Ndaba was Capt Botha's informant, would he hand him over to the wolves deliberately, when he has the mechanisms to conceal his identity?\n\tThe next report Sir is a report dated 18th of July 1988.  And this one is handed in by Sgt Lodge Labuschagne, page 15 and it deals with a black woman called Ellen.  On page 16 once more paragraph 2 the identification is Charles Zakhele - Charles Ndaba FA 4190 Port Natal, file number S4/62573.  Not a PN number and its distribution list is at the bottom of that page.  And then if you look, Sir, because of the character of Charles Ndaba, to Exhibit J4, page 17, that report is dated 1987.  Why have I brought it?  I have brought it here to say that that is how seriously Pretoria saw Charles as a military adversity, that it is not an accident that at Piet Retief and in the ambush in Swaziland in June 1988, efforts were made to get Eugene de Kock's unit to eliminate him.  That's June 1988.  It's no longer two divisions not knowing what they were doing because this distribution list includes in some of the documents C20, it includes C10.  \n\tI then turn to page 18 and there the report is dated 31st of August.  That is where again in monitoring all people that they come across in Swaziland, they say in paragraph 2(4) that Z C Ndaba, also known as Charles, has been deported to Lusaka.  But just above that Sir, you will see 2(3) R P Lalla, permanently resettled in Maputo.  Both of these comrades of mine, because of the sterling work that they were doing in Swaziland and because they were seasoned in Swaziland, were withdrawn and subsequently re-entered South Africa in 1990 as part of Operation Vula.  Lalla was arrested at 1 o'clock at the safe-house at the Knoll, but I'll come to that later.  I thought I should put these reports to show Charles' background, his calibre, the nature of the monitoring by Pretoria, the fact that his identity was being circulated with 15 sections by Capt Botha and those sections included sections that would try to eliminate him and therefore I certainly challenge the view that his deportation was arranged to Zambia in order to save his life.",

            "I have only so far given the sample of reports that had reached us while working in Vula inside the country, but there are other bases on which the question rises about Charles.  He was then suggested by Headquarters that he should come in as a reinforcement to our personnel.  He was crossed into South Africa in the first week of February.  He was put in a unit under Mbuso Shabalala, not above.  Mbuso Shabalala was heading that section.  The weekend of their disappearance they had gone out to work in KwaMashu which was one of their assigned areas of work.  We already became aware by Monday, I think it's the 9th, that these two men had disappeared.  I was in Johannesburg at the time and I received a secret communication from Kibusa, Siphiwe Nyanda, to say that these two cadres had not returned.  We immediately agreed in communication that a search should be made to ascertain what had happened to these two.  Secondly, that measures should be taken to abandon all safe-houses that these two cadres knew of and that was not because we suspected them to be agents, that was because it was a necessary step for our own security.  Now, we then ascertained that Charles Ndaba had not kept certain appointments on Friday the 6th.  he had also not kept appointments on Saturday.  As regards Mbuso Shabalala, there was an appointment that he was supposed to have with Charles Ndaba on the Sunday and Mbuso Shabalala's family said that he was with them on Sunday.  We then arranged through the family for lawyers to begin making inquiries with C R Swart on the Monday and Tuesday.  So, my sequence of the arrests is different from the one here.  I also have a different sequence of the arrests on the 12th.",

            "Chairperson, it is impossible that Charles Ndaba should have the information on paragraph 8 and 9 at the moment of his entry into the country.  I say this for the following reasons.  First of all, the identity of myself and Siphiwe Nyanda who entered the country in July 1988 was so strictly guarded that even the National Executive Committee of the ANC was informed in different that I was in hospital in the Soviet Union since 1987 and that Siphiwe Nyanda was undergoing a field officer's training course lasting 5 years at a military academy in the Soviet Union.  Nobody, no cadre being sent in the country, would be given that information, it's completely contrary to any simple underground rule.  The cadre could have got arrested crossing the border at Swaziland, got tortured and immediately under torture says, \"But Mac and Siphiwe are in the country\" and when the person settled in the country, we always only revealed our identity on very strict need-to-know.  What was Vula's mission?  Paragraph 8.  Each cadre was only briefed about their specific area of work.  We were not going to tell them that we were co-ordinating the underground political section, military section, Intelligence section and the overt sections of struggle and take the risk that in the course of their highly risky work, if they got arrested by accident and were tortured, they should reveal the top committee.  Certainly we'd learned from Rivonia and we'd learned from our own arrests that you don't do things like that.  Charles Ndaba, I say he was brought in on the 7th of February.  By then the February 2 speech had been delivered by F W de Klerk.  Shortly, a few days after the 7th of February, Nelson Mandela was released.  The situation was now extremely fluid.  In fact, precisely because of that situation, we began to introduce systematic discussion, to talk about the option of what we do with the underground as this situation develops, not in order that we take the decision, but in order that we prepare our forces for whatever would be decided by the leadership.  So Charles Ndaba would not know this overall mission, this is ex post facto, we were not going to reveal our communications systems, we had spent 50 000 pounds developing our communications system, even the Soviets wanted it from me and I wouldn't give it to them and you think I would give it to a cadre to say \"you man it\"?  Communications was manned by myself directly with one person working under me, by Siphiwe Nyanda directly.  I and Siphiwe Nyanda did the transmissions, we personally did the receiving and we personally did the decoding until work expanded to the point where I took on Janet Glove as my secretary and Siphiwe took on one person in Durban.  The only other person who was briefed about the communications system was Ronnie Kasrils who entered the country in February 1990 as part of the top leadership structure and he was briefed about the communications system and was being taught to use it because he would hive off to take command of a particular geographical area.  That's where the communication was.   No way Charles Ndaba would know that.",

Indeed Goodwill Sekakane was an askari and he was executed and I believe his body has now been exhumed and identified and he was killed.

            "Paragraph 59, Chairperson, it's difficult for me to control my language when I speak about paragraph 59 because it's the biggest give-away to a cover-up conspiracy.  It says there that\n\"Charles Ndaba was privy to vital information about Pretoria systems.  The first ones\", it says, \"is that during Charles's stay in Swaziland and Zambia, Ndaba was coupled to the communications and logistics infrastructure of the Security Branch\".\nNow I have shown you documents which indicate that if we were to suppose he was recruited, he could only have been recruited late in 1988, but within weeks of recruitment would have gone out of Swaziland.  What infrastructure would he have learned?  What communications system would he have got known to except some telephone numbers to phone?  Then we were told by Capt Botha that when he was sent, told to go to Zambia, he was given no contacts in Zambia.  What logistical infrastructure and communications network of Port Natal would he have found out in Zambia and by his own admission Capt Botha says he had no contact with him while he stayed in Zambia, in fact he claims that the contact was established 4 to 6 weeks before the 7th of July inside the country at the initiative of Charles Ndaba.  What infrastructure?  So it puts this huge word, communications and logistical infrastructure that Charles Ndaba would have got to know in Swaziland and Zambia and then uses that to justify his murder.  Then it says:\n\"these communication and logistical networks were not only used by Charles Ndaba\"\nbut they themselves said that he didn't use it.  I find that diabolical.  Then it goes that he had information about the Intelligence network in the Security Branch in Durban but they say in their evidence that he made contact 4 to 6 weeks before the 7th of July, which places it at its earliest in May and then goes on to say that he had 2 to 3 meetings and did not have him meet other people.  What again, is this huge word Intelligence network?  If Durban, Port Natal was working that way, making an individual informer know that elaborate network, then they don't deserve to be called Durban Security Branch.  And then, Chairperson, we come back to the smearing of Charles Ndaba's name, after they have murdered him because in the next paragraph they then throw a hint that there was another informant inside Vula.  I am satisfied, head on the block, they did not penetrate Vula.  I'm ready to say, on the contrary and Capt Botha referred to me the other day when he was giving evidence, he said: \"Ask Mac Maharaj about the houses in Reservoir Hills and Chatsworth\".  Sir, I won't tell you about that unless you ask me, but he raised the matter.  Those two incidents shows that we had penetrated Durban Security Branch right to the top.  These four reports that I have filed today is from that stack.  You show me one from the ANC, from Vula.",

Pres Mandela has said, what is negotiation about except negotiating with the enemy.  He has told the Irish at Arniston, \"you don't negotiate with your friends\" and when we have said, \"How do you sit down with this Bantustan leader?\"  He has said, \"but I sit down with de Klerk, who's hands are dripping with blood\".
