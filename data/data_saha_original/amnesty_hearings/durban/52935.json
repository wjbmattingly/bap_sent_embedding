There would be a sack and you would plug the target, then you would spread your hands with this flour and plug this target.\n\tAfter we did that he told us that we will go with him to \"skietbaan\".

We were trained by those guys I mentioned.  We were using various or assortments of rifles.

Lieutenant Joubert and Colonel Roots were using a private car.\n\tWe left and we went to Nelspruit.  That is when I first saw Nelspruit.  I used to read about Nelspruit but never was there in person.  After we arrived in Nelspruit, Sergeant Venter parked next to a post office and there were other cars, 4X4's which were parked there and there were AWB members in AWB uniforms. \n\tAfter that he alighted from the car and talked to them for quite some time, discussing with them.  After that he came back to us, that is Sergeant Venter, and told us that we cannot continue with the plan or execute this action because things are not going as well and we went back to prison.\n\tWe knew very well that we were better inmates than others.  We could visiting locations and visiting our girlfriends as well and we were never using prison uniforms.  That's when I met Sophie and I fell in love with her and she fell pregnant, Sophie.

I know him as Mr Aubrey, even during the time of the investigation they saw that the farm was written \"Aubrey Farm\".\n\"After we were relaxed and we had privileges of doing all such things.  In 1993 I was discharged, March 15.\n\tI told Sophie and Sophie was the one who came for me at the prison and we went to the location after Lieutenant Venter discharged me.  I went to Sophie's house.  Sophie came from Witbank but was a lodger where we went to.  \n\tI spent three days and from there I came back here in kwaZulu Natal.  I came with Sophie.  They know Sophie, my family, that is my aunts and my uncles have met Sophie.  Sophie explained so much about our affair and my activities in prison.  Sophie was playing a special role in my life as I was in prison.\n\tI got to Mtembisweni where my family was residing.  When I got there I realised and found out that my family had moved from there.  I met Themba Nyoga.  Themba Nyoga was my childhood friend, a bit older than I was or than I am.  That's when I discovered that Themba Nyoga was a leader of IFP, when I got there and he called for me.  He sent his boy to call me at my in-law's. \t\n\tI went to Nyoga's house.  There was a tea-room nearby my in-law's there.  That's where I found Themba Nyoga and he had in his possession a shotgun and Mdugi's son as well had a gun.  There was another boy who had a 38 in his possession and there was Dumisani and other boys who knew me quite well because I was residing there.  \n\tThat's when Themba Nyoga explain in detail with regard to my family and told me that they moved to Ndwedwe.  He told that there in Thembisweni was a dominant area of IFP.  And told me that the ANC members had moved.  He does not even want to see them because they want to confiscate the land and they are working hand-in-hand with the Xhosa, Mandela.\n\tI explained to him, Nygo, that I was arrested before all these things, before the struggle.  I fought and I was an active member in the struggle around 1976.  That's when I was expelled from school as well.\n\tAs to what was happening currently, I'm not updated.  As for all these activities about IFP and ANC, I did not have or I bore no knowledge inasfar as that was concerned.  All I knew was that all the people that were residing there were under a certain King but I appreciate your explanation in as far as all this political feud is concerned. \n\tI said there was no problem, I would go and think about what you've just told me.  When I looked around the houses that I was used to and knew very well, I realised that all the houses were burnt.  I took a walk to some other place and I realised that most of the boys who were there actively were shot and they showed me that they were being shot by Themba Noyga's followers. \n\tI had no money to live in Mtembisweni for Ndwedwe and he gave me some money.  That is the person who gave me R1 500-00 to go and locate my family.  That's when I left and I met a certain boy who left with my mother from Mtembisweni and who knew very well as to where my mum was.  \n\tI arrived at Ndwedwe.  When I got there I discovered that my sisters were there, although one of my sisters was in Johannesburg.  My family was there and the little ones were there as well.  They took me to my brother-in-law.  That's when I discovered that my other sister was in Johannesburg.  I found my wife was there at home.  My brother-in-law called Johannesburg because he had the numbers and got me connected with my sister  Gabsile and my sister told me to relax at home, she's be coming back.\n\tThat was the time when I discovered that Ndwedwe was predominantly IFP.  I waited for my sister until she got there.  That's when my sister related so much to me and told me that I should stop all these immoral acts and collect myself.  I agreed to that and she gave me some money that I should change my lifestyle and go get or buy some new clothes and explained to me how my mum passed away. My mum was shot, shot by Ngubane.  She was attacked.  My mum was harassed and tortured until she had high blood pressure and until she also got sugar-diabetes and subsequently passed away.  I was residing there at the time, knowing very well that the IFP was dominant.  \n\tOne day I saw my house was set alight and was burning and I identified the boys who set my house alight and I saw them running away.  I went to the police station at Ndwedwe.  It was that time when the police took my statement and told me to go back to the community.  My brother-in-law told me to go and report this matter to Mfageni Gumede, that here I'm being burnt and I don't know why.  Gumede took me to Zondi.\"",

            "If I remember well I think I last said we were at Mfayela and coming back, after he had identified the house of, identified the taxi owner's house and I was explaining about the distance as to who should be hit and after that we should confiscate some cars and burn the people.  We were talking about the ammunition in the house and about the Ntelezi. I think that is what I last said, I'm not sure.\n\"At the time when we were in the house we had two AK's, the one that I had in my possession and the one that was in Mfayela's son's possession and who brought it to the house.  He left to go fetch the R1.  You see they don't keep such guns in the house.  These guns that we used to kill people were always hidden outside the house.  The guns that were there at the time were two AK's, one R1 and one 9mm 9 shot, not a long one but 9 shot.  The one that would have been used to kill the taxi driver and the 9 long that I had in my possession, the one that I said I got it from the station commander and that I did not know his name but now I know he is Hlengwa although he said to me in prison I must not divulge his name.\n\tAt the time as I'd already explained there was a plastic bag full of ammunition and we started loading this ammunition in the guns and Simo gave us socks to put on our hands and hand gloves so that our fingerprints won't remain on the cartridges.  In case we shoot and the cartridges are lying around, it should not be associated with us in any way because police from Ndwedwe were not longer trusted, they were looked at as hit squad because they were killing around and terrorising around.   \n\tBut one thing painful I knew was that the people of Mokomo depended on the stability and little did they know that this was the third force.  They would pretend as if they were patrolling and yet they have hidden agendas that they would like to fulfil.  People did not know about this.  You see when you don't know you are as good as not seeing or blind.  \n\tAt that time we loaded our guns and I had a 9 in my possession, the very one that I had and Mdu took AK and Zwelaki Mbambo took another AK as well and Tendi Dungweni took the 9 shot that I referred to and Simbishisi took the R1 that I referred to as well.  This R1 was known very well by Ntindi and Dungweni and Mdu and Zwelaki.  \n\tAs soon as you shoot using it, it was an automatic one, so that it will not discharge a cartridge.  You have to change it and cock it and it will only be then that it will discharge, just like 303.  That is how it operated.  \n\tThen I took my gun because Sishi had that one and I took my 9 one and gave it to him and I took, in other words we exchanged guns.  They could not use that gun and I was the only one who was well conversant with the use of that particular gun.  They were not given automatics.  I think these whites did not trust themselves, although those Boers who were so filthy did not trust themselves.  I know ANC wants so much information and I'm prepared to divulge that much.  We left the house and Simo was already waiting for us with a bucket just outside the house.  \n\tYou see right next to Mfayela's house there was a caravan that was parked there and there was an open space.  There are just ordinary houses, one will not think that the owner is the parliament member.  That open space that is where the Cressida was parked and he reversed the Cressida a bit, Mfayela himself and stood behind.  In other words the car turned and was parked facing the opposite direction.  This is how you go to Mfayela's house.  On the left it was an open space and that's where he turned the car facing it to the opposite direction.  There was a street going upwards, something like a T-junction.  You see this is how I'm demonstrating it.  There was no any other road ahead, it was a T-junction and you either turn left or right.  \n\tSimo was standing there with a bucket behind the car and we were sprinkled, we were told to stir this Ntelezi inside the bucket using firearms, the back of the firearms.  In other words, dumping the guns in the Ntelezi and we were told to leave and not to look at the back, we should just go forward.  I knew very well that Ntelezi sometimes is mixed with pieces of people's flesh or flesh and I had my own reservations inasfar as what we were doing.  We therefore left the place.  The Cressida left and charged forward instead of going backwards and it turned a bit and left to the right-hand road and went towards the left.  And ...[indistinct] us we should lie down and kill the person there.  Simbisishi knew the person very well, the taxi owner.  \n\tSimbisishi knew the taxi owner very much because his house was not too far away from where the taxi owner's house was and where the Lindilani people were harboured as well, he knew very well.  That place was used as a place of cover for such people who would be in hiding.  \n\tAs you approach the taxi owner's house you would have to walk upward and leave the other road which is turning, off-ramping from the main road and you go upward and you pass this off-ramp.  We alighted from the car and now joined the other route which was leading us to the taxi owner's house.  \n\tAnother thing that I may say which I believe I should say is:  we were using camouflage uniform or clothing, camouflage clothing, yes and Simbi had that on.  \n\tWe stopped there right on the road leading to the taxi owner's house.  It was towards dusk.  We saw another kombi approaching and Simbi said: 'Yes, this is the car, this is his very own car.'  We emerged immediately and pointed the guns towards the kombi.  \n\tSo there were two.  The first one in front was an E20 and the guy surrendered and lifted up his hands and we approached the vehicle and opened the door and gave the gun to Simbi.  I took my 9 and put it in my pocket and I said: 'Leave, we are in a rush, we want to go to Nduzuma.  If he remembers very well, the taxi driver that is, he will recall my words.  \n\tThere was another person, a passenger inside, he was resisting all this and the other boys wanted to assault him and I said no, they should wait a bit.  I said to him: 'Stop resisting because you will be in danger in no time'.  I told him that: 'We can leave you or drop you at your house'.  And Simbi said: 'This is the one that - this is not the one that we are looking for'.  This is why we did not even shoot because he was not there.  Simbi realised that this is not the person we are looking for because he knew the person very well.  \n\tThen we discovered that this is not the person we are after.  I said to the person: 'Well shift, give us some room.  If you wish we could drop you at that house'.  And he said: 'How do you know that house'?  I said: 'I know that house, we could drop you if you wish but if you want you can accompany us to Nduzuma and we will bring you back'.  \n\tI was winding away time because I knew very well that this is not the person we are looking for or after.  He seemed a bit delirious or confused and he resisted, he said he did not want to come along with us.  \n\tThe old man's house was not too far away from us.  I drove the kombi myself, the one that was in front the first one, the E20 one.  We got inside, we drove right into the premises and turned around a bit or made a u-turn and right next to the house which had ...[end of tape] said to the others they should get outside the car.  He was not too sure why I was saying that because we already had a car. He seemed a bit confused as to why we were not leaving because we already had the car whilst we were whiling away time waiting for the taxi owner to arrive.  \n\tAs the other one was knocking at the door, Ntini fired.  I heard him screaming, the driver that is, the other one was just a boy and he said: 'Father open the door, please open the door', shouting, saying that.  And he shot twice.  I asked him: 'Why are you shooting because we are not shooting these people'?  He answered back and said: 'This one is troublesome and resisting all the instructions'.  I said to him: 'Please don't shoot because this will call for attention, people will be aware of what's happening, neighbours that is'.  \n\tWe saw the next kombi approaching, the second one that is, and we went down, driving down and I parked on the side.  The other kombi stopped.  Then Simbi said: 'This is the target, this is the person we are looking for, this is the very one who is inside the other car'. \n\tDongweni was in front and alighted from the vehicle.  I think the other one wanted to ask: 'Where are you going at this time'?, wanting to know what's happening because he saw the car approaching the gate and yet it was supposed to have been parked because it was after hours.  He shot him here, right on the head using the 9mm.  I was a bit terrified and I got outside of the vehicle and I saw a woman who was with the taxi owner and said something that I did not hear and said: 'I'm beginning to be powerless'.  He almost shot the women and I said: 'No, don't shoot the woman'.  I said to the woman: 'Get off the vehicle'. \n\tWe thought we should go back to the other car which was already facing the exit.  As I tried to reverse the kombi overturned.  Mdu was given me the directions as I was reversing the kombi.  Before I knew it the kombi overturned.  I kicked the windscreen and exited.\n\tThe other kombi had its lights on and I could see that I had a chance to reach the vehicle, the E20 and drive off with it but we left that alone and decided to walk away by foot.  \n\tI was not too sure if that was a whistle or a trumpet that was being blown in that house but there was some noise that we heard, sounding something like a trumpet and some gunshots as well we heard but we could not see as to who was being shot at.  There was a person already who had gone to Mfayela to report that somebody had been shot already at close range and he rushed us to our houses and he got rid of us immediately from the vicinity.  We went back to our house.  He dropped us there and he went back.\n\tThe following day the white bakkie came again. When I got to Mfayela's house, - I think the kombi I want to talk about now was red, and there was another one, a white one.  There were people from Mpumalanga and Mkukuza and Dosiana.  There is a mistake there on the statement, they say Hosiana, it Mkukuza, people coming from Mkukuza not Hosiana.  So that is an error that's being reflected in the statement.  \n\tWhen I got there I realised that there are already police and everything has been arranged and people should be hit or assaulted at night.  The person I'm referring to I did make mention of in the statement although he does not appear in my application.\n\tAnd even at the time Sister Sheila was investigating this I told her about it but I am so sure, dead sure that at Somkomo there was a person we shot in the street.  He was just walking on the street and we shot the person.  We were driving along the streets of Somkomo when we shot that particular person, that I'm dead sure of.  The cartridges that might have been recovered from the person was the shotgun ...\"\n...[intervention]",

            "This is how I will explain this, let me go through my calendar of 1993 and give you accurate information.  It may be the 1st or the 2nd, I'm not too sure for the taxi driver but I'm think the taxi driver issue was around 29 November.  Then on the 30th, it may be on the 30th because these operations happened one after another.\n\tI remember I was feeling sleepy at this particular incident because it's been some time that I had not had rest because of being so involved and busy.  This must have happened around the time between the 30th and the 1st of December.\n\"It was at the time when I found people or a gang from Mkukuza and Mpumalanga.  Now amongst that gang the person I remember very well, explicitly so was Mashunisa.  That was a nickname because they will say before it's dusk there's got to be a person who should be killed, so the name Mashunisa stemmed from that understanding.\n\tThey were there at Sishi, that's where the police had gathered as well and there were various operations.  Some left with Giba in a bakkie and we used an Indian bakkie of Tongaat.  I think about 16 to 18, that was the number of the group I belonged to.  \n\tThat is why I'm saying I am definitely sure that we killed a person or we shot a person because Giba came and joined us and it was said that he's bringing guns from Ulundi.  Gipa was known.  Whenever Gipa was being seen he would be driving this bakkie because he was transporting the guns from Ulundi, from Powen, the very guns that he referred to as the kwaZulu Natal guns.  They were the guns that were used to terrorise people and he had AK's as well and the guns that were being used by the ZP's, G3's and shotguns.  He brought them with as well.  We were about 18 in that bakkie.\n\tWe also had other people like Stolz, Sabata as well as Keke and Nzama.  \n\tWe were in the company of those police in our group and there was another policeman I did not know at the time.  I did not know his surname.  He was from Ndwedwe.  He was the one organising people or a gang from Mkukuza.  We left.  \n\tI may not know all the people who gathered there.  You get there and you take your weapon and off you go on a mission, you don't have time to figure around as to who is who and the names as well.  I told myself I will give a full report after everything has happened.  \n\tI took into consideration the police and the Boers who would arrive at Mfayela's house to give explanations or directions as to who should be killed.  We left with that group.  The one that was with Gipa reported that a woman and a man were killed.  People who were affiliated to ANC I suppose.  That's the report they gave back, that a man and a woman were killed.  But our group killed a person who was walking along the streets.\n\tAnd another house that was shot far away from where we were we did not get into the premises or the house but we shot from outside.  This is what our group did.  After we left to give the report to Father Mfayela.  He was respected because of killing people.  \n\tI then decided to change my mind because there were other people of ANC that I had already leaked some information to.  I also said: 'We are the ones who are killing people, given the mandate by the parliament to kill people around.  We are the ones, it's not the Ndwedwe policemen as such who were the killers'.  \n\tYou would think those were the Ndwedwe policemen who were killing, yet it was not true, it was us who were killing.  Even the community of Ndwedwe did not trust that much the police but they did not know or rather they knew little about the activities of my group but I know very well that Mufumadi must not entertain these police in the police force because they are killers.  Mfayela is a killer himself and his hands are full of blood and he is spoiling the whole parliament of kwaZulu Natal.\n\tInasfar, or with regard to the other incidents or issues I may explain thusfar.  There are things that I was not directly involved in, like the third force activities of kwaZulu Natal.  I'm not in a position to divulge such information to the Truth Commission with regard to those activities but what I've already given to the Commission must be taken further than this because I know very well the activities of kwaZulu Natal although I'm not in a position to divulge more ...\"",

In other words I did not eat for the whole day, just for saying: \"Please give me a cigarette\".\n\tAfter that I never encountered any problems.  I went to Medium B and I have no knowledge of any conviction there.  It was at Open Camp when I had another offence.  I was not even aware that I had committed an offence.  I was with the Captain, a white Captain by the name of Stolz, Stols or Stolz, somewhere there, a white guy, I said: \"Captain yes, I've committed an offence and I know and he said: \"Because you agree or you do accept this, you will not eat, you will have to be drinking water.\"  I don't remember if it was for five days.  I would drink water, samp water.  \n\tAnd again I committed an offence at work and he said: \"You see my boy, you are stubborn, I will not give you food so that you stop these offences\".

            "Right, we will then postpone this matter until 08H30.  The reason why I came to do it in the court here was that I thought there would be other members of the family etc., who would want to know, who might have an interest in coming to hear but I see they're coming in now, so if you could just wait for a few seconds.\n\tFor those persons who have just entered the premises, we've been informed that the legal representatives require some more time, would prefer to have some more time to prepare their submissions that they're going to make to this panel and that it had been agreed between them and we as a panel do not have any problems with that, that the matter be argued on Friday morning ad 08H30 in the morning at this same venue.  The matter is then accordingly postponed to Friday morning at 08H30.  The date on Friday will be the 23rd of October 1998, at 08H30 in the morning.  It will just be for the reception of submissions at that period.  I should imagine that the decision in the matter will be reserved so that we can digest the learned argument that we will be receiving and we won't just give an ex tempore decision.  So the matter is then postponed to Friday, 23rd October at 08H30 for argument.  Thank you very much.\nCOMMITTEE ADJOURNS",
