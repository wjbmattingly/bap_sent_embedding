I will write it down, I will write it one day, but I could never tell you, but it did teach me something and that is that no human being can live alone more than, I think, even 1 month, because there's nothing you can do to survive by yourself every single day.  The basement was an entire wing of the prison, it was actually an entire floor. I felt as the months went by that I was going deeper and deeper into the ground.  Physically I wasn't, but psychologically I was.  I became so psychologically damaged that I used to feel that all these cells, because there were a whole lot of other cells that were empty but they were locked, that to feel all these cells are like coffins and there were all dead people in there.  It was as if I was alive and all these people were dead.  I was so disturbed but I would never, never let the wardresses know, but they did destroy me.  My suggestion is that no prisoner, regardless of their crimes, should ever be in isolation per se,  not even this Section 29 business for two weeks.  I know it serves a purpose but ultimately when it's prolonged, I don't think anybody can handle it.  I've been out of prison now for more than 7 or 10 years, but I haven't recovered and I will never recover, I know I won't.\" I have tried to. Sorry.",
