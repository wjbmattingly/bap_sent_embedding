            "Firstly I would like to express my pain and the hurt that I feel what I did to your family.\n\tI will answer your question by - I don't know whether you were present here yesterday when I explained about how your brother was murdered.  I explained that when we left Umhlane Pumatenja with the gun, the AK47 which he carried, we left the scene.  At that time Sergeant Khumalo had not really approached his gate, we had overtaken him on the way and dropped Umhlane Pumatenja ahead.  I am trying to show that when Khumalo actually arrived at his gate, myself and Romeo were not at that scene, we had already left the scene.  We then hurried to a dusty road to park our car near the dressmaking school that I mentioned yesterday.  Therefore, when Khumalo arrived at the gate, we were not physically there where he was going to be shot but there was only Umhlane Pumatenja whom we had left at the scene.  \n\tTherefore, Umhlane was that had shot him - when I as a commander did not really have control over him, I could not tell him anything at the time because I was not at the particular spot that he was in, I was in the opposite direction.  I mentioned yesterday that we later realised that we were also in Umhlane's line of fire because we were opposite him and therefore the decision to shoot Sergeant Khumalo regardless of the fact that he was speaking to other people who were no longer our targets was made by Umhlane.  By this I'm not trying to shrug off my responsibility, I'm not saying that I was not involved in the death of your brother, I in fact killed him.  His death is amongst the many I am responsible for but what I'm trying to say is that I could not have given any instruction to Umhlane Pumatenja maybe to stop because the opportunity was not right but I had already given him the instruction to shoot Sergeant Khumalo therefore the crime of the murder of your brother rests upon my shoulders.\n\tI understand perfectly well the situation that I have put your family in and I am very sad about it.  I explained that God has at last returned by conscience to me.  I want to say that in whatever way that you can put me in contact with your family, I will give you all my particulars in prison.  You can even come to the prison with the family and I will tell all and say everything to the family.  I can even make statements to the effect that you had nothing to do with the death of your brother so that the family can trust you again.  You did not know anything about it and your brother was not involved with the political activities nor the objectives that we were carrying out at the time.  We didn't even know your brother, he was just unfortunate to be present at a time when a person who was targeted was being shot but I am willing to meet your family to explain that I don't know you and I didn't know your brother but it happened.  What happened, happened as I've explained it.",

Romeo himself eventually bought a BMW car which is also cream white in colour.  There are references, details of where and how or where the car was bought.  One was bought by cash, that is Mogikosi's car, but Romeo had paid a R20 000 deposit on his car and he used to pay of the rest in monthly instalments.  They were almost similar.\n\tI am trying to explain to the Commission that such an incident gave us an impression that maybe there was a car that went missing somewhere as it had emerged that Zuma's car was missing and those who suspected that Romeo had stolen a car, since Romeo had previously been seen driving Bonkosi's car.  But the car that was missing, that is Zungu's car, was charcoal in Bonkosi Dube's car was cream white.\n\tI am trying to explain that there were a lot of possibilities that we looked at to try to explain why there were these allegations that Romeo had stolen a car.  Our main concern was to find a motive behind this allegation.",

            "Firstly Romeo's arrest was very dangerous.  Romeo was one of the people that I trusted in the syndicate therefore he's arrest, when we were so busy involved in such a tense war with African National Congress, if you break or if one of the members of the syndicate was arrested that fact alone would mean that our side would be defeated because there would be someone who was no longer there.  I would use Romeo in intelligence activities as well as well physical activities therefore the IFP would have really lost out if Romeo was no longer involved in our activities.\n\tSecondly, there was people involved in a political battle knowing very well that his arrest was on political grounds.  If I can just explain this, yesterday I said that both these organisations used whatever means to fight off their enemy.  If I can just make an example, one day Umbiasi's house was shot at and this was an IFP house but because we knew that this was done for political reasons, we had to sit down with the local leadership that I mentioned yesterday and devised a way that we're going to use since the ANC had attacked, a way for us to retaliate so that they would be sorry for their actions.\n\tAt that meeting we decided that Mr Zazi Sibande should be a witness in the trial of Umbiasi's shooting.  Zazi Sibande was supposed to testify that he had seen Bongani Nsomi shooting and he had also seen him giving orders to his followers or to his colleagues to shoot.  In actual fact, Bongani Nsomi had never even been there at the scene.  Even Sibande whom we made into a witness was not at the scene of Umbiasi's shooting but because there was a political struggle, we said Zazi Sibande should testify that he had seen Mr Nsomi shooting at Umbiasi's house.  \n\tYou should see how intense the war was, we were using all means because we realised that Bongani was strong and was attacking us and we couldn't get hold of him, we couldn't track him down and therefore it was easier to have him arrested and in jail therefore to get rid of him he would have to be arrested or be killed.  The only thing we hadn't as yet done was to use traditional medicine against him, bewitch him.  That case is known by Mr Nsomi and Sibande was indeed a witness.  Bongani knows very well that he was not there but Sibande did in fact give the evidence that he was there.  So he knew that this allegation that Romeo has stolen a car could be the same strategy that was being used against us because there was this political struggle and each side wanted to defeat the other.",

It mainly happened between Zulu people.  If you are aware of the history of the Zulus they are the kind of people who are used to having faction fights.  These faction fights involved struggles between Indunas, Chiefs and so on.  \n\tEven though this faction fighting stopped, but this spirit of being Zulus remained so when this political struggle started, that was resurrected therefore we should expect that the political war between the Zulus in this province, although it was political, there were other factors that would have influenced it - those factors being cultural.\n\tTraditionally when there's a war, there is no differentiation, you do not target specific persons.  Traditionally speaking your enemies are just there to be shot.  After you've killed the men you will take the women and make them yours.  The war between the ANC and IFP in this province cannot really be separated or differentiated from faction fighting.  In faction fights children are killed, everything is killed, even cats.  If the war begins traditionally, no one is spared.  What happens is that an area that had been declared as an enemy area is annulated therefore we cannot avoid that the war between the ANC and IFP took a similar vein.  You cannot really control a war situation.\n\tEven though I admit that when you sit down and think retrospectively, you realise that you were wrong to kill women and children but when it actually happens it's really a situation that you cannot control.  Such things do happen.  Even in our case it did happen.  Our sisters were killed, people like Mathilda and a lot of other people who may not really be known to this Committee.  Even within the IFP side there were a lot of women who were killed.  I am not by this trying to justify anything but I'm just explaining the situation as it was, as it happened in this province.  Therefore we cannot run away, we do not deny that we have killed innocent people.  \n\tYou can look at the Gommakuta where thirteen people were killed by the Caprivians in collusion with the Boers.  You will remember that women and children were killed there.  I don't care how much IFP denies this but the truth is that the people who were killed there were killed by us for the reason that we were wanting to murder Mr Ndula.  Therefore there is the reason why the IFP slaughtered a goat because they had \nkilled women and children unintentially.  Therefore such things did happen, we should not hide them now that we are here before this Commission.  We are well aware of them and we shoulder that responsibility.",

            "No, that is not the case.  I did not understand it that way.  What I know is that the ANC - for example we as the IFP were declared as a stumbling block.  They regarded us as an obstacle in achieving our goal by reaching the Boer or getting at the Boers.  For example - looking at the Bantustans and the system, this I did speak about yesterday and the fact that we allowed our children to continue with Bantu education whereas they were saying, people should not go to schools, schools should be banned until liberation was acquired.\n\tWe differed in so many things, but, if I were to state here before this Commission, I can see the divide and rule strategy that was being used by the Boers so that we can kill one another because the Boers succeeded in setting the IFP against the ANC so that they could be free.  They kept us at a arms length distance so that we could fight among ourselves without getting any nearer to them.  They succeeded in doing that especially here in KwaZulu Natal because the IFP here was strong with their leader.  I do understand that very well but we can also say that there was nothing the IFP could have done if the ANC had declared us as enemies that had to be attacked. \tWe also heard here before this Commission certain truthful revelations were made that the ANC did plan that Inkosuthelezi should be attacked, that is no secret it is a known fact.  It is also a fact that the IFP also lost about four hundred of their leaders not knowing who killed them without referring actually to the followers, just ask yourself who killed these people and therefore all of these suspicions that the ANC declared the IFP as a stumbling block is actually confirmed.  They wanted to get rid of the IFP first so that they could move on to their enemy and therefore nobody could just sit back whilst being attacked because life is the first priority.\n\tInkatha was therefore forced to do something to defend themselves and the situation worsened.  I do not want to believe that Inkatha's initial aim was to fight in the manner in which they did with the ANC but the situation worsened and they attacked each other.  That is not what they had initially planned but they were forced by the circumstances and the plots that were being carried out, ANC plots to obliterate Inkatha completely.\nADV. MOTATA: Would you say now, Mr Mkhize, that was the propaganda fed to you or that is a situation you realised yourself, taking your advice that we should not theorise, I want to at this instance not to theorise the tenor of your answer to me is that you said you sort of realised the situation - is that what you saw yourself was obtaining\nor was that what you were fed?",

The Nats were behind this and I cannot disown the kind of propaganda that was fed to me by the Boers and as I was growing in politics I started seeing things differently but I can say the Boers succeeded because that was now being added to by what was happening on the ground.  I did see schools burned down by the UDF and I saw people being necklaced, people were petrolled and necklaced and thus the propaganda for the Boers succeeded because of the things that were happening at the time.\n\tCouncillors for example were regarded as IFP members because they belonged to the KwaZulu Government.  I did see them being burned in front of me.  I did see people made to drink the soaps that they had bought from shops.  I did them made to drink those sunlight liquid soaps and the UDF was responsible for this.

She is the one we know very well who instructed that Chaka be killed, she is the one who appointed Dingaan to Chaka's position that is why she ended up dying at Ebakaluzini because of her bravery and deeds perhaps and it is because of those reasons that we referred to Mrs Umbiasi as Mukabai, it is the manner in which she managed to handle things as a woman and we regarded this as bravery and wisdom and we saw the name Mukabai appropriate.  People know very well that a woman who can drive alone in a car, wanted the manner in which she was and when her car approached the ANC people would just flee.",

Mr Ngubane at the time indicated that the this could be dealt with at any stage during the hearing but I would like you to look specifically at the question of the power or the jurisdiction of the sub-committee such as this subpoenaing, issuing subpoena or authorising a subpoena in respect of an implicated person - my prima facie view is that if an implicated person receives notice in terms of section 19 of the act then that implicated person has a right to make submissions, tender evidence or to say nothing at all before the Commission as the implicated person is given a variety of options.  The question is different with regard to section 29 enquiries and if you could then, Mr Ngubane, if you say you're going to look at it over the weekend, you can take a look at this aspect as to whether an implicated person, who has been served notice can be subpoenaed to give evidence thereby detrimentally effecting that implicated person's statutory rights as contained in section 19.4 of the Act and also with regard to Mr Nglange, if one takes a look at section 30 of the Act, sorry Dr. Nglange, he's just been mentioned as an implicated person for the first time during the actual hearing unlike the persons being represented by Mr Hewitt who got prior notification.  If one looks at section 30 of the Act, it will be seen in the event of that happening, then it is incumbent upon the Commission to issue a notification to that implicated person who then has the same options as if a notice had been given in terms of section 19.4.  I just mention this now for you to consider during the course of the weekend.\nI think this would be a convenient time to take the tea adjournment, it's already late.

We went to the KwaZulu Parliament, Sipiwhe went into the office of the Chief Minister and he had a meeting for about two hours.  After that we returned and he told me about everything that had gone on between him and the Chief Minister in the meeting.  He told me that he was not prepared to go work at Ulundi if he was not going to be made a Branch Commander of a certain unit.  He was demanding this because he knew he had a good reputation amongst the IFP leadership especially with the Chief Minister who had spoken several times publicly congratulating him on his activities.  Therefore he put this demand forward that if he was to work at Ulundi he would have to have his own unit.\n\tAt that time the KwaZulu Police did not have a firearm unit so that because of Sipiwhe's demand this unit was launched and Sipiwhe was made a Commander of this firearm unit and the Chief Minister also gave Sipiwhe a house at D Section in Ulundi.",

            "The rally that was held at eSikhawini in 1992 was the rally bigger than any other rally that was ever held there.  It was attended by several top leaderships led by Prince Gideon Zulu.  I can also say that the ANC also had information that the rally was going to be big and the intention of the rally was to drive out all ANC members from eSikhawini.  There are four hostels that were targeted for attack.  On the eve of the rally in the evening the ANC also mobilised it's own people and they put barricades at the entry points of the township and special reference to Songobilo Hostel, Railway Hostel, J1 Hostel - they had stationed people there who were guarding and they were using walkie talkies.  I remember I was with Constance Mangele patrolling at night and on arrival at J1 we were not allowed to gain access or entry into the area.  We were stopped by the ANC marshals with a Mr Dhaliwe who is now deceased and they were using walkie talkies and on asking them why they were doing that and they said they had information to the effect that they were going to be attacked and they did not have confidence in the KwaZulu Police and they decided to organise themselves so that they could communicate to ward of this attack.\n\tWe therefore could not search and the following day in the morning buses that were transporting IFP members started driving in.  They drove in through the H2 enter point near Malangala and they would drive up Makaboso Street and on arriving at Makaboso the buses stopped there and people alighted and they were to start marching from that point to where the rally was to be held at J2.  That is a long distance from that point to J2.  I still remember there were several ANC leaders who were trying to speak to KwaZulu officers that what is done by the IFP followers is wrong because it will start a friction.  Why is it that they drop people off so far away from the stadium because the distance that they would walk to the venue was a distance that included the ANC areas from H2 to Emakandaleni to Main Road dividing H1 and J2 section and the ANC members were not listening, they were not taking into consideration.  The march started there because the aim was to attack from H2 up to Songobilo Hostel and from Songobilo Hostel proceed to J1 attack until up to Shlangalane Hall.  By that time they should have completed the whole eSikhawini and the march proceeded up to the road separating H1 and J2 and this march was led by Amabuto.  Amabuto leaders, should I say, yes leaders who would under normal circumstances be clad in their Zulu attire and they were also carrying these traditional weapons and on arrival at Songobilo Hostel the march being led by Prince Gideon Zulu there was an exchange of gunshots from Songobilo Hostel and during that shootout one person got injured.  \n\tAt the time I was very close to Mr Gideon Zulu another leader from Emabaweni, he was also an IFP leader and on being shot at there I still remember that Gideon Zulu had 303 rifle, he wanted to stand up and shoot back.  I stopped him and pressed him on the ground and some of these Amabuto stopped the followers and indicated to them that they should not proceed.  One woman who came from Ntsele who had intelesi, some traditional herb came out from the march and went to the Sonobilo Hostel and she sprinkled this African medicine around and she came back to join the march and before we actually left, the police, the Internal Stability Unit police of the SAP together with the KwaZulu Reaction Unit, they fired teargas canisters to us at Sonobilo Hostel and as the place was smoky, the march proceeded to the stadium.  The hostel continued shooting but no one else got injured after this medicine was sprinkled and until we arrived at the J2 stadium and at the time when Prince Gideon Zulu was addressing the IFP followers at the stadium - I'd like to explain this - J2 is next to J1, the J2 area belongs to the IFP and the ANC is in charge of J1.  The stadium is at the end of J2 - that simply means just from that point you are nearer to J1.\n\tThere were people who were standing on rooftops at J1.  One of them was wearing a pinafore carrying an AK47.  He started shooting towards the stadium where the IFP followers were gathering.  That's where one woman died.  People were angered at the stadium and when police started attempting to calm them down, Prince Gideon Zulu instructed that they should also attack.\n\tPeople left the stadium and they moved towards J1.  I no longer accompanied Prince Gideon Zulu at the time.  I left in the company of Lieutenant Njale of the B.S.I. and Lieutenant Njale who was Station Commander at Inzani together with Brigadier Msemela and one Captain whose surname I have forgotten - Captain Skekane and we drove to J1 across and when we arrived at the place where the gunshots were being fired from we found IFP members together with Amabuto shooting at the house and trying to burn it as well.\n\tThere was a girl who was sleeping in the house, they got inside and killed her.  They opened the garage - there was a car parked in the garage and they took it out and they also burned the car.  They took everything what was inside - T.V. sets, televisions, radios etc and they looted these things. \n\tThe whole J1 was under attack so that all the KwaZulu together with the SAP police did not even attempt to stop them.  I still remember Brigadier Msemela on arrival at the house that I've just spoken about he said these people should hurry up and get out of the place.  The whole of J1 was attacked and many people died until they got to Shlangalane Hall where dinner was to be served.  Dinner was not partaken of because Prince Gideon Zulu was so angry, he was angry with myself and Dina and Malanduna and other who were present and he accused us of not having done our job because the ANC is still very strong in the area.  He started reprimanding the local level leaders to the same effect and he referred to Insileni where there is not even a single ANC member because there is a flag ahoist in the area to the presence of the IFP and he wanted to the same flag to be hoisted in eSikhawini.  \tHe said there was to be a second march and he referred to it as a march to clean the pots and he wanted a situation that there would be no single ANC member in the area during the time of the march.  That was the situation and position until we parted ways in the evening.",

Therefore every detective was under Captain Manzini.  Because the IFP believed in that all KwaZulu Police were their uncle, they could kill ANC members in broad daylight without any fear and the reaction unit under Captain Masinga would arrest them and their cases would be investigated by detectives under Captain Manzini.  In that way there was dissatisfaction amongst IFP members that IFP youth is arrested when they fight the ANC.  They went to complain to Brigadier Msemela.  Mrs Umbiasi and B.B. Biela the Mayor were the people who went and they had a discussion with Brigadier Msemela.  From there Mrs Umbiasi requested to see me at her house in the evening.  I went there - at the time I was in the prevention of crime unit, I wore a uniform on duty. \n\tMrs Umbiasi explained that in the meeting Brigadier Mia had made a suggestion to the effect that the reaction unit and the detectives unit should infiltrate, that is hit squad members should be able to infiltrate these units so that IFP members would not be arrested or they would bar the arrest of IFP members.  Fortunately, Dina Mkhize was already in the reaction unit but we didn't have a hit squad member within the Detective Unit.  It was then suggested that I make an application, take it to the Station Commander and indicate that I want to join the Detective Unit.  I would then work in this unit and I would then look or prevent all other investigations that related to cases against IFP members.\n\tI made the application.  My branch commander, Warrant Officer Khumalo refused me or declined that I join the Detective Unit.  I reported this to Brigadier Msemela and he said I should make another application and take it to him directly.  I did so and I took it to Brigadier Msemela himself and he approved it.

They kicked the door open, got inside the house and pointed with guns at me and then they started searching the other rooms.  When I asked them what they wanted they said they were looking or searching for weapons and that they had information that I had AK47's in my house.  Because I was alone in the house and because I had been attacked several times in the house I had two AK47's under my bed and the rest were in the trunk locked away.  They found these two guns under the bed.  After this the white sergeant came in and he turned on the light because they had not turned on the light before but they had their torches on.  On turning on the light he was shocked and he asked if I was not a KwaZulu policeman\tand I said yes and he said \"are you stationed at eSikhawini?\" and I said that is so and he requested the other policemen to leave the house, he wanted to speak to me alone.  They left and he said to me \"how do you work, how do you operate at the eSikhawini Police Station?\" and I said I didn't understand what he was saying and he replied that they had received information from Crime Stop that my house J2 4091, that certain MK members resided at this house and they were armed, that he was there having been accompanied by a KwaZulu police member who had identified the house and who had initially phoned Crime Stop and given them that information.\n\tI asked who that policeman was and he said we should go outside because this policeman was outside.  Because I did not quite trust him, I took my gun and went out with him.  On arriving outside I saw two Inyalas outside and behind these two Inyalas were two vans, one of them AZP777 from eSikhawini, it was stationery.  On nearing the van I saw that the driver was Sergeant Dlamini who was in the hit list that had been supplied by the IFP leadership.  There was also a boy called Mbuso in the passenger seat who resided at H2 but his home was at Langezwa.  This boy was not a policeman but he was an ANC member.  He was dressed in camouflage uniform from the KwaZulu Police.  I was shocked to see this.  There was also Constable Kadela from the eSikhawini Police Station.  \n\tWhen I approached the car I said \"these people are drunk\" and this white Sergeant said Dlamini should get out of the car because he wanted to test his liquor level.  Dlamini pretended to be getting out but he did not he just pressed on the car and sped off.  We went across the road trying to block his way and he just came straight for us and we just had to get off the road.  \n\tThis white policeman then apologised and said because they had broken the door they would arrive at eSikhawini Police Station and go to Brigadier Msemela and they would make a full statement on the incident so that the state could refund me so that I could fix my door.  \n\tI went to Mrs Umbiasi's house and reported the matter to her.",

She was at home together with Israel Hlungwane and we discussed Daliwe briefly after which myself Dina and Zwele Dlamini got into the car and we went to J1 to look for him.  We saw his green car, it was parked next to house and there were some people talking to him but the cars engine was running, ready for leaving.  We drove past him and we confirmed that he is the one driving and we stopped at a T-Junction in J1 and after a short while his car drove past us and we followed him.  He joined the Main Road to eSikhawini just next to J1.  \n\tI was driving the car at the time, Dina was occupying the passenger seat and Zwele Dlamini back seat.  We followed him and we concluded that he was going to take a right turn at the cross, proceed to Sonobilo Hostel.  We overtook his vehicle and took a right turn and we went to wait for him at the Sonobilo Hostel gate because we knew that they used to lock the gate.  He would delay there and we would get an opportunity to shoot him there and after the turn as we were proceeding, he indicated to turn towards the left and that's what he did.  He took the road to Bongoye and I quickly made a U-turn and followed him and approaching the Moholoholo Hill near the bush Dina suggested that we shoot him then and there.  Dina had a G3 rifle - I drove and pretended to be overtaking his vehicle and as Dina's window was directly facing his window I brought my vehicle closer to his.  Dina tried to shoot but the gun jammed.  \n\tAt that point Daliwe was not aware what was happening because it was dark.  Dina tried to fix the gun and he made his second attempt and still the gun jammed.  At that point Daliwe was beginning to suspect that something was happening so Zwele from behind indicated that he is ready, I should bring him closer, direct opposite to him.  I drove a little faster so that Zwele's window could be directly opposite to that of his, then Zwele fired a shot using a 7.65 mm pistol and after that we saw the car moving off the road and I drove faster and Dina tested his gun to see why it was jammed and this time it was ready, it was now shooting.  \n\tWe fled and took the Port Danford Road and we went back to eSikhawini and we went to the police station to confirm that he is indeed shot and indeed a report had already been received that he had been shot and he is dead and we then moved on to Mrs Umbiasi's place where we reported that we fared well and we explained how everything happened.",

Dina was the one driving at the time, he tried to take different turns, trying to make out as to whether the car would keep following us.  The van kept following us until we joined the road to Empangeni and we started fleeing really and he would also turn off the headlights and we would argue in the car, some would say he should stop, especially Zwele suggested that Dina should stop and just shoot at the police and we differed on this - some felt we cannot shoot the police and we ended up not shooting them but we fled until we took the Endabayake Road.  On arrival near Imubeni we stopped the car and Zwele took the AK47's the ones that were illegal and the ones that we kept behind were the ones that were legal and they stayed at the sugar cane field so that when the police came they should only discover the legal firearms in our possession and we proceeded to a shop that was near the road.  We bought some drinks, me and Dina and we stood at the verandah and as we were standing there we saw this van driving past the shop.  We got back into the car and drove back.

Those who did not want to join the IFP should ultimately realise that they were not protected and therefore they should move and vacate eSikhawini so that the whole of eSikhawini would be an IFP area.\n\tThat would be easier for the IFP leaders at eSikhawini because as we have already explained that there are four sections at eSikhawini.  All these other three sections are ANC sections.  It is only J2 that is IFP and these three are the ones that were attacked and that is where people died.  J2 was not attacked, nobody died there as well and that simply explains the fact that if a person was a member of the IFP was therefore protected, such a person was protected.\n\tIf something was going to happen or something similar to that happened which happened at Ensilini, people knew there, people who were members of the ANC.  \n\tDina has also given an example of Bonani Insomi, he was one of the ANC leaders who were prominent in Empangeni, he resided at Ensileni himself as well but he was attacked with his followers and they were expelled from Ensinleni.

            "As we had been instructed to attack ANC members in large numbers, this required that we had a vehicle at our disposal and we did not really want to use the Mayor's car because it was well known in the area.  This complaint was taken to Ulundi to M.Z. Khumalo and Prince Gideon Zulu and Malandona - Mr Luthuli.  They then delivered a car from the Chief Minister's Department.  This car was delivered by Mr Cele who worked at Ulundi.  It was a combi, a Mitsubishu, white in colour.  We found Mr Cele at Mrs Umbiasi's house, it was the first time that I saw him.  Mrs Umbiasi introduced him to us and explained that the Chief Minister, Dr. Buthelezi had heard our grievance that we did not have transport therefore they'd issued this vehicle together with M.Z. Khumalo and Prince Gideon Zulu so that we can use it on attacks on ANC members.\n\tIn the car were also two guns that Mr Cele had brought with him, it was one AK47 rifle and an Uzi submachine gun.  We went to the car, myself Dina Mkhize, Israel Hlungwane, Zwele Dlamini and Mr Cele as well as Victor Buthelezi.  We also had our own guns such as AK47 and G3 rifles.  \n\tWe had heard that there was a meeting that was to be held at Umsingwenya a higher primary school in J1 on the very same night.  It was an ANC meeting.  We drove to that place to attack the people who were going to be at that meeting.  We parked outside the gate as we were sitting in the car, two people approached from behind the car, approaching the car.  Dina then told Israel and Victor Buthelezi to alight and shoot these two people because they're going to disturb us.  They did so.  When these two people saw them approaching, they tried to flee, then Israel and Victor started shooting but I'm not certain whether these people were indeed hit or not.\n\tThey returned to the car but on their way a male person approached and this person was carrying books and he passed the car, he greeted us.  It appeared like this person was coming from the school as if the meeting was about to disperse.  After he had passed the car, just as he was about to meet Israel and Victor Buthelezi, Dina shouted through the window and said \"baas\".  As they met him, Israel and Victor shot at this person, I think they shot him twice and then they ran into the car.  \n\tAs they arrived, the car was just about to drive off, the engine was running.  As we passed the school gate, it seemed that the people in the meeting had heard gunshots and they realised that it was coming from this car, our car.  Some of them took cover behind the walls and they shot and we returned fire on our way.\n\tWe then went to B.B. Biela's house.  We took the Main Road between eSikhawini College and Umtokozwini bus stop.  We turned near the Umkabosa Bottle Store and we found a crowd of people waiting at the bus stop there.  We shot at those people and these people dispersed and we continued driving until we got to the Mayor's house.  We stayed for a short while at his house, thereafter we had to drive and take Mr Cele to his home.  We're took him to his house Langobo an area headed by Inkose Msemela.  We left him there and we returned with the guns that he had brought in the car.  The reason for this was that we were supposed to continue attacking that entire weekend until Monday morning so that Mr Cele will take the car and return it to the Chief Minister.  \n\tThe following evening...[intervention]",

After explaining this to Dina he told me that he had reported the matter to Captain Hlungwane and Captain Hlungwane had said that we should try and investigate so as to find out the reason.\n\tThe entire leadership of eSikhawini and of Ulundi as well as ourselves were concerned about this.  On following up information about Nati Gumede we discovered that although he was residing in Durban his home originally was at Langezwa.  This made us to seek out people from Langezwa and try to obtain information from them.  The used the IFP youth at Langezwa one of whom was under Andalatele.  Andalatele told us that he knew Nati Gumede and said that he was one of the ANC youth that they'd been fighting with at Langezwa such that he fled and went to Durban.  \n\tOne day we drove in Mr Mmambo's car who was at that time a principal at Eshowe, also an IFP leader at Eshowe.  It was myself Zulu Dlamini and Israel Hlungwane and with Mmambo and we drove to Nati Gumede's house.  On arrival we found two cars parked and these cars belonged to the ANC office at Empangeni.  We didn't do anything on this particular day.  On returning we discovered that it appeared as if Nati's sister worked at the ANC office at Empangeni.  Dina then passed this information to Ulundi, we discussed the developments around Nati's case with the IFP leadership at the local level.  I think that after a few days that information had been sent to Ulundi.  Israel came to my house on his way from work and he told me that a telephone call had come through and it had requested that Dina Mkhize and myself should go to the IFP office at Empangeni on the following day.  \n\tWhen we got there we found M.R.

We were hoping that he would bring the house number so that we could get there and once we were waiting, there came these four boys and they walked past the car, went into Paul and Gemma's shebeen.

At that moment he withdrew his AK47 and by which time I already had the pistol in my hand.

I did not hesitate that these other three were the ones with whom he was indeed working and the reason for that was that it was at night it was round about 1, 12, midnight. \n\tAt the time of the fighting at eSikhawini there would be no one you'd find walking after eight in the evening because it was not safe.  Those who walked around or travelled around during those hours were travelling in cars so that those who were walking on foot were the ones who were at war just like ourselves and thirdly they had guns, the two boys who were in their company.  Fourthly, honestly speaking, even though they did not have guns, I would not have spared them because if he was found at such a place in the company Umdanda at that time, that on it's own explains that he was an ANC member.

They were going to lead the march in their campaign to chase the ZP away from eSikhawini.  The eSikhawini leadership saw it necessary that the hit squad should be brought together so that ANC areas can be attacked.  ANC leaders and followers had to be attacked in their large numbers to frustrate them before the march.\n\tDina Mkhize was our Commander at eSikhawini but he was sick and he was at Dundee at the time.  Israel Hlungwane was at Umkuzi at our hit squad base at Umkuzi and therefore we were not complete and this IFP youth was brought together, Mandwengi and others and we went to Chief Zuza and we explained the situation that that very same night the ANC should be attacked and we should frustrate them so that their march should not be a success the following day.\n\tMrs Umbiasi then requested for ammunition from Chief Zuza.  Chief Zuza then sent a person, he just said the person should go to the kraal, dig and bring out the ammunition.  The person knew where the ammunition were in the kraal because he brought ammunition in a plastic bag.  They gave us bullets for a shotgun, about 25 SSG's and as we were discussing Zuza said he was going to convene a meeting to be held at his offices where we were supposed to discuss further the ANC because the ANC was beginning to problematic in his area as well and from then on we bade one another farewell and we went to Super Buthelezi's house also in Insingwene.

            "I feel very sad about what happened, what I did, what I did to the people of eSikhawini and the surroundings, to the relatives of those whose next of kin were hurt or injured or died.  I would like to say I am very sorry about what I did.  I also know that my apology cannot bring back those whom I killed but I am prepared to do whatever in my power to help them, to console them to try and heal their bleeding hearts.\n\tMy appearance before this Commission and my appearance before the other Commission last year and what I said in court in 1995, I said all this with very great regret.  It was not easy for me to come before this Commission because I know that by so doing I am placing my life in danger not only among the ANC members but also reference to the IFP members.  I have gone through a lot of intimidation and harassment because of the actions that I and my colleagues took, that was not done by the ANC members, but it was done by the IFP members together with their leaders because they were trying to stop us from coming here so that we could not divulge the truth and build reconciliation together with the ANC members, also the relatives of those next of kin died and suffered.\n\tWe are also sad and feel sorry that the media has a different story about the IFP but when we were together behind closed doors they will just indicate that we should just completely destroy the ANC.\n\tI would just like say something here, to indicate that IFP leaders were completely committed to destroying the ANC and this I know will place myself and my family in danger but I am not scared of death because it is better than dying than live on, it is better to die and live on than live with the kind of conscience that I have, a painful conscience full of people's blood.  You see, often times Chief Mangosuto Buthelezi would, if there was a squabble between IFP and ANC leaders, if he for example once said that AmaZulu would get tired or AmaZulu would retaliate.  I am telling you today that that was an instruction that was directly indicated to us that we had to get together quickly and hit or attack the ANC to make sure that he is the righteous lips that spoketh the truth and each time he said those words, you would remember how many people who died thereafter, not only at eSikhawini also in other areas and therefore it is very hurting that himself being a leader of people is a distant away from the truth because we are trying a reconciliation between the ANC and the IFP because people who suffered here are honestly innocent people.  They were protected by ourselves as leaders, the people who were not protected were the ones who suffered because of them.  I am not afraid, I am prepared to die for what I am saying only if it is the truth that I stand for so that my conscience is clear.  I am very sorry to every community member present here and those who were directly affected by my operations.  \n\tWe have tried, myself and colleagues, tried several things to build reconciliation with the ANC.  Dina has already explained that at Westville Prison, we have formed a reconciliation committee with the ANC members and this IFP Committee, all IFP members who were involved in the killing of people are involved are included here in this committee from places like Shawashabandi down to Natal Midlands up here in Northern Natal and the ANC is similarly represented because we have clearly indicated that we are now tired to be used by leaders and at the end they disown and deny knowledge of their activities.  I have been appointed chairman of this committee with my colleague Bononumbi who comes from Chief David Ndombela and within the ANC they have Supisi Sanbambo, leader of the ANC from Clermont and we also have Tom Mhlala a member of the ANC from the South Coast.  \n\tWe have introduced this to the IFP and presented it to the ANC as well.  The ANC was given Willis Ntunu who is Deputy Speaker for the KwaZulu Natal government, so that he is the one who works hand in hand and co-operate with us and the IFP issued Dingele who comes from Indedwe, also a Member of Parliament in the KwaZulu Natal Government and we also have Captain Hleng who is implicated in these statements together with Nicky Britz, they come from the IFP office.  We have come together and formulated a manifesto which we sent to the IFP and ANC offices with an intention that the leader should come to us so that we could address them as to what should be done.  Presently, the leaders of the two organisations have started collaborating from thence. \n\tI am trying to indicate how sorry we are about what we did and to show how much a distance we are prepared to travel to avoid a repeat of a similar situation in future.",

            "Yes that is correct.  That was not the end of it, we did not only expose what we did, we also went on to assist the eSikhawini community after our arrest.  The eSikhawini will also remember that there was a day when they were attacked on the day of The Line T.V. drama.  We had been arrested by then, we were no longer at eSikhawini but people who were continuing to operate were still at eSikhawini.  This T.V. drama, if I were explain so that those who don't know should understand, was explaining or discussing the dying of people and shooting of people in trains in Johannesburg and the characters were used as assassins in the drama, these characters spoke Isizulu and therefore in Johannesburg it was assumed that a person who spoke Isuzulu came from Natal and therefore he was Inkatha.  Many IFP leaders including Temba Kosa in Johannesburg spoke loudly and vociferously about this T.V. drama in the media in all sorts of community forums, explaining that this drama would anger AmaZulu so that they would be pushed into fighting because the kind of picture portrayed in the drama was such that AmaZulu are the ones who were killing people in the trains.  As I have explained that when it is said that AmaZulu would get angry and fight, that is actually a command.  Here at eSikhawini M.R. Mkhize of the Empangeni office and as well as the member of eSikhawini in J2 who is also a leader of the IFP at the time, Solo Dube, together with B.B. Biele the Mayor, they brought together Constable Umleje who was working at the eSikhawini Police Station as well as Jabulani Kanele from Port Danford who was working at the bakery and they gave them G3's, they then went to attack all houses in J1.\n\tAll houses that were watching television on that hour during which the drama was shown on television, that was\nactually a sign to the effect that what Temba Kosa from Johannesburg was saying was actually a word of instruction that would be carried out.  \n\tThat is not the end of it, I will also explain further as to how we knew that because we were incarcerated.  There were white police officers who were investigating the case for which we were arrested.  One of the them was Major van der Zwagen and Brigadier du Preez.  They booked the three of us out from the Pietermarizburg prison and they took us to a park where we braaied meat.  A combi from their unit also arrived.  In that combi was Jabulani Kanele, Jabulani Kanele he was a suspect.  Major van der Zwagen then told us that there was a person who was claiming to be one of our members and they were investigating him about the incidents of the night of \"The Line\".  We then got into the car and we asked Jabulani Kanele how things were going at eSikhawini.  Because he trusted us, because at the time nobody knew that we had now started working in collaboration with the I.T.U., he then told us the entire story.  We then told him to relax and that nothing was going to happen to him and then related this story to Major van der Zwagen and Major du Preez. \n\tThese two policemen were not investigating to arrest this guy but just to confirm if he was indeed one of our members and then they would release him because Major van der Zwagen and Major du Preez were then at the time working for Inkatha.  I have evidence of this which I can demonstrate.  They took Dina Mkhize saying that they are taking him to make statements to the Goldstone Commission.  He was kept in Pietermaritzburg at Townhill for the entire week, he made these statements and then they took these statements to M.Z. Khumalo in Ulundi.  I heard when I was asked by B.B. Biela as to why Dina was betraying them now.  When I asked how he knew about this he said Brigadier du Preez had taken Dina's statements to M.Z. Khumalo.  What I'm saying today can be attested to by several witnesses.  Captain Mazumkunu, Sergeant Masila and other policemen who worked within the I.T.U. with whom I was with when Biela told me this at his home.",
