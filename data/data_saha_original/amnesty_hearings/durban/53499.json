Your paragraph 6.14 speaks of Saul Mkhize, Khumbu Shangase, Sishe Madlala and the applicant as having been deployed to ambush the vehicle at the meeting of the 1st of March 1993.

Now we have no evidence whether this was taken back to the meeting and the meeting then confirmed that since you have volunteered you may proceed.

He wants to, and this is one of the reasons why he is here today, in the presence of the country, in the presence of the parents, publicly, not in secrecy, to profusely apologise for the incident, irrespective of what your Committee decides in this matter,  he also accepts that his remorse and regret will not bring back the children, but he is stretching his arms out and he's done that during our recess.  He says it was - this day he would never forget because during the recess he reached out to some of the parents and apologised to them.  He was not able to do it with all of them, but he intends doing it with each one of them.\n\tThe other very touching aspect that he shared with me just now, that he's really moved by, is that for the first time in approximately 6 years he spoke to his father and his father showed compassion to him and he feels that he can build the bridges between himself and his family now that the political scene has settled down.\n\tSo this has been more than just a moment of shedding the burden of this weight that he's carried for the past 6 years.  He has asked me to record that and he is grateful to the Commission for having created a structure of this nature where he could do it because he could never, he had the fear in him of retaliation, the fear of whatever else would have otherwise prevented him from having a day of this kind.  So I thought that was important and I need to record this.\n\tAs far as what I understand Section 21 requires in an application, I submit that my client has complied with the essential three legs of an application of this nature in that he has complied with the formalities and requirements of the Act in applying for amnesty.

He found that, in his Judgment, that there was in fact common cause that there was a conflict during the time of this incident between the IFP and the ANC.\n\tWhat also appears to be clear from the evidence of my client, is that he was a member of the ANC.

What appears to be the position as far as those reports are concerned is that there was continuous firing and the evidence is clear from my client that there was firing also on the canopy side of the vehicle.  I mean, he was standing on the side, they were firing all around, there were four of them.  We are looking at high calibre arms at a distance of approximately 20 paces.  We are also looking at people sitting on benches in a vehicle and you must remember that there are some people that would have had their backs facing, at the back of the vehicle, their backs facing the area from which the firing would have taken place.\n\tSo you may well have had, and there's no clear unequivocal evidence as to how those shots were fired, but it could well be and that is from the evidence of my client, it's my understanding of my client, that in that process they may have been shot from the canopy into their backs, resulting in rear penetration as was shown in the post mortem report.  I can't take that any further, I must concede that, I can't take that any further.  My client doesn't say -the one thing he's clear about and remember it took - his evidence which is uncontested, it took a minute or two, this was a spontaneous quick attack, in and out and that's how these attacks normally take place, with three automatic weapons firing at the same time, four automatic weapons. There's a hang of a noise, firstly, there's metal being hit continuously,  it happens for a minute of two and people are gone.  \n\tNow there is some - I believe that my client's version is probable in the sense that he didn't wait to see what happened.  One doesn't normally wait.   You know that the opposite party is normally armed, that you can expect anything to happen, be it from the vehicle or from the area, if you stand there and wait for a response.  They did what they had to, they believed they had in fact completed their task, and he said so in his evidence, which is uncontested, that they thought they actually hit Makeke, they didn't see him come off the vehicle.  That was never really taken any further, that he came off prior to them escaping or running away but it seems in his mind or their minds, particularly in my client's mind, they'd hit the target and they ran off.  They heard screams, but obviously they were running for their lives as well.  \tSo I believe that the version that has been put by my client, taking, and one must look at the circumstances objectively here, is a probable version, without doubt.  The question one must ask, and I think Chairperson, Members of the Committee must ask, would a person who is sitting safely in a comfort zone without any indications of coercion, come up here and give a version that is totally bizarre or absurd or not in line with the truth?  \n\tNow I'm just saying, there may be situations, you have more experience of them, but I am saying that I believe my client has played open cards and there may be factual discrepancies, I can concede that, there may be factual discrepancies, but if one looks at the evidence overall, the factual evidence overall both in the criminal trial and the evidence in the manner it was led, one must accept that his version is probable even having taken the evidence of the victims into account.

            "Yes, that's my point.  Thank you, thank you Honourable Member of the Committee.\n\tThe second point on disclosure is based on the fact that the applicant says when they fired shots at the vehicle they did not know that it was children that they were firing shots at.  I would argue that I find that improbable because when they fired shots, there must have been screams from the car indicating that it's children screaming.  Further, from the evidence of Mr Kuala, he even said that he himself tried to run away and some kids were shot outside the vehicle.  So I find it very improbable that the applicant did not know that it was school kids that they had fired shots at.  Also, because he seems to suggest that they knew Makeke very well to be driving a white bakkie and they have observed him quite a number of times, I find it very strange that in their observation of Mr Makeke, they wouldn't have known of a regular trip that always occurred in that route every morning, of a cream-white bakkie that used to take school kids from their homes to work.  I find that very hard to comprehend and I would argue that if they had time to observe Makeke, observe his ins and outs with the cream-white van, they should have known that it also, more especially because he indicates it was not Makeke's car, it did not belong to him.   He must have known that it's also used, if at all it was the same car, it's also used to carry or transport school kids to school.\n\tFurther, I think - I argue that the applicant should have or would have foreseen that if it's not Makeke's car, or if the car doesn't belong to Makeke, when they attacked they could have been attacking the owner of the car and not Makeke, or somebody else for that matter, as it occurred in this instance and therefore caution could have been - they should have foreseen, I think they would have known, they should have known that it could carry anybody, I mean somebody else, not necessarily Makeke.\n\tAlso I would like to address the Committee on the identity problem that my learned friend has argued on, the fact that it's so improbable that Mr Kuala could have seen Qeda Zulu.  I would argue that I don't find it improbable because if we could for a moment imagine what was happening there, there were shots fired, according to Mr Kuala, and then it became quiet.  So probably that's when the balaclava was taken off.   Because it was quiet, he might have thought that everybody that they have shot at has been killed and that's when maybe he decided to take off his balaclava.  I mean, we can never know what the reasons are, but I don't think it's improbable that that could have happened, considering that after they fired shots, it was quiet thereafter.  They might have assumed that everybody else was shot or was dead and it was safe to take the balaclava off.\n\tIf you could bear with me please.  On the issue of political motive, I would argue that, in the light of the fact that they could have foreseen that not only Makeke was driving the white bakkie but maybe the owner as well could drive the bakkie, they could have exercised more caution.  The applicant has stated clearly that he had no intention to kill the school children.  He also indicated that had he known that it was school children, he would not have fired those shots.  So basically this offence - he also admitted that the killing of school children was not associated with a political objective even though there might have been attacks that were made by the ANC before that.  This specific one was not associated with a political objective at all. \n\tThat is my argument Madam Chair, unless you want me to address you on a specific issue.",

Based on the information that the group of 20 had the night before, based on the information that everyone felt this cream-white vehicle was the vehicle that Makeke was seen driving in the area and the fact that he's transporting IFP people, based on an informed decision that they had taken, there was no talk that the owner was seen driving this vehicle, there was talk, and where this really came from one doesn't know because there was discussion around it before that decision was taken, that Makeke was the one that drives this cream-white vehicle.  They, on occasions, - but he was seen - the important thing is on one of the attacks he was seen driving that particular vehicle with members in it and it was seen in his mind and in the minds of that group as being the vehicle that Makeke normally drove and that was the vehicle that they had to ambush.  So he went with this particular picture in mind and armed with this information that, in his mind, and be it wrong, be it wrong, I'm not saying that it may be the correct impression,  be it wrong, but the impression in his mind clearly was that Makeke was the one that would be driving this cream-white vehicle and if we ambush it we're going to get Makeke, but it all went wrong completely.  It wasn't even Makeke.  It wasn't even IFP supporters that were sitting at the back, it was children.  But - in hindsight it was wrong, but if one looks at a situation and the subjective mind that was there in the applicant's,  in those circumstances, he was satisfied that he was now going to destroy Makeke.  In fact he said in his evidence that he believed that he now had shot and Makeke was there, nobody else, and that he had destroyed him and ran off.
