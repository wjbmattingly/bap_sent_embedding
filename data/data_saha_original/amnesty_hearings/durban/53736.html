<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">JOHANNES MNISI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mnisi, is it correct, you have made an application for amnesty and that your application appears at pages 97 to 102 of bundle A1?  The bundle is in front of you, if you can just check that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You have ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, before we proceed, Mr Berger, Mr Mnisi, are you also known as Mr Molefe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> My name is Johannes Mnisi, my MK name is Victor Molefe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you used you, in making the application you used your MK name, but you confirm that that's your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I used Johannes Mnisi.  If you can look on my statement at the end, just towards the end, I signed my real name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  I'm looking at page 97 Mr Berger, my document says Molefe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, Chairperson, what Mr Mnisi is referring to is, if you have a look at page 102, he has signed the application as J Mnisi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  No I was just clearing it up for record purposes, I'm not disputing that this is his application, but I just wanted to clear that confusion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So for the record Mr Mnisi, you confirm that the document from page 97 to 102 is indeed your application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, that's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You have also made a statement which has been handed in as Exhibit B3.  Do you confirm that that is your statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And in that statement, in paragraph 1, you say that your MK name was Vic or Victor and that you were also known as Johannes Molefe, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, your application for amnesty deals with a number of different operations.  You have already given evidence on another operation, the Voortrekkerhoogte operation, in another hearing, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> As well as the Pretoria Church Street car bomb.  Am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, you were a member of Special Operations from 1980 until 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Can you just tell us, what are you applying for amnesty for firstly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> In this hearing I participated in giving Mr McBride the material.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> For what?  That's why I'm asking, which offences are you applying for?  Or Mr Berger, maybe you can help us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Judge, for the purposes of this application, it's Mr Mnisi's interaction between himself and the unit operated by Mr McBride and Mr Webster and in particular the provision of material.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> What offence are we talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We're talking about a co-conspirator in the murder of certain people, attempted murder of other people, the delict of...</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> I'm just confining myself to offences.  You say murder and attempted murder.  Any particular murder you're talking about, or murders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well in particular, it would be the car bomb placed outside the Why Not Bar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> And attempted murders in respect of the same incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The same people, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Was that all?  Anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Judge, it doesn't appear that there are any more specific incidents as far as this hearing is concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Mr Berger, you put a question and I didn't catch the dates.  You said that he was a member of Special Operations from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> From 1980 until 1991.  Thank you Chair.  Is that correct, Mr Mnisi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The detail in paragraph 2 of your statement, how you moved from Mozambique to Zambia and how you travelled between Botswana and Zambia in the execution of your duties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Could you briefly elaborate for the Committee, what work you did during that period, particularly the work that you did in moving between Botswana and Zambia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> At first I was based at Mozambique.  I left Mozambique in 1984.  I went to Zambia.  This was after the Nkomati Accord.  I was working between Zambia and Botswana.  I was the co-ordinator, I was sending messages and other materials which were used.  I was transporting this between Zambia and Botswana.  We had people in Botswana, Tommy and Vusi.  I used to meet them there when I left Zambia.  The person who used to send me to Botswana was Rashid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Can I ask you just to speak a little louder and a little slower?  The person that you used to report to was Rashid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that would have been in Zambia, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that was until July/August 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> After that, comrade Rashid was promoted and then to whom did you report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Lester Dumakude, Kgatle ...(indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when you spoke about Vusi, who was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Vusi was someone who was working with Tommy in Botswana, he was also a comrade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's Mr Pule?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Pule.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How did you assist the comrades in Botswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I used to work with them when I was in Botswana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Doing what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Most of the time when I arrived there, I would find that people were there with them and I would meet these people and sometimes I would go there to give them money.  I would bring money to Botswana and sometimes I will arrange transportation for them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, when did you meet, if you can remember, comrade Robert or comrade Gordon for the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> comrade Gordon I met him in Zambia.  I don't remember which year, but he was the first person I met and comrade McBride, I met him later and also I can't remember the year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, there is an occasion that you refer to in paragraph 4 of Exhibit B3, when you assisted in packing certain materials into comrade Robert's vehicle.  What I want to ask you is, was that the first time that you had met comrade Robert, or had you met him prior to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> It wasn't the first time.  I don't remember how many times I met him before I met him there.  I think meeting him there was the last time.  The person who was supposed to work with Vusi, was Tommy and Tommy had been arrested at the time, therefore I was assisting Vusi to pack the material in comrade McBride's car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Before we get to that incident, on the previous occasions when you had met comrade Robert, had this been in Botswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And how had you assisted comrade Robert on those occasions, if at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Before I don't remember assisting him because the comrades who were in Botswana, used to assist him, that was Lester and Pule.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Alright.  And on this particular occasion, this is now in June of 1986, is it your evidence that you specifically assisted comrade Robert because comrade Chris, that's Mr Dumakude had been arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now what do you remember of this incident when you assisted comrade Robert?  Do you remember why you were assisting him or what you were assisting him with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I was in fact helping Pule to pack the material in comrade McBride's car because comrade McBride had a job to do inside the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who told you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> It was a known thing to us, we knew that if we give someone material, that person was supposed to come back to the country and do a certain job, even though we did not know what type of a job, but we knew that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who gave you the instructions to pack the material into comrade Robert's vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> As I've already indicated that the people who were responsible for this were two people, Lester and Pule, therefore Lester was no longer there since he was arrested, then I was just helping Pule so that McBride could drive back with the material, back to South Africa and the instruction came from Rashid that the comrades were going to be given the materials.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You then assisted in packing the material into the vehicle and then comrade Robert left, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Subsequently did you come to know about the operation that comrade Robert had carried out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Later, after the operation, in fact if I'm telling the truth, it was after he was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You heard that comrade Robert had been arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I think it was after a week, he had been arrested, I don't remember quite well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you hear why he had been arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> The information that I received was that it was the operation which he conducted on the 14th at the Why Not Bar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And also that it was a car bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Subsequent to that operation, you say you didn't see comrade Robert again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Berger.  Mr Dehal, do you have any questions you'd like to put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  May I have leave to confer with my client briefly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, I'm indebted to you.  Mr Mnisi, were there ever discussions between McBride, yourself and perhaps with Gordon Webster about ANC policies and guidelines?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I don't remember because this was Dumakude's job.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And were there any discussions in which you were involved with McBride and perhaps Pule as well, relating to targets in South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr Mnisi, would you regard yourself, at that time, as having been Mr McBride's senior in the structures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And I take it you'd agree that you're familiar with Mr McBride's application for amnesty, which has been discussed with you and you support it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I have no further questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DEHAL</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Dehal.  Ms Kooverjee, do you have any questions you'd like to put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MS KOOVERJEE:</span> None, thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Richard, do you have any questions you would like to put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Very few.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR RICHARD:</span> Mr McBride's legal representative put this question and correct me if I noted it wrongly, were there ever discussions regarding ANC policy and guidelines with Mr McBride and the reply I noted was</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>"I don't remember.  It was Lester Dumakude's job."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>Was that your answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, I'm saying I don't remember, but what I can remember is that we used to discuss things, but then I cannot be specific about what you want to get from me as to guidelines or whatsoever, but I do know that we used to discuss matters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  Now, on what basis did you believe that Mr McBride was under Mr Dumakude's command, or control, or accountable to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> These two comrades in Botswana, they were responsible strictly for those things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You say there were two comrades in Botswana responsible for those things.  My first question emanating from that, is what do you mean by those things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I'm referring to, they were receiving people who infiltrated Botswana, people who came from South Africa gong to Botswana, they would be received by Pule and Dumakude, those were the people who were giving them guidelines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, so it was, my next question was who were they?  So you say it was Mr Dumakude and Mr Pule.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now within the context of the time and in the situation in Botswana, would it be appropriate for somebody on the level of Mr McBride or Mr Webster, to report to persons above them, the two individuals you've just mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, they were reporting to them, but most of the reports were directed to Rashid, but some of them, they used to give to Pule and Dumakude, but the person whom they used to report to was Rashid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I realise that your involvement was very short lived.  Now when, at that time, ordnance, materials was given to an operative such as Mr McBride or Mr Webster, were they ever required to account for the use of their ordinance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Would you please repeat the last part of your questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Would they ever be required to explain what they used the equipment or materials they were given?  In other words report back on what happened to the weaponry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I don't think they were supposed to explain to us because it went this way.  The Commander will give instructions to them, therefore they will know what operations they are going to do.  There was no need for anyone to tell them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, I'm summarising it and I'm compressing the earlier part of your evidence.  From what you said, I understand and I'd like you to confirm it if I understand it correctly.  You had no idea what the materials being packed into Mr McBride's vehicle were going to be used for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, I didn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, what sort of vehicle did you pack them into?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I think it was an old Ford.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A sedan, a motor car, or was it a panel van or a bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> A bakkie, an old bakkie, Ford.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  Now was there anything particular about where weapons could be stored in that vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Would you please repeat, I can't hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think there's a problem with the equipment again.  Let's try again repeating, Mr Richard, and see if it's in fact an equipment problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was there anything particular about that vehicle into which you packed the weaponry as to where you could pack it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> There was a space where we could fit in the materials, it's just that I don't remember which side where we fitted but there was a place where we could hide it there, so that no one could see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So it was a concealed compartment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> How big was that compartment in length and breadth and depth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I cannot say exactly, but it was a much spacious compartment.  There was enough space for the material.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> It's difficult to guess, but do you recall what, difficult to remember, but do you recall what you packed into that compartment that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> What I can remember, I think there were extended charges and concentrated charges.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What are extended charges?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> These are bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What are they used for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> It depends on the person who is going to use them.  You can manufacture a car bomb, or you can place it somewhere.  It's almost the same as a limpet mine.  You can place it wherever you choose to place it, it's up to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Is it more or less powerful than a limpet mine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Extended charges are more powerful than limpet mines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What does the term "extended connotate" and mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I don't know how I can explain this, but it depends on the kilograms in that extended charge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And now you mentioned some other category of...</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Concentrated charges.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What are concentrated charges?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> The kilograms in the concentrated charges are smaller than the extended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And what are they used for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> You can still use them the same way, it depends on the type of the operation that you want to conduct, therefore you will manufacture it according to the operation.  It depends on the kilograms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Do you remember approximately, how many kilograms of such equipment was packed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> No I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Was it a lot or a little?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> No I don't remember exactly how many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, when you said you cannot remember exactly, but matters were discussed, what did you mean by you cannot remember exactly?  You cannot remember exactly when what matters were discussed, or you cannot remember what was discussed, which is it that you meant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> There were times when people came who came from South Africa.  We used to ask them about life in South Africa, that's why I said we used to discuss matters, I mean things, many thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now I gather then that there were discussions between you and either or both of Mr McBride or Mr Webster?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I used to discuss with Webster quite a long time because I used to be with him outside the country because he was also trained outside of South Africa, but McBride, I think our conversations were minimal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> The impression I get from your answer is that it was more generalities and matters of interest, it wasn't specific, in relation to operations or MK's affairs, that you had discussions about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Most of the time our conversation would be general.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Did you ever discuss any operations with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And you certainly didn't discuss any of the operations that either Mr Webster nor Mr McBride had carried out, or were about to carry out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I don't remember very well, but maybe when I met Webster in Lusaka, we talked about those operations, but I don't remember really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When would you have met Mr Webster in Lusaka?  After his escape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, after his escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, do you have any experience in the manufacture and the putting together of the car bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I trusted and I believed that any trained MK member can manufacturer a car bomb, because this is one of the things that you are trained with in our general courses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> If the equipment that you packed into that Ford was made into one car bomb, what sort of car bomb would it be, a small one, or a big one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> This depends on the operative himself.  If that person decides to make a car bomb, then it depends on him, solely on him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think the question put by Mr Richard was, if all the material that was packed into the vehicle, the Ford, was used in the manufacture of a car bomb, would that be a big car bomb or a small car bomb, can you say if that material was used, all of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> It can be a big car bomb, because extended charges have big kilograms and it also depends whether he has other material to add on top of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What sort of other material would you add on top?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I'm talking about material in other occasions when he used to go to Botswana and Dumakude and Vusi will give him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So you know that he was given other equipment as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The witness is talking about other occasions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, that's what I understood by it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Mr Mnisi, my question is very simple.  You helped pack the equipment into this particular Ford on that day and from your previous answer I gathered that you were aware that on other occasions in the past, Mr Webster or Mr McBride had received equipment, is my impression correct, that you were aware, that's all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And when you speak of adding material on top, you were saying that some of the other equipment that they had received on other occasions, could have been added to what they got from you that day?  Have I understood it right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I was trying to answer your question because you asked me that the charges which we gave Mr McBride, was he going to make a strong and powerful bomb, or a smaller one, now I answered your question by saying this was going to depend on him.  If he wanted to make a powerful bomb, he was going to do so, but if he wanted to make a less powerful bomb, he was going to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> As I understand you, Mr Mnisi, or let me ask you this.  The material you provided to him, was that sufficient for him to have built a powerful car bomb, on its own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, it was enough.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> And whether it was a powerful car bomb, or not so powerful, depended on what he himself decided to use and if he wanted to build a very powerful bomb, he could have, if he had other material, have used it in addition to what you provided for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you, Chair.  Now in the manufacture of a car bomb, was it taught that you could add things like nails or pieces of metal, or cut up reinforcing steel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I wasn't part of the people who trained him, therefore I don't know how far he was trained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> When you were trained to make car bombs, or trained others besides them, did you ever suggest to them that they could add that sort of stuff into a car bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> As I've already mentioned, that if one is a trained MK member, you are trained by so many things, including a car bomb.  You are trained by everything in manufacturing a car bomb, but at the end of the day it relies on the person who is making it, if you want to add on other pieces of metal, then you will.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So from your training you were taught that you could make the car bomb more effective by adding shrapnel, or pieces of metal into it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, the witness never said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think if you can just rephrase your question because he didn't say that he was taught that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Sorry.  Mr Mnisi was it ever the practice to teach person being trained that should they want to make a car bomb, they could add pieces of metal such as nails, cut up pieces of reinforcing rod and such-like, to the bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> When one is trained they show you haw to manufacture a bomb and how to place it.  As I've already answered before, I said it depends on the person whether you put nails and everything.  I don't know how he was trained, Mr McBride, therefore I don't know whether he was trained in putting nails or whatsoever, in the making or in the manufacturing of the car bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> My question was not whether Mr McBride was trained to put in additional pieces of shrapnel to a car bomb, my question is whether trainees were told and trained to put extra bits of shrapnel into car bombs, should they want to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I personally in my training, I don't remember anyone telling me to put nails in the manufacturing of the car bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> One last question on that point, if they did do that, what would be the purpose of doing that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> When one places a bomb in a certain place, that person has a reason for placing that bomb there.  At the time the situation was very bad, therefore putting a bomb, you had reason of why you're putting the bomb where you've put it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I'll leave that point.  Now from your evidence-in-chief, we heard that you did have some experience of car bombs and that you were and have given evidence in the Pretoria car bomb incident.  Now you have been present during Mr Ismail's evidence.  I'm not sure whether you were or you weren't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I'm not sure that Mr Mnisi said in his evidence-in-chief that he had experience of car bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, he didn't say he had experience, he mentioned that he had made application and had appeared in hearings involving inter alia the Pretoria car bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Were you the party to the construction of that bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, that is the subject matter of another hearing.  It's not relevant for the purposes of this hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the relevance of whether Mr Mnisi made another car bomb for this particular hearing, Mr Richard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> The relevance is that I'm about to go into his opinions as to whether the Parade Hotel was a legitimate or inappropriate target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you just ask him whether he knows about car bombs, rather than whether he took part in  building the Pretoria car bomb, or any other one, because then we're going to get into that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Well,  I'll leave the point, it doesn't take us ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because he did say that he was trained in making a car bomb.  I'll put the question this way.  Do you have any knowledge of the effects of the car bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, I do know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What are the effects of the car bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> If you've placed it in a building, it demolishes the building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And if you placed it in a crowded street, what would happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> If there's no building in that street, then it will just damage where you've placed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And if the street is crowded with people near the car bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> They will get injured if there are people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Will few or many people get injured if the street is crowded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Richard, I can assure you that we won't have to rely on the evidence of Mr Mnisi to be able to find that if a bomb goes off in a crowded place that many people might get injured.  I think you can accept that we would accept that a car bomb placed where there's a huge crowd of people, it's going to injure people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now from your experience of car bombs, if and I use the word if, a car bomb is placed on the corner of a street outside two pubs or restaurants which are busy, where lots of people are enjoying themselves, what would the consequences be?  But I believe the question has been dealt with by the Chair.  Would you have anything to add?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> As I've already said, it is obvious that people would get injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> ;   Now, in the ordinary course, from your training and experience, would two pubs with people in them and busy at the time, without anything else being said about it, be a legitimate target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So that means you are saying that it was in accordance with the African National Congress's policies and guidelines to place car bombs outside two crowded pubs, without knowing anything more about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> If you are trained, you know exactly where to place the bomb, you won't just put a bomb among innocent people, you will put it where you know and to the people you are fighting with, not just innocent people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, who would the people you would be fighting with be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Soldiers and police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now, if out of 100 people that would be affected, 10 or 5 were soldiers and police, would it be legitimate to put the bomb there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Mr Richard, can you just me something please?  If you get a different answer to what Mr Ismail has given to that same question, who are you going to ask us to believe?  Who are you going to argue is giving the proper answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Chair, the question put to me is if I get contradictory answers as to what is legitimate and inappropriate, what my argument would be.  It would be dependent on the answer.  If one says to kill one soldier it's legitimate to blow up 100 civilians or 10 civilians and another says to kill 50 soldiers it's legitimate to blow up 50 civilians, I will say very clearly that there was no clear policy at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> I would have thought that you got the answer already, if that's the line you're taking, proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can put the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> My question was, hypothetically, if there were two crowded restaurants in which there were 100 people and that being for the hypothesis a crowd, and of those 100, 5 were Security Force personnel, would that be a legitimate target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> In every operation where you go to participate, you do your reconnaissance therefore you know your target, you don't just go to kill innocent people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Is your answer to my question that in the case of the example I have outlined, that would be not a legitimate target and you would be killing innocent civilians?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, that wasn't the answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I said, is that the answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Well maybe we must allow him to answer the question instead of it being suggested to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> He did not answer my question and I'm asking him what his answer is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, he answered the question about 5 out of 100 being Security Force personnel.  The answer was in every operation you do your reconnaissance, therefore you know your target.  Now the question is, you can repeat it, Mr Richard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> In the example that I've outlined, if your reconnaissance reveals that there are 5 out of 100 and that's merely a hypothetical example, would that target be legitimate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> As I've already mentioned that before you conduct any operation you do your reconnaissance first to make sure that your target is there.  If you choose a place and you realise that your target is not there, then you won't go there, you only will go there when you know that that place is your target and you don't just do a reconnaissance for one day, you do for days to make sure, to be 100% sure that that's a legitimate target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> And if after making 100% sure by doing a thorough, detailed, careful reconnaissance, you find out that your target will consist of 5 out of 100 Security Force personnel, would you proceed or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> There I think it depends on the person who is going to participate in the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> So that means it would be up to the individual to decide whether to proceed or not, not up to an interpretation or the application of a policy or a guideline?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> You will follow the guidelines of the ANC.  First if you're trained, you know that you won't attack any place if it's not a target place.  It depends on the person who's going to take part, or who is going to participate in the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> What would the guidelines require you to do in the context that I've outlined, the hypothetical test case that I've put to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> It depends on the objective.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Now I don't understand what you say, on the objective.  You've said to me that it would not be permissible to bomb 100 civilians.  All I've changed now is that there are five Security Force personnel of no particular importance or rank, which is added into this proposition at this stage.  Would that now make it legitimate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Would you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> If I took 5 ordinary Security Force personnel of no particular importance into a place where there are 100 civilians, so that means we have now a 5% concentration of Security Force personnel, would that make bombing that place, or those two places, legitimate or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Why place 5 people among the innocent civilians, when you know you have enemies who are after you?  You put the 5 people among the innocent civilians because you want your enemy to be scared of attacking them.  You know you have an idea, why put those 5 people there?  It is because of you who sent the 5 people among the innocent people, it is you who are actually killing them or betraying them, the person who sent the 5 people to the 100 innocent people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Sir, you've changed the proposition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I thought I was following you, the way you're questioning me.  You told me that if you put 5 people among innocent 100 people, you ask me...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Let me go through it again before I push it harder.  You, as an experienced operative, who had been a member of the MK for many years, do a reconnaissance.  As a result of your reconnaissance, which you've done carefully, methodically and rechecked everything that you know, you discover a place where you are going to put a car bomb and from your intelligence gathering exercise, you know that there will be approximately 100 people in that place and I repeat, of that 100 people, which is a hypothetical figure as well, 5% of those might or are Security Force personnel, would you proceed to bomb that target with a car bomb?  It's you who is putting the car bomb, they don't know the car bomb is going to be there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> As I've already mentioned that in each and every operation you do your reconnaissance first, in order to identify a target that's what you do, that's the first step.  You try your level best not to injure civilians, that's why any soldier has to do a reconnaissance before the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> We're not getting anywhere, you're avoiding answering the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I thought I was answering you, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> You haven't given me an answer even though I believe you've understood the proposition as to whether you would go ahead with the operation or not in the example that I've given you, but now, I'll phrase it slightly differently.  On the hypothetical example that I've given you, and taking into account that you know all about the Kabwe decisions and resolutions and all the rest of it, would that hypothetical situation that I've outlined, when you apply the Kabwe tests and factors, constitute a legitimate target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, with respect...</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think it's the same question as before because...Are you saying, Mr Richard, in your first proposition when you said would 5% Security Force Personnel amongst 100 people be a legitimate target, now you've moved on, now you're saying, bringing in the Kabwe principles, you're asking exactly the same question, obviously by using the word legitimate target, you're incorporating the policies that existed at the time, including Kabwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And further, Chairperson, there is no Kabwe test.  Kabwe is just a decision taken by the ANC that now the struggle is going to be intensified and less regard is going to be paid to avoiding civilian injuries, that's what Kabwe decided.  No test.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I have here a situation where I think I've put a very, very simple proposition in very plain language to a very experienced operative and I haven't got an answer.  In fact the witness, in my submission, has declined to answer the question.  I think I'll leave it there on the basis that the only inference that can be drawn from the answers that we have received, is that it was not within the ANC's...</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think that's for argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> The witness has heard my proposition and I put it to you that I'm correct, that that would not have been a legitimate target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I don't know whether you want me to answer you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I would like you to give me either a yes or a no, nothing more complicated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> If a place is being frequented by your target, that place it's a target place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you.  So we now know that in accordance with your training and expertise and experience as an MK member of many years standing, you would have believed that to kill 95 civilians for the sake of 5 Security Force personnel, was legitimate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I don't know how to answer you.  If I may say it is so very easy for him to say what you're saying to me because you were not affected like I was in those days, we were in war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> It is the rules of war that we debate.  No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR RICHARD</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Prior, do you have any questions you'd like to ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chair, there are just two areas I'd like some clarification on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Mnisi, in response to one of Adv Sigodi's questions, Mr Pule, well first the question was, how, as Command structure, were you able to ensure that the guidelines were carried out and that the material supplied was used for legitimate purposes, in other words a legitimate target destruction and so forth and in summary the answer was really there was no way to ensure that it could be done, but the best in the circumstances was to keep reminding the operatives who were going out of Botswana back into the Republic, was to keep reminding them of the political objectives, that there operation should fall within the guidelines set out by the MK Command, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And I just want your response to what he added to that.  He said because of the situation in the Republic, or in the country, where the government of the day and he used the word Boers, the type of atrocities that they were committing, he indicated that there was the possibility or there was some indication that the operatives going back could have, for example, placed a limpet mine in a creche and the impression that I gained from Mr Pule is that they didn't want that to happen, so in order to maybe calm things down, they impressed on the operative to operate within the guidelines.  Can you comment on that response of Mr Pule from your own perspective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, people were taught and they were reminded by the guidelines of the ANC and they were told that they mustn't go and do as they pleased, they must do exactly as the guidelines required of them and yes, some people were angry but they were taught and they were told to follow the guidelines of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did it sometimes appear to you in Botswana that the operatives moving back into the country may have been motivated by feelings of anger towards the situation in the country?  In other words, there was a desire to take revenge on one or other group within the country, as a result of what was happening in the country at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> All the cadres who were coming to South Africa, they were briefed first, they were not allowed to do as they pleased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> It's not quite an answer.  For example, in your inter-relationship with Mr McBride at the time when you were packing these explosives in his vehicle, did you gain the impression that he was particularly angry at the situation in South Africa, the emergency, the various attacks by Security Forces on black civilian populations and so forth, or did you not get that impression?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> No I didn't get that impression with Mr McBride because what I realised is that he knew, he was briefed and I think even today he knows the guidelines of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes, one last matter.  Your amnesty application, the application form 1, did someone assist you with that form, in other words to complete the form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This is the form that appears on page 97 et seq.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did someone assist you to fill in the form?  Was it a colleague, or was it an attorney or somebody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I think my lawyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I just want to refer to page 99, paragraph 4 under the heading Car Bomb Blast - Why Not, Magoo's Bar.  If I may Mr Chairman, just read out the brief description and I'll come to the question.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>"I was involved in the preparation of materials for the car bomb later used in the bombing of Why Not Magoo's Bar on June 14th 1986.  I assisted in the procurement of the materials and with the packing of the vehicle, which transported the materials into the country from Botswana."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>Do you confirm what is there in your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> When I filled the application form, I was told already that that material that I packed in McBride's car was the one which was used for that bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I was coming to that because there just appears to be a contradiction from the statement B3 that you tendered today.  Are you saying that that information was supplied to you by your attorney, that's after the fact, in other words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> There on the other statement, I didn't know, but when I filled in this one, then I had already been told.  On the other one I didn't put it because I didn't know, but then when I filled the other statement, I had already been told.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> There's not trap or trick, I just want to clarify it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But Chairperson, with respect, this statement doesn't say that Mr Mnisi knew at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I think it creates - it might be ambiguous, I think he's just clearing it up, I think it's quite clear from what Mr Mnisi has said that what's contained in the application form that the material that he packed was used in the operation, he learned after the event.  Is that correct, Mr Mnisi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes, I needed to clarify that.  Thank you Mr Chairman, I have no other matters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Berger, do you have any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Just very briefly, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mnisi, is it correct that when you packed the explosives into comrade Robert's vehicle, you knew that that material could be used to manufacture a car bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No further questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BERGER</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Berger.  Adv Sigodi, did you have any questions you'd like to put to Mr Mnisi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Just one aspect, to clarify.  How many training camps were there in Botswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> We didn't have camps in Botswana, we used residential places.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> But I mean groups for training.  How many people were responsible for training people in the making of car bombs in Botswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> I wouldn't know about other units, but in our unit it was Vusi and Dumakude.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Were there many units that perhaps you didn't know of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> Yes, when I'm saying units, I'm talking about other departments, there were others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> No, I'm referring to, in particular, to units where people would be trained in the making of car bombs.  Do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Was it possible to know each and every unit that was in existence in Botswana and/or Lusaka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> No, I will only know people who were in the Special Operations, the others I wouldn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> The reason I'm asking you this is because you were asked about whether in the training of people in the making of car bombs, you knew if people would be taught to put in shrapnel and nails into car bombs, is it possible that there was a unit that would teach people to make car bombs in this was, or is that something out of your knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNISI:</span> No, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Judge Pillay, do you have any questions you'd like to ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Mnisi, sorry - are there any questions arising out of questions put by Adv Sigodi?  Any questions arising?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> None Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Mnisi, that concludes your testimony, you may stand down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, the next witness is Mr Lester Dumakude.</p>
