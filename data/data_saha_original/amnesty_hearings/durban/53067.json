This man is a policeman, just came into the cell and called out names from the list, and my name was also on the list.\n\tWe went downstairs where we were required.  On arrival, I found a lot of other people there.  A certain gentleman in a suit came.  It was a white person and other people who were with him, African people.\n\tThey talked to us one by one.  They also called me.  I was asked for my name.  They also asked where I was employed before and I told them.  This person told me that he was an attorney and he wanted information about what happened at the trial so that he would go to Pretoria and seek amnesty on my behalf.\n\tI asked him about this because I had not requested an attorney.  I then told him that I do not know who he is or where he comes from, but if he is willing to act for me to seek amnesty, I can explain what happened, or how I got involved.\n\tHe asked me a few questions which I cannot remember, and thereafter he dismissed me.  I then left, that was the only time that I spoke to him and I never saw him again.\n\tI did not really find this strange, because in prison, you are normally called sometimes and do whatever you are required to do.  I think that maybe that is how this statement came about.  That was the time that I saw this person.\n\tI never heard anything from him again.  I did not worry because I had not actually requested any assistance from an attorney.  That is how I think that statement came about.  It is not easy for me to say that I do not know or that I do know.  I am just speculating on how it came about, but I was not aware of its existence.",
