You will recall we said that we requested Heads and two sets have been provided here and then said that any legal representative, should he or she so desire, can emphasise points and make oral submissions.

To argue it as a matter of pure law, in my submission would be artificial.   At page 2 of my Heads, onwards to page 7 I have outlined certain facts.   One of the things to stress in that narration, is that the document which we referred to as Annexure C is the product of a Section 29 investigation at which Mr McBride was legally represented by Mr Brian Currin and in which as is outlined in page - for give me, gone too fast - page 5 referred to in the Section 29 hearing.

Then this hearing took place a few days later, on the 21st of that month.

Subparagraph (c) it would seem follows from subparagraph (a), but in truth is not an objection in principle raised by myself, relative to the applicants represented by Ms Kooverjee and I, but indeed by Mr Berger, relative to Mr Ismail when he then testified.  It is not really a point I am taking, I simply supported Mr Berger.  In so far as subparagraph (b) is concerned, the terminology is incorrect, the inference therefore is incorrect.  I do not nor do my clients decline to provide the victims' legal representative with anything in that regard, I do not have any copies.  In fact when you, Mr Chairperson, enquired from my appropriately what might the word application refer to if it does not refer to the evidence of Mr McBride in the 29 hearing, I endeavoured to suggest what it may possibly refer to.  I do not have those documents.  Mr Brian Currin represented Mr McBride, I telephoned Mr Currin, I sought to have his files sent to me, but he indicated after careful search that the files he did find, would be of no use to me.

            "Mr Chairperson, perhaps I should come in at this stage, just two aspects.\n\tMy learned colleague, Mr Prior, referred to Mr Currin and the quotation from me that he does not have anything further in his file.  Mr Currin does not practice as he used to before, he practices from his residential premises, his files are somewhat in a disarray and that is the impression that I got from him.  He searched through his archives, obtained a few files and said that those would not assist me in these proceedings.   Mr McBride recollects specifically, when assisted by Mr Currin during the Section 29 proceedings, that an application was handed in and indeed that is referred to on page, or rather is more fully dealt with on pages 3, 4 and 5 of bundle C, some of the aspects I have quoted in my Heads, but particularly Mr Chairperson, if I may take you to paragraph 3, that the top of it is an address by Mr Currin which begins at the bottom of page 2 wherein Mr Currin says -\n\"... thank you very much, one doesn't  - \tI certainly haven't had a long history of appearance before this Committee, so I am not quite sure what the procedures are.  What we have which I will in a moment hand you back to Mr McBride (and this is relevant) is a document which contains detailed information with regard to the Magoo's bombing (and then much later, at the very end of that, I think at about lines 16, 17 the words) and it is also  the, this will be part of his application, verbatim part of his application which we will lodge to the Amnesty Committee at a later stage.\"\n\tMr Chairperson, I may just say that this document was subsequently affirmed under oath by Mr McBride when his evidence began and then on page 4 from lines 11, 12 onwards, the Chairman says the following -\n\"... I can assure you  that the information obtained at Section 29 hearings, are absolutely confidential, people are here sworn to secrecy.\"\n\tAnd then Mr Govender below that says -\n\"... just one concern Mr Chairman, my learned friend referred to a statement that he is going to hand over to the Commission.  Just to get clarity from my learned friend whether this is an amnesty application or a statement in response to the information that we require in terms of our subpoena.  Perhaps he can clarify that for us.\"\n\tMr Currin's response in that regard is appropriate, he says the following -\n\"... it is an amnesty application which deals specifically with the incident which is referred to in the subpoena.  In the amnesty application details are given with regard to that particular incident and the details which are given in our view, deal with the sort of information that we anticipate that this, your team, would require.\"\n\tAnd then the next excerpt is very appropriate -\n\"... and the purpose of handing in this particular application is because Mr McBride would prefer if possible, to make one statement to the TRC.  He would prefer not for the TRC to have more than one statement dealing with this particular matter for reasons of evidence and procedure when his application is heard.\"\n\tAnd then in the next sentence again he refers to application, wherein he says -\n\"... once you have looked at the affidavit, once you have looked at the application which he is willing obviously to swear to the contents of it, to the extent to which it relates to his personal knowledge, you can then decide whether you want further information.\"\n\tAnd then Mr Chairperson, much later, Mr McBride - sorry the Chairman on page 7 from line 7 deals with it as follows -\n\"... Mr McBride (he says), Mr McBride and Mr Currin, the document you are going to be handing up, is in essence an extract from a broader amnesty application.  Does it contain any supporting documentation or extracts from other supporting documents as well?\n\tMr Currin -\n\"... yes.\"\n\tThen the Chairman says -\n\"... okay, well then perhaps Mr McBride you are under oath already, do you confirm that this document that you are about to hand up is to the best of your knowledge and belief true and correct?  Yes, I affirm that\" ... (says McBride).\n\tNow three things, one it is the application for amnesty that appears to be a document referred to as the application in some respects, as the document in other respects and as the affidavit in other respects, but I understand in consultation with Mr McBride and this would come off in his evidence when he does testify,  that this application which was handed in by Mr Currin, was not strictly speaking the application for amnesty that we have in bundle A, pages 103 onwards, but an application which was supported by annexures thereto, so as to more fully explain aspects, and those annexures you would see Mr Chairperson, are referred to on page 7 of this bundle C, when the Chairman deals with those supporting documentation and extracts, on line 10, 11 and 12.  The words \"does it contain any supporting documentation or perhaps from other supporting documents as well\" and the answer is \"yes.\"  I do not have, nor did I ever have the benefit of seeing that  complete document referred to therein, the annexures thereto, any supporting extracts, etc.  I therefore am somewhat at a loss as to what document they are referring to, but crisply the point is whatever the document is, it is that very document handed in by Mr Currin  to the Section 29 Amnesty Commission which is referred to in Mr McBride's amnesty application, to be included herein by reference principally, crisply, one-pointedly for the purpose of including a list of the names of the injured and deceased persons per se.

            "Mr  Chairperson, unfortunately I would not be able to help, in as much as I would like to, but may I just confine my address in regard to that application and the supporting documents crisply to this aspect.  Sorry it would appear firstly that reference to Mr McBride's application for amnesty and the reference therein to any aspect of the Section 29 proceedings, is an aspect which is sought to rely upon in an endeavour to have the evidence included.  My Heads and indeed my earlier submissions, I reiterate are the following briefly, one, one must understand that the word used there is application and not evidence.  I see Mr Prior's Heads of Argument incorrectly refers to it as \"the evidence\", but I think Mr Prior would deal with that.  His pages are not numbered, but in paragraph 7.3 he talks of evidence, he says\n\"... the applicant refers in his amnesty application to his evidence at the Section 29 proceedings.\"\n\tNow therein on a misunderstanding of the semantics of the ...(indistinct) lies the problem we are facing today.  Mr McBride does not refer to his evidence, he refers to the application.  And we have now, I think more than clearly established that the application Mr McBride refers to, is the papers or are the papers, he handed in through Mr Currin to the Section 29 Commission, which papers unfortunately none of us have, but which I submit are papers referred to in Mr McBride's amnesty application, purely to obviate the need, to retype, to reprint the 72 names of injured and deceased persons.  There is merit in the reason for him to simply refer to it by reference, rather than retyping it.   Obviously to save time, number of pages, etc, and the boredom thereof.  \n\tNow therein lies in my view, crisply the summation of that anomaly or ambiguity.  In my Heads I deal with two additional points, firstly that the evidence Mr McBride tendered at the 29 hearings, in itself do not in any way include a list of the names of the injured and deceased persons, so it cannot be contended by any party that by reference to that, sorry to the 29 proceedings or any document therein, that for the intention that Mr McBride had to include the list of names of the deceased and injured, he could possibly have referred to the evidence.  No, that couldn't possibly be so.  \n\tAnd secondly that the application handed in wherein reference is made to the Section 29 documents, was handed in on the 10th of April.  The evidence was heard on the 21st of April, much later.  It cannot be said therefore that the evidence was intended to be included, because the evidence was not even heard at the time.

            "Chair, may I proceed.  My first point is that between the 21st of April 1997 and the 14th of June 1986, number one the applicant was an accused in a very lengthy, hard and well fought trial and other trials had happened.  Mr Derrick McBride, his father, and Mr Lecordier, Mr Gordon Webster and in those proceedings much evidence was led.  The second point is whatever this document or statement or application is, or was, it was confirmed by him under oath in response to the questions put to him at the Section 29 enquiry.  The third point is what is now clearly common cause is that his applications for amnesty and the matters dealt with at the Section 29 enquiry, are the same.  In other words the Parade Hotel incident.  In other words he has given evidence on oath in relation to those incidents.  Then I have no difficulty in the circumstances, that as at April the year before last, the fifth applicant was able to make the statement during the car bomb operation at the Why Not bar, three people were killed and 69 injured.  He made that under oath.  It is an admission which he is bound by and which he cannot withdraw.  It is an admission of fact.  He goes on to say\n\"... those who were killed, were Marchelle Gerrand, Angelique Pattendon and Julie van der Linde.\"\n\tThey are names that must have been bandied about the court rooms at length.  And then he proceeds to say -\n\"... for the list of those injured, refer to the trial record and charge sheet.\"\n\tAnd then adds on as an afterthought, but it is a particularly relevant afterthought -\n\" ... further details are contained in the application handed into the Commission in Durban at S29 hearing.\"\n\tI believe that the only consistent inference to be drawn from that parenthesised add-on is that  what he is referring to is the overall picture, not something relating to some minor aspect.  Now, where it takes this argument is that what is set out in Exhibit C and all the matters arising there from, are common cause with this current hearing, parallel thereto and intertwined and my submission is irretrievably so and it is impossible to separate the two.   I then turn to the questions of law.   At page 8, at paragraph 3, I deal with the first issue.  What is the nature of the information contained  in Exhibit C?  Now, Section 29 has a particular word in it, that which is furnished.  Now I have gone at length at pages 8 and 9 to detail how this hearing is a hearing in terms of the Act which is governed by the provisions of Chapter 6.  Exhibit C has been furnished in the plain English meaning of being provided firstly to the Committee, secondly to me and thirdly that if one embarks on a careful analysis of Section 29(5), that Section and I would then proceed to refer to an appendice to my Heads of Argument, the last page thereof, the power, the authority of the Commission to prohibit the making public of the information emanating from a Section 29 investigation ends when the document, information, article has been and I will use the word provided as opposed to furnished, at a hearing that at has historically now happened.  It is a past fact.  Whatever power the Commission might have had prior to the furnishing or providing of Exhibit C and everything emanating from it, is now at an end.  It is a public document which as I have outlined in the document before us, my Heads of Argument, which now falls in the public domain.  There is no restriction on any one picking it up from the table here and taking it and publishing it.",

It enjoins the Commission to have regard to the principles of openness and transparency.  At page 16, paragraph 3.3.6, I stopped my research after looking up what the meaning of the two words \"openness and transparency\" were and I have outlined.  Transparent means having the property of transmitting light so as to render what is laying beyond, completely visible.  That can be seen through, open, exposed to general view or knowledge and the meaning of the words is so plain, argument will take it no further.  \n\tI then revert to the fact that we are in a situation where the applicant has had the and I must concede the trauma and experience of giving evidence firstly at a lengthy trial, then at attending to the sequels of appeals and so on, then at a Section 29 investigation and now faces being questioned in these proceedings.   In this regard I must point out that if one examines the version put up at the trial, and compares it with the version put up by the first applicant, Mr Aboobaker Ismail, and the as yet unknown version of the fifth applicant, it would fly in the face of every notion of openness and transparency if it were said that it was prohibited that any one of all these versions and everything emanating from them all, including the warning and interrogation statements, were precluded from the gamut of cross-examination.  It would mean that the fifth applicant would be entitled in some manner or other, to not be called upon to explain inconsistencies, contradictions and in fact would lay the way open and I am not submitting that that is necessarily the case in this matter, because we haven't yet gone there and for me to say it, would be premature, to chose, to sensor a version so as to chose the most favourable which certainly is not consistent with transparency and openness.   \n\tNow, so to revert to the argument that the document falls as a public document, I ask the question how could any person exercising the discretion, not to allow the document and its information to remain public, justify a decision to make it secret?

            "Yes Chair, there are factual situations which one can hypothesise and theorise, public interest, State security and very special exceptions, but in relation to this particular incident which arose 13 years ago, there is no factual basis for any such submission.   Then parallel to that we have the debate relating to full disclosure.  Again to go through it quickly and I don't intend labouring the point, I believe our learned Deputy President of the Constitutional Court set it out far better than I will ever do it, in the case of Azanian People's Organisation Azapo & Others v The President of South African & Others, I have referred to the case at page 12, paragraph 3.2.2.4 and I have set out the quotes therein, particularly the second quote lower down on the page and continuing on to page 13.  There the learned Judge emphasised the utmost importance and quintessential essence of an amnesty application, that the victims are entitled to ascertain the truth and to know the truth and the applicant is under a duty to disclose the truth and make full disclosure.  I then allude to the object of the Commission at paragraph 3.2.2.1, I refer to paragraph 1(a)\n\"... by establishing as complete a picture as possible of the cause, nature and extent of gross violation of human rights.\"\n\tAnd then paragraph (b) more importantly -\n\"... the object of the Commission shall be to promote national unity and reconciliation in a spirit of understanding which transcends the conflicts and divisions of the past by facilitating the granting of amnesty to persons who make full disclosure of all the relevant facts relating to acts associated ...\"\n\tNow, if one relates that back to the discretion I have outlined in terms of Section 29(5), again, there is only one defensible and justifiable decision that could be made as to what to do with a document and the information emanating from it, like Exhibit C, and my submission is that there certainly could have been no irregularity or mis-application of mind in making a decision not to do anything to declare it a document which shall not be made public.   \n\tNow, then we revert to some more what I call semantic arguments and there I refer to paragraph 3.4.2 of my Heads at page 17.  Section 31(3) of the Act, that is the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, contains a section which is interesting from a point of view from interpretation.  In that subsection there is a phrase which I have emphasised by highlighting it - \"shall not be admissible as evidence against the person concerned.\"  Now, the word concerned creates a semantic convolution which can only be resolved by returning to (1) of Section 31, where the Section compels any person who is questioned by the Commission in the exercise of its powers in terms of this Act, or who has been subpoenaed to give evidence, to procure, etc.  \n\tNow, we then turn back to (3) and there before the tortuous phrase, derived from a questioning in terms of (1), my submission in that regard is that the only proper meaning that might be given to the phrase \"against the person concerned\" is that that person is the person who in terms of (1), was compelled to produce or to answer questions or to provide information.   The next question is what does the Section relate to?  Any incriminating answer or information obtained or incriminating evidence directly or indirectly derived - now that evidence shall not be admissible in criminal proceedings in a court of law, or before any body or institution established by or under any law.   \n\tNow, in the nature of things, any applicant before this Amnesty Committee is required to give particulars of an act or omission which constitutes a crime or a delict within the rest of the requirements.  Now, the mere making of an application for amnesty is an incriminating act.  That fact in my submission means that an Amnesty Committee is not what was intended when ...(intervention)",

In all the other Sections that I quoted earlier, there is no mention of the word \"privilege\".   When one considers Section 31(4), it is the first time that the notion is introduced, there is no provision in any of the other Sections creating any legal notion of privilege.  It may create situations where a person might be compelled to give incriminating evidence, protect the person, remove the protection if a person does not, and so on.  To ascertain what this Section means, my first consideration is what type of privilege is under discussion and I came to the conclusion that only two could be in point, and that is the standard common law of the privilege or now known as the right not to answer incriminating questions, and the right of privilege pertaining to communications between legal advisor and client.  On reflection, I then understood the policy reason why this subsection was enacted.   Firstly, I think it would have been an unjustifiable limitation of the rights of a client to abolish practitioner/client privilege.  The Act does that in clear unambiguous terms.  Then when one refers to the Section, the last number of words of the Section say\n\"... the law regarding privilege as applicable to a witness summoned to give evidence in a criminal case in a court of law, shall apply in relation to the questioning of a person in terms of (1).\"\n\tSo, subject to (1) and subject to the limitations and the right not to incriminate, provided (1) has been complied with, incriminating questions which breach the privilege against self-incrimination are permissible, provided the subsection has been complied with.

He has no rights of such privilege.

Mr Chairman, the preamble to the Promotional of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, I submit lays or indicates the wide scope  that this Committee has in particular, in dealing with amnesty applications in respect of receipt of information.\n\tIn terms of the Commission's work as a whole in investigating gross violations of human rights, the establishment of as complete a picture as possible, of the nature, causes and extent of those violations, is required.  Mr Chairman, it is apt to highlight the fact that the powers conferred upon this particular Committee on amnesty in terms of Section 5 of the Act, allows or allow the Amnesty Committee to set out working procedures and from there, develop practises as to how it would conduct its business.  To that extent, the office or the position of Evidence Leader was not lightly determined.  In fact the support of such a person or office forms an integral part of the work of the Amnesty Committee.  A practice has developed since its inception, that information would be prepared, would be collated and presented to an Amnesty Committee specifically dealing with a particular amnesty application.   To that extent my submission is that the legislature had in its mind, at the time when it drafted or when it pronounced on Section 29, that very situation.   \n\tMy reading of Section 29(5) in particular, I submit, caters for two distinct situations.   The one situation is where the Commission having regard to the principles of openness and transparency may declare such Section 29 evidence, not to be made public as was argued by my learned friend, and as correctly pointed out by the Chairman.  If or in the absence of such determination, that determination being that the evidence or the proceedings should not be made public, if that does not happen, the Act says until the article is produced at a hearing, which is an amnesty hearing in point, and then I don't refer to proceedings in courts of law, they are two disjunctive situations, it is not and or, it is not a condition that the Commission needs to pronounce upon .",

I would submit in any event, there is a far wider interest which is catered for by the Act in respect of the first proposition that having regard to those principles of openness and transparency, this Committee ought to allow it in any event.\n\tFinally, we are indebted to both legal representatives of the victims and of the applicant, the fifth applicant, both their Heads of Argument are very helpful, however, if I may just briefly refer to paragraph 1 of Mr Dehal's Heads.  With submission, all three points that he makes, being the basis of the objection to the inclusion, I submit are without any real substance.

Paragraph (b), he submits that by agreement at the 29 enquiry on the 21st of April 1996, the evidence is protected.  With respect, there is nothing from the preamble or the prelude to those proceedings.  If one gleans from the record, there was never any agreement struck between the Commission and the fifth applicant to that effect, and with submission, even if that was so, such agreement in the language or in the intention of the Section, would not have been proper, it would have been void.  It would not have been a binding agreement, because the Act does not allow for such an agreement to be struck.   \n\tAnd thirdly, subparagraph (c), I submit has been adequately canvassed by Mr Richard on behalf of the victims that privilege does not exist in the sense in which it was argued, and certainly I would also go along with Judge Pillay's reference to privilege if in the broader sense, it has a particular meaning in so far as such evidence would not be allowed to be used in proceedings where there was a penal sanction or the possibility of a penal sanction.  I would submit it would only be appropriate in that limited instance.  Those are my submissions, thank you Mr Chairman.",

The enquiry relative to privilege is a very much wider one, it is a factual and legal enquiry, and does have devastating consequences inasmuch as this Commission does not have any powers to impose penal sanctions.  Let's look at the very real possibility of the corollary that if this Commission decides to refuse amnesty, then the document that is the evidence in the Section 29 proceedings, by its very inclusion in these papers, is a public document and within the realms of public domain, and may well be used in most any civil and criminal proceedings, not even those in criminal proceedings in a court of law.",

My submission is that both my learned colleagues referred to full disclosure and that in the spirit of full disclosure, the evidence in the Section 29 hearings, ought to be included.   I submit respectfully that the enquiry is wider than that, and the enquiry relative to full disclosure is premature at this stage, that indeed Mr McBride does intend to testify in these matters.  Perhaps once he has testified, the submissions, the enquiry, the question as to full disclosure will then be appropriate.\n\tAt this stage the criticism relative to full disclosure, premised purely on the argument on the Section 29 evidence, is in my respectful submission, inappropriate.  For that reason the reference to the case of Azapo v The President, is in my respectful submission, irrelevant.  That case does correctly set out the necessary principles in law and generally on the spirit of this Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation, the need for full disclosure, I agree with all of that, but again I submit, that enquiry becomes appropriate at the end, when Mr McBride has testified, not at this stage.  \n\tAs regards Section 29(5), Mr Chairperson, I am not absolutely certain of this, but in my discussion with senior legal personnel, dealing with (5) and the reliance now sought to be placed there on for the purposes of including this evidence, it seems to me clear that Section 29(5) by the very nature of the fact that it is (5) to Section 29, falls squarely within the purview of Section 29 which is Section 29 that deals with an enquiry on these proceedings, and it is Section 29 that caused bundle C to come about and that (5) perhaps is irrelevant for the purposes of the present enquiry and the term Commission in (5), refers to the Commission that heard the evidence in the enquiry and not the Commission presently dealing with this.",

If one imagines the results that would flow if this Commission could not sanction\npeople who lie to it and commit perjury in its face, it is ...(indistinct), the extension of the interpretation, I go back to what I have said earlier - somebody commits an act, is tried for it, during the course of his defence, lies, but he is not believed and convicted, and then comes out with the truth.  I took it as part of, it is not legally correct, but ...(indistinct).  \n\tThen when we talk about the debate of the furnishing or providing of Exhibit C, well, none of us in the room were responsible therefore, it would have been useful if some rules had been written some years ago, none were, I think what our learned colleague Mr Prior, said, practices and procedures have evolved.   My post-script to my point in limine, point in limine, I don't take it any further.  Then when one talks about onus and that topic, I have often questioned what is the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and I came to the conclusion that it is sui generis, it is neither an administrative tribunal in that sense, or body, nor a court of law.   It certainly is charged with a duty as (20) outlines, to investigate amongst other Sections, consider, decide, but on what criteria?  The word \"its satisfaction\" often comes up, I have cross-referred.   Clearly because it has powers of investigation as is set out in chapter 6, its power to obtain information, articles, and so on, that are relevant, cogent, pertinent, are considerably higher and more effective than any court of law or other ordinary administrative, so at the end of the day, I don't believe there is much purpose in pushing the point of onus.  It is really relevance, cogency and what in the end, is aimed at facilitating the outing of the truth.  The agreement, I wasn't a party to that agreement, I wasn't there and I don't believe the victim class were even present or represented at the Section 29 hearing.  An inference I draw that this supposed agreement that was arrived at, was really an agreement, might in fact and I take it no further than the word \"might\" an understanding as to what the law was.  An admission of what the law is, has never bound anyone.  The law is plain, what we have argued this morning is the law, and what was agreed, takes us no further.

We don't have that situation here.  And just lastly, I don't think we can ignore the comments and the judgment of His Lordship, Mr Justice Mohammed in that AZAPO case.  He goes right to the root of it, the trade-off in plain, blunt language is full disclosure, truthful full disclosure.  If the victims cannot learn what the truth was, what happened, that is the essence of what these proceedings are all about.  We cannot be seen to be subverting any information which may assist this Committee in determining what the truth is, or the victims hearing what the truth was, in fact.  Thank you Mr Chairman.",
