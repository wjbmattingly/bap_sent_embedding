<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I believe that I am to address you today, Visser on record.  Perhaps with you leave, just before we start, a few matters of housekeeping importance.  Mr Chairman, we have foreshadowed that we will make available to you a list of incidents, politically related incidents which transpired in the Durban area, from approximately 1982 to 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>	We are attempting Mr Chairman, to procure photocopies thereof, although without success at the moment.  I am informed Mr Chairman, that there is a problem with the photocopy machine that is available to us here, but as soon as that becomes available Mr Chairman, we will certainly let you have that.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>	May we suggest Mr Chairman, that that Exhibit might be called Exhibit A, and its description will be a list of politically related incidents in Port Natal.  We might have one copy, pardon me for a moment.  We seem to have two here Mr Chairman, we have handed it to some of our learned friends.  May I ask through the Chair, whether our learned friend, Mr Ngubane has received a copy of this.  Have we given you a copy Mr Ngubane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> No, not yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, with your indulgence, might we hand one to you and your Commissioners at this stage, and one to Mr Ngubane, and as soon as they are ready, we will let you have them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>	Two pages are still to be added to the front Mr Chair.  One will have the legend Exhibit A, and the heading Politically Related Incidents, and the second page that is still missing from that bundle which you have before you, is an index which I have prepared Mr Chairman, with a summary of the number of incidents.  That will be handed to you in due course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>	Mr Chairman, we also are going to refer straight away to certain other documents, which have already been reproduced.   The one is an affidavit by Mr Adrian Steven Rosslee, it is a handwritten affidavit Mr Chairman which I am informed, you have already before you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>	It looks like this Mr Chairman.  I think at this stage, there are two.  The one is one of Mr Hugo's clients, and the other is, two handwritten affidavits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> One of Ramatala and one ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and the other is the Rosslee one, the one I wish to refer to Mr Chairman.  Might that be marked Exhibit B then Mr Chairman.  Is yours not stapled together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I have a stapler here Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I am also informed that you have already been handed three psychiatric reports.  The first is by Russel E. Matthews.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Robertse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And Potgieter, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will make that one bundle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, I was going to suggest with respect, perhaps Matthews could be C1, Potgieter C2 and Robertse, C3, just taken at random Mr Chairman, for no particular reason in that order.  Well, any order will do, but I suggest that Matthews, Potgieter and Robertse Mr Chairman, simply because it is alphabetical.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Robertse will be C3.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Matthews is C1.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Potgieter C2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> C2, and Robertse C3, Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, and then with your leave, lastly, my learned friend, Mr Prior had kindly made available to us, an extract from the charge sheet of the Dudu Buthelezi case to which we will refer as the Ramlakan case, and that is a document which has the legend on the right hand top, Annexure G, and it says Acts Performed/Committed by Accused 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Accused 8.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Oh, I see, I thought both of those Mr Chairman, can conveniently be grouped together as Exhibit D, unless there is a specific reason why my learned friend wishes to have them separated into two separate Exhibits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand it is common cause that 7, is Mela?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct, that is how we were given to understand Mr Chairman.  In fact, 8 is the gentleman by the name of Pumeso Nxiweni.  Pumeso is in fact one of the deceased for whose death amnesty is sought in these proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>	We will refer to him as Pumeso Mr Chairman, because it falls easier on the tongue than Nxiweni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>	Mr Chairman, the application before you this morning, is the application of Sergeant Adrian Steven Rosslee, who applies for amnesty for any unlawful act, omission or offence committed by him in respect of the abduction, the arrest, detention, assassination and the disposal of the body of one Sipho Stanley Bhila, on 22 February 1987 as well as for the unlawful possession of a firearm or firearms and ammunition utilised to assassinate Mr Bhila and for any other act, omission or offence in respect thereof, including any act, omission or offence perpetrated by him in regard to the above, after the event, including the cover up thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you go on with anything, can I go back and suggest that we have been given Ramatala's affidavit.  It has been referred to, that we should call that Exhibit E.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As it pleases you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And we have been given ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I must just make this one observation Mr Chairman, my Attorney has gone through this, it seems obscure what this is doing here.  I am not sure whether Mr Prior wants to use it and for what purpose, but I am just wondering whether we should burden the record until we find out whether this ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We can leave that out, but let's get Ramatala in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There are so many papers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, thank you Mr Chairman, that is in order.  If my learned friend, Mr Prior wants to refer to the record of the evidence, well then obviously that can be handed in at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>	Mr Chairman, Mr Rosslee presents himself as a witness to be sworn in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">ADRIAN STEVEN ROSSLEE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, the application you will find in the Bhila volume, called bundle 1 rather, at page 22 and following.  If I may first of all Mr Chairman, draw your attention yet again, as you have become accustomed to, to paragraph 7(a) and (b) for the information of the two members of your panel, who have not previously heard how this came about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>	Mr Chairman, to cut a very long story short, it came down to a misinterpretation on the reading of paragraph 7(a) and (b) and it is entirely not the fault of the applicants and you will recall Mr Chairman, that on many occasions we have applied for those two paragraphs to be amended as we do again today, for paragraph 7(a) to read National Party and for paragraph 7(b) to read supporter and that not applicable be struck out in both those subparagraphs, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That amendment is made to the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As it pleases you Mr Chairman.  Mr Rosslee, you are the applicant in this matter, and it concerns the death of Mr Bhila.  You have requested in your application, that the written submissions by the Foundation for Equality before the Law, which is presently and I might add Mr Chairman, for the first time fortunately, included in the papers before the Committee, in the Zandile bundles, volume 2, page 169, volume 2, pages 169 - 404.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I have assumed Mr Visser (indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In due course Mr Chairman.  In point of fact, as in the past Mr Chairman, you will find that because it relates really to background studies and so on, it is more conveniently dealt with in written argument and not in the evidence, so we won't burden you today over much, with reference thereto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>	In this particular case of Mr Rosslee, I think there are two brief references, but we certainly won't labour the going through those documents with you during this hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>	Secondly Mr Rosslee, if I may proceed, the written submissions which were handed in Gen Johannes Velder van der Merwe, to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is in Zandile, volume 1, page 126 - 156 and then there is a statement attached to the previous document, which I have referred to, a statement by previous Commissioners of Police and that is contained in Zandile, volume 1 pages 157 - 168.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>	Lastly, Mr Rosslee is it correct that you have been informed of certain evidence which was presented by ex-Minister of Law and Order, Mr Adrian Vlok and Gen Van der Merwe in the</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>COSATU House/Khotso House application for amnesty, and you find yourself in agreement and you make common cause generally with their evidence.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Will you please now Mr Rosslee, take over and inform the Committee, tell the Committee something about yourself, your personal background, etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I was born in 1960 in Pretoria, I was raised in a pretty conservative and disciplined household.  I was raised with the understanding or the belief that the government of the day, which was then the National Party, was the party to support.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>	Prominent people in my childhood, through my schooling, etc, supported and grew that belief in me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, when you refer to prominent people, what type of people do you refer to, who expressed opinions about the government policy of the day when you were growing up, what type of person are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It would be obviously politicians that we had heard on radio and so forth, teachers, business people that we came into contact with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Even ministers of the church?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Ministers as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was it fashionable in those days when you grew up, post 1960 say to 1970, 1975, was it fashionable to criticise the government policy of separate development or apartheid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I believe it was not fashionable to criticise that.  I think the majority of the people, and certainly my belief at that time was that that was the policy to go with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As is manifested by the fact that election after election, the same party was voted in as the government, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You joined the police in 1978, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you have set out a summary at pages 22 and page 23, pages 22 and 23, of the Bhila volume 1, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And just to summarise it if I may, for purposes of saving time, you in fact had more than one force number, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You joined the police in January of the year 1978 and you were first stationed in the Uniform Branch from July 1978 and you did five tours of duty in South West Africa and two trips of duty on the RSA borders of the RSA and Botswana and the far Northern Transvaal, would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You were placed with the Security Branch, Northern Transvaal in their division of VIP bodyguards in 1980?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you first left the South African Police in 1981?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In 1981 - 1983, you did the two call ups in South West Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And in 1984, you got shot by an anti-tank missile, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> The vehicle I was driving in, got shot out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, got shot out, yes all right.  I am sorry yes, I said you got shot, the vehicle got shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>	In 1986 you were recruited to Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And in May 1987, you resigned from the South African Police, would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would you please, if you would Mr Rosslee, just tell the Committee something about the influences upon you flowing from your duties and experiences as a policeman in the service of the South African Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> During that time, the very strong influences on myself and I am sure a lot of other serving policemen to the political circumstances in the country at that stage, was the rioting and civil unrest that was rife then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>	The many deaths, injuries and damage to property, attacks against the (indistinct), including police officers and police stations, were virtually everyday occurrences then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you personally exposed to situations and incidents of violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> On many occasions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you see people who had died as a result of attacks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I had seen quite a lot of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, yes, we won't go into the details of that Mr Rosslee, I know it is painful for you to recall.  Would you please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I think what probably had the biggest effect on me, was when the liberation forces started targeting civilians and at that stage, I was at the Security Branch, doing ANC/PAC investigations and came into very close contact with those victims, being either policemen or civilians that had been murdered, petrol bombed, shot or whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>	During my experience in the bush, I was in various contacts, I've been in landmine explosions, also seen civilians blown up by landmines, I have been blown up by landmines and that had a very deep and lasting effect on me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, before we go on, could I interrupt here.  Could I interrupt, could you indicate the rank you held at various times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would you please do that Mr Rosslee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, until approximately 1984 or 1985, I held the rank of  Constable and then was promoted to the rank of Sergeant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That was your last increase in rank, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Rosslee, it is a matter of history now that your experiences through these years, in the South African Police caused you to suffer certain psychological effects.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you just inform the Committee about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have been under psychological treatment and diagnosed with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of experiences during my time in the South African Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Have you received treatment for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have been hospitalised and have received treatment Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Are you presently receiving treatment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Are there problems with your medical aid fund for payment of these treatments?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> To a large degree, I haven't had medical aid since April last year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And do you have to fund your treatment on your own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> There is a report placed before the Committee, marked Exhibit C1, of a certain Russel E. Matthews, who describes himself as a Clinical Phycologist and according to his report, it appears that you have been divorced for 11 years at the time when he saw you in January 1997?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you have a son and a daughter, the daughter being the eldest of the two children who would now be around 14 and the son would now be around 12, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My daughter is 15 and my son is 13.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> 13?  In whose custody are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> The children have been in my custody for I think it is about 10 or 11 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, and Dr Matthews says at page 2, in paragraph 2.4.8 that you are intensely aware that there is something drastically wrong with you, because of certain things which you experienced, would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Part of which was that you have nightmares?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You make excessive use of alcohol and you have backflashes and relive certain incidents which he refers to as "sluipmoord insidente", but certain incidents from your past in which there was violence, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And other things.  He describes you Mr Rosslee as a superior intelligent person who is extremely depressive at page 3, and he says in paragraph 3.2.5 and I quote "further it seems that the patient does not have a very high frustration level and he does not always, he cannot always control his feelings of aggression".</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>	Would you say and you must take the punishment Mr Rosslee, would you say that that is a correct description of your condition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, I would say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> 3.2.7 the Doctor says on the Rorschach Test, the patient deliver responses which entails themes of war and death.  Is that a theme that is foremost in your mind, and which you cannot rid yourself of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It is something I would like to rid myself of, but I have not been able to Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you compensate for this by, says the Doctor, by appearing self assured and we also know that you try to compensate for that by using alcohol in excess, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is right, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I am not going to repeat the rest of Annexure C2 and C3, they speak for themselves.  But as you say, you suffer from major depression which Dr Potgieter refers to, bottom of the page, and you are diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I am not going to go through the rest.  It speaks for itself.  In effect, Mr Rosslee, is it fair to say that you have tried your best to remove, expunge from your memory, your experiences from the past?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have tried Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you may even have succeeded to some extent, but you are here today and you understand that you've got to make full disclosure, so painful as it might be, you are called upon to delve into your memory in order to place before this Committee the full relevant facts as you can remember it.  So, that is your duty today, painful as it may be, that is what the Act requires of you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>	Will you please Mr Rosslee, give the Committee some insight into how you experienced the political background to the incident for which you are applying for amnesty today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I will.  The political situation at the stage we are talking about when this incident occurred, was when the Security Branch and the Security Forces were being asked to do more and more in the conflict of the political struggle, which at that stage, I think most of us had regarded as being a war situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>	We had to fight and the feeling was we were fighting an undeclared war, we were fighting against terrorists and soldiers and being expected to act as policemen within the parameters of the law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> On the other hand, the forces that you were fighting, were they also fighting according to rules?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Not from where we were standing, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, is that all that you want to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, at that stage, Mr Chairman, the feeling was also that with their (indistinct) and support if you like that the liberation movements had at that stage, "everybody" was, if he was a patriot, he was a combatant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>	Every black person at that stage, I suppose we regarded as being potentially MK cadres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In the words of the ANC, a worker by day and a soldier by night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It became apparent that we were losing grounding in the struggle, or it appeared that we were losing ground in the struggle, and that more and more pressure was being put on us to perform more, to do more, to curb the rising tide as it were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  To use the old cliche, if I may to normalise the situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> The result was that I think myself and a lot of my colleagues, were acting more like soldiers than what we were policemen, because of the nature of the conflict we were in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you consider that that is what was expected from you, in effect was that what it boiled down to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, it was my opinion that the only way we were going to curb what we were facing, was by fighting it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Our role changed as I perceived it, more from investigations and criminal matters to dealing with political matters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>	The Security Branch, we were being exposed to all the political ideologies, etc, that we were made to study.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, the normal policeman being a person who should be there to prevent crime, investigate crime, and to take people to court to be prosecuted.  In the case of ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To protect the public from crime?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I hope I didn't say anything different.  I make the mistake of not listening to myself when I am talking Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>	In any event, and here you found yourself, is that what you are saying, embroiled in a political struggle which is very different from normal policing duties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman, especially in the light of the amount of time a lot of us spent in the bush and then coming back to what is referred to in those days, as Civvy Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you find any difficulty in readapting after coming back from the bush as you put it, to normal Civvy Street, where rules and regulations applied and where you as policemen were expected to abide by the precise four corners of legal enactments and legal empowerment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, I believe the difficulty to a large degree lay in that the people or the forces we were fighting in the bush, were fundamentally the same people we were encountering on the streets in towns and cities when we came back, and we had to fight them with a different set of rules.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Would you please continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I also believe that because we have the changing scenario on South Africa and pressure put on us to perform, that to a certain degree, I know I did, you believe that if we operated not strictly within the law, that it would not necessarily be condoned, but that it wouldn't be wrong in totality.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> A blind eye might be turned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Is it your impression that Gen Erasmus, who gave evidence before an Amnesty Committee in Port Elizabeth, was correct when he said that he never reported higher up, because there would have been repercussions, but he got the distinct impression that even if people higher up knew, they wouldn't have said anything, because it would have suited them if they thought that unlawful conduct was in fact assisting in fighting the battle at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, I do believe that whoever it was, senior people of the Force, government, whoever, believed that it suited or the means justified the ends that there would have been a blind eye turned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Adrian Vlok, on more than one occasion gave evidence, particularly in the COSATU House and the Khotso House amnesty application, that with hindsight he considers himself guilty of exerting pressure by making use of certain phrases and certain language whereby the impression could have been created with members of the Police, that they were expected to act illegally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>	Is that really what you were referring to at this particular stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I would say so, because being exhorted to hunt the enemy, drive them out, whatever.  To our mind at that stage there wasn't a lot of ways or many ways in which to interpret that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and also as far as the awarding of medals were concerned, where it now appears quite frequently, that medals were rewarded where in fact the actions that were taken, were in fact illegal and which again, would have instilled a bona fide belief with the members, did it not, that there was condonation of what they were doing, although it was illegal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I believe so Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  And Gen Van der Merwe gave evidence, perhaps you can just tell the Committee what he said and whether you agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My understanding is that Gen Van der Merwe said that we were practically being in a war situation, it was understandable that members of the Security Branch, that the distinction between what is legal and illegal, could become a very grey area, and he could understand our members who were involved in this political war, could well believe or have bona fide belief that if they did something illegal for the government, it fell within the parameters of our duties, because we were doing what was expected of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you have that same ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, where - this quote, do you have a reference to that?  I didn't find that specific quote in his statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, yes, I am afraid, we didn't want to burden the record with adding the record of the COSATU House/Khotso House, it comes from that amnesty application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>	If you wish, we  could make a printout of that page and give it to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I will appreciate it if it is available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes certainly Mr chairman, we will do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>	I must say that there is a reference to the grey area also in the papers now before us, my Attorney is just looking for it, if he finds it, I will draw your attention to that reference Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>	In paragraph 10(a) and (b) of your written application, at page 27 - 30 of the Bhila volume, you briefly stated general aspects of the political objective in regard to the particular act for which you apply for amnesty for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>	Do you confirm the contents thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I do Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In point of fact, before I forget, do you confirm the whole of your written application form, apart from those issues relating to the facts of this incident, which we will address later, and which you will attempt to give an explanation for certain divergent evidence, which appears.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>	Apart from that, do you confirm the correctness of the balance of your affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I do Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I am going to interrupt the leading of the evidence, because this is important.  We are referring to page 165 of the Zandile bundle 1.  In paragraph 26, you will find a paragraph in the statement by the Generals, so here it is not particularly Gen Van der Merwe speaking, but the contents of this, I would gladly read to you Mr Chairman, it says the nature of this conflict and violence, blurred the traditional distinction between combatants and non-combatants, between legitimate and illegitimate targets and more importantly, between acceptable and unacceptable methods.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>	They often occurred in a grey area between legitimate orders given, the interpretation of such orders in circumstances where secrecy and other factors made proper communication difficult or impossible.  The requests which were not always properly expressed or formulated and a mixing of cultures of the various Security departments through the National Management System, which negatively effected the normal day to day functioning of the South African Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>	But we will find the other and let you have it Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If I could just point out that this does not refer to illegal acts being their duties, which was what I referred to previously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I take your point Mr Chairman.  Would you care to elaborate on the question of political objectives to what you have already stated in your application, at pages 27 - 30 Mr Rosslee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I can only speak from my viewpoint and from what I have heard and seen from friends and colleagues of mine in the SAP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>	I would like to say in the case, many of us served on the South African borders and outside the South African borders and South West Africa or Namibia and Angola, and I in particular, I think did seven tours of duty in the bush.  I was subjected to counter-insurgency training, advanced training and also served and was subjected to or underwent further counter-insurgency training in South West Africa with the Koevoet Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>	What it boils down to is myself and a lot of members in those days, were trained to think and act like soldiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You have told us that when returning to Civvy Street as it were, you had certain problems to adapt.  After you became transferred to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry Mr Visser, may I just get some indication from the applicant, what does he mean by trained and act like soldiers.  Could you just describe that for us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, to my way of thinking when I became a policeman, I wasn't going to be hunting terrorists on a daily basis where they were using explosives, automatic weapons and that sort of thing against us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>	My mind, when I became a policeman was, we are going to catch criminals, take them to courts of law, and they were going to be incarcerated.  In this case, we were fighting a war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was your understanding that you would fight it, indeed like is expected of a member of the Defence Force, like a soldier in other words, within a discipline and hierarchy and structure, that indeed rules existed, or are you using this in a metaphorical way, different to what is expected of a soldier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman, I am not quite with the question there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you to act basically as a member of the Defence Force or are you saying more than that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I believe that Mr Chairman, that we probably did more than that, because we were a specialised unit, and more was expected of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What more?  Could you please describe that.  I am not sure how I should understand your evidence.  If you say we were trained to act like soldiers, soldiers are also subject to rules, discipline, order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I agree with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What are you saying, are you saying only that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Sir, I agree that yes, we had the discipline, we had the training, there were structures, etc, but the line between being a soldier and a war situation and being a policeman, are very different things in my mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That I fully understand, I want to understand what you mean by being a soldier, that is effectively like any other member of the Defence Force or any special Task Unit, subject to their rules, subject to the discipline, subject to orders of higher officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I agree to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand, you are talking about soldiers in a war situation, not soldiers in peace?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct, that is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just to elaborate perhaps on that Mr Rosslee, South West, the northern part of South West Africa, at the time of the operations of Koevoet, was it declared operational area, isn't that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that would have been under the control of the Military?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you were required and ordered to work together with the Military in South West Africa, while you were a member of Koevoet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> There was a lot of cooperation, yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I am not suggesting for a moment that your duties were to perform operations together with the Army all the time, but it did happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It most definitely did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and those operations were basically or sometimes at least, seek and destroy operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  There would be attacks and you would follow or track the perpetrators down and if there was a fight, there would be people killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is that what you are referring to when you talk about acting as a soldier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It is not as if you walked with your briefcase with a docket under your arm, into the bush?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Most definitely not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, and thank you to the panel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I gather from other evidence we have heard about Koevoet operations, you fought against them, but one of your main objectives was to try to capture the terrorists to endeavour to turn them, so that you could use them later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you to you Mr Chairman.  All right, you now are in the Security Branch Mr Rosslee, and you have already told the Committee, that you became more and more subjected to the political perspectives, which you were required to deal with, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You came into contact with different ideologies and different points of view of organisations and groupings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is right Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you have to, were you required to make studies of these different organisations and groupings and different ideologies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, yes, within the Security Branch we went on courses where we were educated with regard to different political ideologies, etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, I might be forgiven perhaps to say that you were brainwashed in a sense.  You were given one perspective and one perspective only, from one angle, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Most certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  And did you accept that as being a true and correct perspective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> The exposure to dangers from supporters, cadres of the liberation movements, attacks, assassinations, attempts on policemen, attacks on policemen, murders of policemen, etc, had a very profound effect on me.  They were colleagues of mine that were killed in the townships, while on duty, etc, while they were performing their duties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and I think you have dealt with your experiences, I am not going to revisit that Mr Rosslee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>	All along, during the exercise and execution of your duties, was there also another sense of responsibility which dominated you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I would say the overriding sense of responsibility would have been to the community or the citizens of the country at that stage, to protect them from as it became know, the "Red Danger" and what was happening in the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was it your realisation, your experience that you were able to do so effectively?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I believed that yes, we could fight the war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> To protect the public effectively from attacks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> The worse it got, I think the more disillusioned we got about how effective we were in countering.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Not to make bones about it, the police were just not able to adequately protect the public.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We saw bomb attacks, especially in the area Natal, not so, the Amanzimtoti bomb attack, etc, where people were killed and injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What effect did that have on you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I would say it made me personally a lot more determined to do more, to be more effective in countering the threat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  I think enough of that Mr Rosslee.  If you are asked in cross-examination about anything, you are quite willing to delve deeper into the political background, etc.  Perhaps we can come to the merits, to the facts of this particular case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>	We know it took place some ten, eleven years ago and normally one's memory would fail.  In your case, you have told the Committee that you have pointedly attempted to forget, but let's see how much you can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>	We also know that there are certain, there is a certain divergence of evidence and we will try to deal with it as we go along.  Can you from your own memory state what you remember, about the Bhila incident, starting with where it was first, it first came to be spoken about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Right, I was at Vlakplaas at that stage, and we were busy with routine duties down in Durban, Port Natal.  McCarter and myself were with Major Andy Taylor, when he asked us to eliminate Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In your application, Mr Rosslee, as was pointed out yesterday by the Honourable Chairman, to me, the last paragraph at page 24 of the Bhila volume 1, your application stated in Durban, we were met by Mr L. Wasserman of the local Security Branch.  He told us that two of the accused in the Amanzimtoti bomb blast criminal trial, had been acquitted, but was still continuing their subversive actions and that our task was to "arrest" them for purposes of elimination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>	Then you go on that you assume that the orders came from higher up.  Is that statement, well, is that paragraph entirely correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It is not Mr Chairman.  Mr Wasserman was our normal liaison when we came down to Port Natal, and in normal matters, everyday matters, he would have briefed us on the situation in Port Natal, but that is obviously incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, but when you signed this affidavit, believing at the time that it was Mr Wasserman that gave the order, is that the reason why you assumed that the orders have come from higher up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It would have been one of the reasons yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what would have been the reason for assuming that the order came from higher than Mr Wasserman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Well, I find it difficult that someone like Mr Wasserman could make that decision in the light of the seriousness of the act that we were asked to commit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  All right, now application also refers to the elimination of people who were involved in the Amanzimtoti bomb blast criminal trial.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I remember that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Then I must immediately interrupt your line of thinking, by taking you to Exhibit B.  Exhibit B, purports to be an affidavit, signed by you, do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I agree Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And it was in fact signed by you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Will you please tell the Committee first of all how it came about in April 1996, that you signed this.  Mr Chairman, the date appears on the last page, page 7 of Annexure B, 12th of April, so it seems.  Yes, it appears on two places Mr Chairman, 12th of April 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>	How did it come about that you signed this affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Well, my brother contacted me and said that the Attorney General's Special Investigation Team was looking for me and that they could not find me, and gave me ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just go a little slower, there is nothing to rush you, just go slower, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> And gave me a telephone number to call which was that of Captain Holmes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Captain Holmes?  Yes, did you call him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I called him and they asked me to come into the office because they had some questions to ask me about incidents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Under extreme stress, yes, I did Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What transpired there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I was confronted by Captain Holmes, I think it was Brigadier Human and one or two other people and I was confronted with the statement made by Steve Bosch, with regard to the Bhila incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was that the witness that gave evidence yesterday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How do you mean you were confronted with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I was confronted with that in the fashion that it was put in front of me and said, we already know what has happened, you might as well cooperate with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>	If you don't cooperate, we are going to arrest you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Arrest you for what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> For the murder of Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see.   Was the contents of Mr Bosch's affidavit then conveyed to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> In broad outlines, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would that have been in what sense, in the sense that it would be read to you that Mr Bosch says this, what do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Very much so.  Captain Holmes would say Mr Bosch says X, Y and Z, what do you say about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, so indeed in your affidavit you dealt with issues even if it was merely to say I can't remember that, whatever the case may be, and we will come to that in a moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>	All right, from Annexure B it would appear that you were in Durban in 1987, between the 10th of February and the 27th of February, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is the third paragraph on page 1 Mr Chairman.  I don't know whether your pages have been paginated, I hope they have.  It is from page 1 - 7.  I do apologise Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>	The last paragraph, the second last paragraph states that this is a Section 204 affidavit and it says, this affidavit says, what I am going to point out later, might not be used against me as evidence in a court, for what that is worth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>	Then at page 2, I wish to address your attention to.  You were now clearly asked about Frank McCarter and Steve Bosch in the first paragraph, you deal with that, and then I want to come to the third paragraph where you say first of all that the group was sent by Major De Kock to go for that period which you referred to, to Natal.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>	We heard here yesterday from Exhibit D, that there will be evidence that Major De Kock was in fact on leave at the time, and this is supported, that is the second page Mr Chairman, second paragraph, in fact it is numbered paragraph 5 of Ramatala's evidence in E, I said D, it is E, Exhibit E.  It is the second page, paragraph 5.  He refers to the use of motorcars which to his mind, supports his statement that Mr De Kock was on leave, so first of all, let me ask you this, are you clear in your mind, and can you positively state that you were sent to Durban by De Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot positively state that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you simply assume that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I assume that, because Mr De Kock would normally task us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, all right.  Al l right, now let's just go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you go on, you obviously had experienced this before.  Is the position that requests would be made to Major De Kock, was he then, from police officers elsewhere in the country, for assistance on routine matters and a group of you would be sent from Vlakplaas to the area to assist the officer in charge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And whilst in that area, you would be responsible to the officer in charge of that area and report to him, and take instructions from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, with feedback to Major De Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was a feedback to Major De Kock, he was told what you were doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Except that in this case, apparently Major De Kock says that he knew absolutely nothing about it, and which might be another point supporting the contention that he was on leave at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>	In any event, you don't know what happened in this particular case as far as reporting to Major De Kock was concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I have no direct knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, may I just ask then, on what basis are you, do you say that you have knowledge that there was reporting back to Major De Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I said from my previous experience with the units, working in different areas, I know that there were reports given back to Major De Kock on our activities, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you personally report to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So, how would you know that others did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Because I would be with the person in charge of the unit, either when they were speaking to him telephonically or whatever the case may be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And in this instance, you have no recollection of any feedback?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman and Mr Malan.  Just to go back to the question of the Chairman, there will be evidence later from other applicants in the other incidents, but is it your recollection that Major Andy Taylor at the time, was the Commanding Officer if you will, of the Terrorist Desk, Section?  Let me repeat that, of the Anti-Terrorist Section - a tongue twister - in Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would he then have been the one to request a squad from Vlakplaas if he needed assistance in the monitoring and pointing out of suspected terrorists which may have infiltrated into the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And would he then have been the person from whom you would have, your squad or your squad leader would have taken his instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is also correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Your previous evidence was that Mr Wasserman was the person who normally briefed you in that situation, on the facts, all right, now we understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>	Now, coming to the discussion which is at the bottom of page 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Visser, just before you proceed there, in the same paragraph which you have covered now, the second part of it, Mr Rosslee states from time to time we received instructions from Major Taylor.  These instructions were discussed with Major De Kock beforehand, in order to gain his approval before we did any acts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>	Can Mr Rosslee tell us if in this case, whether did Major De Kock while he was on leave, or whoever was acting in his place, was he contacted in order to get approval?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have no recollection of getting approval from anybody on the farm for this specific incident Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why did you then - I am sorry - would you then please explain why you said so in this affidavit, because it appears that you might be referring to this particular incident, rather than speaking generally, does it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It does appear that way Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, when I made this statement, I was under extreme pressure.  I was also being led by Captain Holmes with regard to him asking me questions, I was speaking in English, he was taking the statement in Afrikaans and I am sure between the two of us, and my stress levels at that stage, it is quite possible that I assumed a lot of things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Excuse me Mr Rosslee, can you speak Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you speak it fluently?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Because you say under oath that you made the statement in Afrikaans, so you were not speaking in English and he was writing in Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> We both spoke both languages.  We spoke English and Afrikaans, mixed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did I not hear you say now that you spoke English and he wrote in Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why do you make a statement and you sign it under oath, that you made this statement in Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> For me there is not a big difference between whether I speak Afrikaans or English, it was easier for him and that is it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, I was speaking Afrikaans now specifically just to test your Afrikaans, but are you saying that indeed the conversation was in Afrikaans, because that is what you said under oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, it was in both languages, because I speak English and Afrikaans, I mix them up all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why did you then now, earlier say that you were talking in English, he was writing in Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Because most of the time, I would have been speaking English, because obviously when you are under stress and that, I go back to my home language.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And staying with this paragraph just a moment longer, was your intention with the words that you spoke or that you spoke or that was written here, that were written here, to refer to this particular incident when you referred to "vooraf uitgeklaar", or was your intention to speak generally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I was referring to generally, we would get clarification or the go ahead from Mr De Kock on anything we did in the field.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is that the reason why the plural is used, the instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I should imagine so, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, all right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can I take it a bit further then, when you made this statement, were you under the impression that Major De Kock was indeed at Vlakplaas, so when you made the statement, you were also under the impression that this was cleared out with him beforehand, because you do not distinguish?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have no recollection of him being on the farm, being on leave, or the statement, the actions applying here for, being cleared with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Let me just follow the line of responsibility please.  You said in your evidence which was led, that when you went to Natal, you fell under the command of Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He would have given you the instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And then you had to make sure that these instructions were carried out?  These instructions, were they usually cleared out with Major De Kock beforehand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Normally when I say it was professional courtesy ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, my apologies again for having spoken Afrikaans, but if you have no difficulty then you can continue to answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I think number one it was a professional courtesy to inform Major De Kock, what we were up to from the people who requested our presence wherever we were working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Rosslee, are you saying it was a courtesy to De Kock, or did you have to clear the instructions as you said in your affidavit with Major De Kock, there is quite a difference is there not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I would say a bit of both.  Number one, getting approval from Major De Kock, that we were going to do something, and number two, keeping him in the picture as to what we were busy with down here, wherever we were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So if he was not in agreement with any of the instructions, he would have said to you no, or he would have confirmed it and only then did it become a real instruction, was that your understanding of the operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That was my understanding of how it would operate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you did not have to comply with any order of Taylor, unless De Kock would have, or whoever was at that moment in charge at Vlakplaas, would have confirmed the order.  Is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My understanding is that I would have had confirmation from Vlakplaas, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand it, you were sent down regularly to do routine, what amounted to routine work, that was to oversee the askaris in their identification, in their surveillance of suspected terrorists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That was the routine.  Here you were being asked to do something completely different, that is to murder someone who had just been acquitted in court?  It would have been very important, wouldn't it, to have checked that with the Commanding Officer at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I believe it would.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because that is not what you had been sent there to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Because of the seriousness or the nature of the act, my belief is yes, it probably would have been cleared out, or should have been cleared with, should have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It should have been cleared up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It should have been cleared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, well, let us step off that paragraph then and go to the next.  We come now to this discussion which is the point which we reached on your application form, before we went to Exhibit B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>	You say in Exhibit B, you say there were discussions held with Mr Taylor and Lawrie Wasserman.  The three of us, the three members from Vlakplaas that is, our three members of Vlakplaas, or us three members of Vlakplaas, McCarter, Bosch and yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct, we were the three members down at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  And at this meeting where you heard the order or the request, whatever you want to call it, concerning Mr Bhila, in your affidavit, Exhibit B you say the three members, white members to put it that way, from Vlakplaas were there, as well as Wasserman, together with Major Taylor.  What do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> At the stage of making the statement, I believed that to be true.  Obviously in hindsight and in consultation and listening to other evidence, that is not the fact and I recall that it was Major Taylor, McCarter and myself who were together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What you can positively give evidence to is the fact that you were there and you know McCarter was there, and you know Taylor was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Then in both Exhibit B as well as in your application form, you speak of two persons who had been acquitted.  In fact, in Exhibit B you say two or three persons who had been acquitted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>	What is your recollection today, do you still stand with two or is it one or is it two or three?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My recollection is that at that briefing, we spoke about two people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  McCarter seems to recall only one person, Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I can't speak for McCarter, Mr Chairperson, I recall speaking or hearing about two people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In this case, you are not prepared to make the concession that you might be wrong, because this is a vivid recollection of yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I remember very clearly speaking of two people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  They were black men, these two people you say in your Exhibit B, do you recall that as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I remember that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I want you to cast your mind back to the time and tell the Committee as best you can remember, what exactly Taylor said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, I cannot remember the exact words, but the gist of it was that these people had been acquitted for bombing incidents or a bomb incident, for some reason Amanzimtoti stayed with me, and that because of their previous history, training and the potential for them to get even more or further involved in the activities and the potential for further loss of life,  bombings, etc, that they should be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  You did not remember at the time when you signed your application form at page 24, or at the time that you signed your affidavit, Exhibit B the names of any of the two?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, the first time I heard, or I recalled the name of the deceased, was when Captain Holmes brought it to my attention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right.  The question of what particular incident it was that they were acquitted of in court, appears also to be confusing to your mind.  In your application you say it was the Amanzimtoti bomb and we know which one that is and in Exhibit B, page 3, you refer to a McGoo bomb.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.  I suppose when I made the statement, the 204 statement, that I either couldn't remember Amanzimtoti or which incident, and McGoo's having been also a very prominent bomb, that probably stuck in my mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, but what you do remember is that it was a prominent incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I do Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Major Taylor was referring to.  Is that the gist of what you can remember was discussed at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Whatever Mr Taylor told you, did it convince you to make common cause with the elimination of and we now know it was Mr Bhila, did it convince you to make common cause?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Based on what Major Taylor told us, I was convinced that we had to eliminate him or else further damage or acts of violence were going to be perpetrated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you personally aware of the security situation, the unrest situation in Natal at the time, 1987, what it was like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I was.  I was very aware of the fact that as McCarter referred to it yesterday, it was called Bombay, or the nickname was Bombay in those days, because of all the activities, explosions, etc taking place here then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> There will be evidence later, Mr Rosslee about this from members of the unit of Port Natal who will give evidence before this Committee in more detail, but according to personal notes, personal record which was kept by Major Taylor, it appears that in 1987, there were 17 serious incidents of politically related violence.  Would that accord with your recollection of the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I wouldn't be able to stipulate a number, but I know that there was a lot of activity going on in Port Natal at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was a hotspot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It most definitely was, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> These discussions with Major Taylor, where did they take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My recollection is that it took place in his office as C.R. Swart Square.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were any of the black members from Vlakplaas present when this discussion took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Not to my recollection Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right.  Then you say in your amnesty application, page 25, the askaris were sent to the residence of one of the said suspects.  Do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't know that Mr Chairman.  I do not recall being actively involved in the actual planning, the logistics of how the deceased was going to be kidnapped or taken away.  I have no recollection of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What were you told?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My recollection is that Mr Bhila was going to be approached at home or somewhere, and he was going to be lured away from his home, under the pretext that the police or Security Branch was going to arrest him, and the askari or askaris who approached him, were there to take him out of the country for further training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> For his own safety?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> For his own safety, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And for further training, yes.  And when you say he believed the story and accompanied them to a shooting range, you were not present there, this was a matter of deduction on your part, isn't that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Let us come then to the actual morning of the abduction of Mr Bhila by asking you, were you personally present when he was either asked to get into a vehicle or transferred from one vehicle to another as far as you can remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot remember being present when the transfer or handover or whatever, took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Your recollection is clear that firstly you were present yourself, on this particular day, the 22nd of February at the Winkelspruit pistol shooting range of the South African Railway Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I was present there, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you can remember that a person who we now know is Mr Bhila, was also present there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As to the sequence of arrivals, I don't want to confuse you about when Mr Bhila and so on arrived, but I just want to ask you this, did Mr Wasserman who will also come and give evidence directly after you, proceed to the shooting range in your company or what was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My recollection is that Major Taylor and Mr Wasserman arrived later the afternoon Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you remember more or less what time it was that you arrived at the pistol shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> If I remember correctly, it was early in the morning, when I say early, it must have been about mid-morning probably, if I remember correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What time do you place on mid-morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I would say about nine, or ten o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Nine, or ten o'clock.  And what time would you say if you have to guess and reconstruct today, what time would you say that Taylor and Wasserman arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It would be a guess from my side, but I would say probably in the region of after half past three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, you refer to the fact that you and Bosch and McCarter as well as Wasserman, were - the sentence doesn't really make sense, it is the bottom of page 3, perhaps I should just read it, it says I, Bosch, McCarter, Wasserman and I cannot recall if Major Taylor arrived there later at an old club house that was situated at an old shooting range, where we were waiting for the kidnapped person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>	That seems to suggest, does it not, that Wasserman was already there and maybe Taylor as well, waiting for the arrival of Mr Bhila.  And if it is what this suggests, I am asking you, was that correct as far as you are now concerned, having had the benefit of listening to other people and having had the benefit of rethinking the whole incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Having had the benefit of having spoken to and heard other people's evidence, I can say that what is in that 204 statement, with regard to that paragraph, was not correct.  I now remember Major Taylor and Mr Wasserman arriving later the afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  All right.  Can I just go back then a step, because I jumped a step, go back to paragraph 2 of Exhibit B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a>	After this conversation, this discussion had taken place at C.R. Swart Square, you have already told us that you weren't part of the planning, but you were told what had happened, etc.  You then go on to say if I recall correctly, Mike, which refers to Michael Lembede, Spyker, which refers to a person by the name of Spyker Mhieza, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And Wasserman were tasked with the kidnapping of the person, the abduction.  Now, what do you say of this paragraph today, with your knowledge which you have now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> The knowledge I have today, the recollection I have today is that the only reason I could have thought that Mhieza was present at all in this, was that in general he and Lembede would work together with us when we were down in Port Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a>	Because they generally reported in to Mr Wasserman, I suppose the mental picture would have been that the three of them were involved with it.  With hindsight, I know that one of the askaris actually did, or was tasked with approaching Mr Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, but you see this paragraph deals with the abduction, and what it says in plain language or plain Afrikaans language is that if you can remember correctly, Lembede, Mhieza and Wasserman were tasked to do the abduction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> In light of the evidence that has already been heard, and my own recollection, that is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, we might return to that.  Let's just go a little further, you then speak in Exhibit B, paragraph 2 the second part of it about the planning and you have already told us what that consisted of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I am sorry Mr Visser, if I can interrupt you.  Sorry, I don't know why I am getting back to Afrikaans every time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a>	Why Mr Rosslee are you saying, that is not correct that Wasserman, Spyker and Michael was not tasked to organise the abduction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> There would be two reasons Mr Chairman.  Number one is in consultation speaking to people, I remember that they weren't tasked to do that, and number two is, from an operational point of view, it would have been silly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, for interrupting you.  How can you remember that something did not take place?  Surely a memory goes as to something that indeed take place?  You cannot remember something that did not take place, but continue, answer it again.  I am just very much confused by such an answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> All right, from an operational point of view, with them being stationed down in Port Natal, it would have been silly to use them to approach Mr Bhila for an operation of that kind in broad daylight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So that is simply based on a deduction on what would have been rational or "prudent"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you have no specific other recollection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But as I understand this passage and I have a difficulty with the handwriting, what it says is these three people were responsible for the planning but an askari was to go to the house, you said you did not know the askari's name, but he had afro hairstyle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a>	It was not saying that these three people were to go to the house and expose themselves?  There was an askari and you described the askari's hairstyle if you read the second half of paragraph 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, the reason why the evidence is being presented as I have, is if you read the first part of paragraph 2 in isolation, it certainly gives the impression that these were the people who made ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It wasn't made in isolation.  It was made together.  He said these three and then he - now he says he can say they didn't because as they were stationed in Natal, they wouldn't have been used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>	If you read the whole document, they weren't going to be exposed.  It is this other askari who was going to expose himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I was just coming to that Mr Chairman, I don't think after your remarks that I need to go into it much further then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No sorry Mr Visser, this is important, because it also goes as to credibility.  Mr Rosslee makes a statement under oath, in which he makes very specific statements as to the planning, the task for the abduction, then he continues to say who in fact were used by the planning team to do, to effect the abduction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>	Now suddenly he tells us he can remember something that didn't take place.  That is a major problem.  If you could bring him back to the beginning of paragraph 2 and try to explain to us why that stands there, and furthermore why does he deny the correctness of that paragraph at this moment in time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> The reason I deny or question the veracity of that paragraph right now is just having thought through it, maybe or should I say that I have, I think that, or my supposition would be that Lembede or Spyker or Wasserman would be involved from the point of view that they were local, they knew where Bhila lived, etc.  From that point of view, they would be involved, giving addresses, maybe pointing out a house or something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a>	But the actual abduction, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then Mr Rosslee, isn't it probable that what you said in that first section of paragraph 2 on page 3 of Exhibit B, is exactly correct in terms of how your memory served you when you made the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a>	There is nothing abnormal in this content?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I believe not, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you believe that it is not correct, or do you believe that it indeed may well be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It may well be correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, the long and the short of it is that the distinction that is drawn between the abduction and the general planning as to how it would come about, would appear to be, would appear - well Mr Chairman, I don't want to lead the witness and certainly not on argument - perhaps I should put it differently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>	In the first part of paragraph 2, you talk of the abduction per se, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The next paragraph deals with the planning, as to how it would take place?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry Mr Visser, my understanding is very different, that the first deals with the overall planning.  Who was responsible for the abduction?  The second goes as to what indeed was the content of the plan which is overarched by the first paragraph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I am very happy to accept that, but I thought you were going to tell me, but look at the word "ontvoering", and what do you make of that, and that is the reason why I am leading this evidence in the way I am Mr Chairman, I am trying to be of assistance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a>	All right, I think let's turn the page, we have dealt with paragraph 3, let's go over to the next page.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just ask, the askari that you refer to Mr Rosslee, with the afro hairstyle, have you in the meantime been able to ascertain the name of the individual?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No idea Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry Mr Visser, in all your discussions in terms of this statement and also your application, you refer to two or three people, you specifically refer at least to two persons who had to be abducted and killed, that was part of the overall planning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Will you at some stage deal with that still, is that the intention or do we deal with that now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, we can take it no further, he remembers two, he doesn't remember the names.   The other persons remember one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a>	What can I tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Okay, may I then pursue that just for a moment?  Can you recall any planning or implementation on a second individual?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> None, whatsoever Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You were never again further involved in any planning or implementation, except the killing of what now turns out to be Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> None whatsoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you would not be able to say that in their planning, they did not involve other persons to kill a second individual?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I wouldn't have any knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I might if I may be allowed the luxury of speculating a little bit, I may be of some assistance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a>	It is a fact that there were four persons that were discharged from the Ramlakan case.  The one was Mr Bhila, then there was another person by the name of Mhlati I believe it was, I will get his name in a moment, but the other two are very important, the one was Zandile and the other was Pumeso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a>	So yes, Mr Chairman, Mr Malan is quite correct in his line of thinking, and you will hear later on during these hearings what happened to those two people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a>	Now, you say that Bhila, we are going to refer to him as Mr Bhila because we know it was Mr Bhila, was brought there by Michael Lembede and Spyker Mhieza.  I am not going to repeat the argument about you remembering or not remembering about Spyker or being uncertain about it, I am just going to leave it, because you have dealt with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>	But then you say there was another person who you thought might have been Mr  Letsatsi.  Now, first of all, who was Mr Letsatsi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Letsatsi was one of the members of Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you thought when you signed Exhibit B, that Letsatsi was one of the persons who arrived there with Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that letsatsi and the other askaris, doesn't he say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Oh yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> And the other askaris.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Oh yes, I am sorry, I am coming to that Mr Chairman.  Well, let's go on to that immediately.  The sentence then continues to say and the other askaris.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a>	Now you see the picture which we have now is Mr Bhila arrives, he is not only accompanied by Michael Lembede and Spyker Mhieza, but also by Letsatsi and all the other askaris.  First of all, how many other askaris can you recall, were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, I don't recall how many there were on the team on that specific trip down to Port Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Two or three more apart from Letsatsi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right.  Now, that is the scenario which the reader of paragraph 4 of Exhibit B, would be left with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a>	Do you have any explanation for these words appearing here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Number one, on Lembede and Mhieza, once again, it was probably an assumption on my part that the two of them were together as they generally were when we worked with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a>	With regard to Letsatsi and the other askaris, while I made the statement, Captain Holmes hauled out a bunch of S&amp;T forms and said do you remember X, Y, Z being there, etc?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did he ask you about Letsatsi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> He asked me if Letsatsi was there, I said I remember Letsatsi.  I can't remember if he and the other askaris were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and that is precisely if you read the paragraph in the context and against the background of what you have just stated, this is exactly what this paragraph says.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a>	He says I am not sure, but I think that Letsatsi was there.  So this was really in reply to a question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Now, again, if you want to be very technical Mr Rosslee, you talk about Mr Bhila having been bound, shackled or handcuffed, cuffed, and one of the (indistinct).  Can you remember precisely how, was it by his hands, by his feet, how was he cuffed, can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I do not recall at the shooting range if his hands were cuffed or if he had leg irons on or - whereas I have a recollection of him being secured though.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and then both in your application on page 25 as well as in Exhibit B paragraph 5, you speak of an interrogation of Mr Bhila.  What do you say today as to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, in hindsight and in listening to other evidence, all I can say to that is that I probably superimposed another incident that I have applied for amnesty for, onto this with regard to the interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did the other incident which you refer to, also involve the death of a person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It did Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In that case, was there in fact an interrogation that took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> There was Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is that the best explanation you can give for why you think that there was an interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is the only thing I can think of Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If you - today Mr Rosslee, can you specifically remember that there was an interrogation or is that not position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot today remember if Mr Bhila was interrogated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, all right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you make the applications for amnesty in these two incidents, on the same form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I believe so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think we should get the form and see whether you refer to interrogation in respect of the other person as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.  We thought of doing that, unfortunately my Attorney hasn't got that form here, but if you don't mind looking at my computer, I will show it to you on my laptop computer, because as it turned out last night, I searched and I found it Mr Chairman, I can assure you there was a reference to an interrogation of the other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So there is interrogation in both cases?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, no, in that other matter, and he was superimposing what he thought ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Doesn't he in his amnesty application in this case say, there was an interrogation?  Now he says there wasn't, he must have been confusing it with the other one, where he put there was an interrogation.  So he doubled the interrogations in his application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a>	Now he can once again, exclude something that he was confused about before, the problem we have been facing all morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I pursue that too, because I really have difficulty with this line.  What is very clear from Mr Rosslee's statement, both in his application and in his Section 204 statement, is his recollection of two persons who were the targets of assassinations, at least two, in one he says two or three, but two we go by the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a>	Secondly, it is very clear that the individual was interrogated.  Thirdly he remembers the reason, the purpose of the interrogation which concerned the second person in his mind, which was also targeted and he referred to some other information that we will get to later, Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a>	Now you happen to have heard some of your fellow applicants on this incident, they deny interrogation.  Suddenly now, you are quite happy to accept that you again are remembering that something did not take place.  I am overstating it, but why would you switch?  Is it simply to protect or assist your fellow applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, it is very simple, where I am sitting today, I do not remember if Mr Bhila was interrogated or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But at the time of your making the statement, Section 204 statement, your memory served you as to indeed an interrogation and also the purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It may so have done, it would appear so, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now if you don't remember it today, on what basis can you even say that you have superimposed something else onto this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, that is what I am saying.  In my mind there might be some confusion between the two incidents on the interrogation aspect of it, there might have been when I made my 204 statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Aren't you actually saying to us that if your fellow applicants, who deny any interrogation, were to be correct, then that may be an explanation for your believing interrogation of Bhila as your confusion of superimposing one incident on another?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, I will repeat myself and say that today I do not remember any interrogation of Mr Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A moment ago you said you cannot remember if he was interrogated or not.  Which is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't remember if he was interrogated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you can't deny that he was interrogated today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can't remember, but two years you did remember, not only that he was interrogated, but what he was asked about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have no reply to that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.  Mr Visser, may I just pursue another line which I think all of your clients have tended often, and that is what would probably have happened.  You often, you too Mr Rosslee, earlier referred to the probabilities of certain lines of development.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a>	Do you think there would probably have been some interrogation if it related indeed also to a second target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I would say if there was a second target that we needed information on, it is likely that he would have been interrogated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And even if you did not need information, would you not have spoken to him in all likelihood about confirming whatever information you had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I should imagine there would have, in that scenario like that, we would have liked to have confirmed, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So, it seems very strange that Bhila would have been held from fairly early morning, through to dark, without anybody talking to him, asking him any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have no recollection of that, I cannot remember if it was done or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, I am asking you your opinion on whether that would have been par for the cause, or sort of normal, or would he have been interrogated, which is the more likely?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I am sure someone spoke to him during the course of the day Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In terms of an interrogation?  Asking questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Asking questions, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You are sure someone would have spoken to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I should imagine someone would have spoken to him Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did you speak to him personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot remember Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> But you were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, I was there.  I cannot remember speaking to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> If you did speak to him, would you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> There are things that I have forgotten from that time, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, it seems that we won't be able to finish with Exhibit B before the short adjournment.  This might be a convenient time to take the short adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, we will take the short adjournment now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">ADRIAN STEVEN ROSSLEE:</span> (still under oath)</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> (continued)   Thank you Mr Chairman.  May I be allowed to interpose to rectify an incorrect statement, which I placed on record when I was speculating a little earlier on before the adjournment.  That regards the people who were discharged from guilt in the Ramlakan case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a>	I was wrong Mr Chairman, Zandile Poshua Ndwandwe, to whom we refer as Zandile, as not an accused in that case.  In fact there were three people that were either found not guilty or discharged.  Accused 1 was Dudu Buthelezi, who was found not guilty at the end of the case.  I am told by my learned friend, Mr Van Schalkwyk who incidentally turns out to have been the Prosecutor in that case, and Bhila and Pumeso were in fact discharged after the close of the State case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> My information is that Zandile was a State witness, number 38 in that case, didn't give evidence?  Bhila Poshua Ndwandwe, on the list page 77, of the indictment is listed as State  witness 38, but she didn't give evidence, she wasn't called, probably refused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, we haven't been privy to a copy of that documentation, and perhaps it might be an idea for the completion of the record, if my learned friend would see his way clear, Mr Prior, to perhaps include that as an Exhibit as well as the judgement of Mr Justice Thirion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a>	Perhaps it might make something clear on the facts Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say you want a copy of the judgement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, Mr Chairman, yes, having said that and having ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, unless there are very serious reasons, I don't see why the Committee should pay for a copy of the judgement.  I say this because what we have been shown by Mr Prior, is the record up to the close of the State case, which is 2 549 pages.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a>	If we then have the eight accused giving evidence, I can image the judgement would run into hundreds of pages.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The judgement is available here Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Perhaps if I may assist Mr Chairman, I've got the judgement here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How long is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> It is two volumes, it is approximately 200 pages.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I withdraw that suggestion Mr Chairman.  I didn't want to make paper for you Mr Chairman, that wasn't the intention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, I will make available the list of State witnesses at the trial.  I do apologise for the record that was put up.  I don't know at what basis Mr Chaskalson has put, but the only relevant pages, the last one where Thirion J, discharges accused 7 and 8, and that was the sole purpose of putting that up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a>	The other information contained in that bundle, is really irrelevant for the purposes of this hearing.  I do apologise for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I understand Mr Chairman.  If I may be permitted then to proceed with Mr Rosslee Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Rosslee, I want to leave the pistol shooting range,but before i do so, just one last aspect in regard to the pistol shooting range, and that appears from page 4 of Exhibit B, where reference is made in paragraph 6 in the following words, "ons het vleis gebraai en so teen sterk skemer het ek", etc.  Is that something which you recall today independently, the fact that you prepared meat while at the pistol shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, to my recollection, we did braai meat there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  All right.  And then that sentence goes on to say and we are now going on to your departure from the pistol shooting range, that yourself, Steve Bosch, McCarter, Wasserman, Mike and Spyker and I take it also Mr Bhila, then got into a Husky bus and you departed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a>	I am not going to go into the Spyker issue again, but other than that, is the information in that paragraph correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And again in paragraph 7, you make the statement that you drove somewhere on directions given and you mentioned Spyker again, but you have already explained that, but on directions at least of Michael Lembede, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You drove off along the South Coast road and then you turned off it seems, please stop me if I am wrong, into the inland, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you, Mr Rosslee, the family or relations of Mr Bhila has directed through their legal representative a request to the applicants, to assist if they can, in determining where the precise spot is that Mr Bhila's body was ejected over the cliff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a>	I want to ask you, do you think that you would be able to find that spot again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, I would be more than happy to assist the family in that matter.  I have been down previously with the Attorney General's Investigation Team and was unable to find the spot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you in fact go out and search for the spot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> We did, we spent a number of days on the South Coast, looking for the spot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just to complete that picture of how you drove, first of all it was at night, and it was dark?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you just turn off the South Coast road and travelled along the road onto which you turned off until you came to the spot or what was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My recollection is that we drove down on a tarred road, and at some point turned off, travelled on a dirt road and I can't remember how many times we turned off or deviated from that road again.  But a number of dirt roads, and a couple of times we turned off roads.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  So you turned off a number of times, that is what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is right, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right.  Spyker Mhieza is very much alive Mr Chairman and I may tell you that he hasn't applied for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>	He is not my client, but that is what I am informed.  Mr Rosslee, let's move straight on to the spot where Mr Bhila was then assassinated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a>	You said in your application at page 25 in the second paragraph, that the area was recognised as an IFP stronghold, do you remember saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was there any particular reason why you made that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I just recall that during the planning or during discussion, while this elimination was being discussed, that it came out that we were going to go to this area, where there had been faction fighting and it was apparently an IFP stronghold.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As far as you know, was that purposefully part of the plan as to how the remains of Mr Bhila had to be disposed of, him being an ANC activist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot recall if that was the specific intention.  I surmise that because of the area being sparsely populated, because of the faction fighting, that is why the area was chosen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry.  Who were present when it was discussed, or it was planned how Mr Bhila was going to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't recall who was present when the planning was done Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did you discuss where you were going to dispose of the body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My recollection is that Lembede would take us to a place that was suitable for the disposal of Mr Bhila's body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Was there any particular reason or did Mr Lembede say why he would choose a particular place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I think the idea Mr Chairman, behind Mr Lembede doing that was, his knowledge of the local area which we didn't have, coming from Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And was Mr McCarter present when that was being discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't recall Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Let me attempt to assist Adv Sigodi by trying to juggle your memory.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a>	When was this planning, when did this planning take place?  The part of the planning that you knew about, and where did it take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I was privy, or I recall being with Major Taylor and Mr McCarter when the order was given, and my recollection is that at the shooting range, Lembede was going to take us to a suitable spot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, no we know that part, we know that the decision was that Lembede had to take you.  I thick Commissioner Sigodi's question relates more to who were present at the time when the issue, if it was ever discussed, of disposing of the body in an IFP stronghold, was discussed, I think that is the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot recall if there was a specific discussion about we are going to an IFP stronghold, to dispose of the body because the deceased was ANC orientated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, but in any event, it makes sense to you that that would be the situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, you said in your Exhibit B that for the purpose of the assassination of Mr Bhila, you took with you on that evening in question, two 6,35 pistols which is the same as .25 pistols, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> According to Mr McCarter - sorry perhaps I should just continue and say that you also stated that you gave Mr McCarter one of those firearms.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My statement, that is yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I am just trying to find it.  In any event, whether it is here or not, you told me that you in fact did give him one of the firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.   And do you still today maintain that that was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Having listened to Mr McCarter's evidence and going back in my mind to the procurement of these, it is possible that I did not give him a pistol at the scene, but that he in fact got it at Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, my Attorney has found the reference, it is over the page, at page 6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a>	Perhaps we should just deal with that aspect straight away.  You say in the second last paragraph, well, perhaps I should just start a little above that, I know one of the others also shot with the other 6.35 pistol, but I cannot remember who it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a>	So what you are saying is that you remember somebody else shooting, but you can't remember that it was, who it was, therefore you cannot remember that it was McCarter.  We now know it was Mr McCarter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct, at that stage, I didn't, or I couldn't recall who had fired as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and chronologically you made Annexure B, the affidavit prior to you completing your amnesty application form, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And at the time when you completed your amnesty application form, you also did not mention Mr McCarter, in fact you didn't even mention the fact that somebody else had also shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Well, that application was made under a lot of time pressure, and for whatever reason, I either forgot or omitted to put Mr - or state that someone else had shot there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Shot, yes all right.  Okay, you arrived at this spot and we know that Mr Bhila is then escorted out of the kombi or the bus, the kombi bus, and taken to the edge of the cliff, is that more or less correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Reference is being made to the fact that his head was covered with a hood of some sort, made of material?  You have heard that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I heard that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Does it accord with your recollection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I do remember Mr Bhila's head being covered, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When was that cover placed over his head?  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't remember when his head was covered Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When you eventually shot Mr Bhila in the head, was his head then covered, or was it not covered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't recall if his head was covered at that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right.  The two 6.35 pistols which you spoke about at page 5 of Exhibit B, had you required them on the day in question in order to effect this assassination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Those weapons I had acquired quite a long time prior to the actual incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You were not in legal possession of those firearms, were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I was not Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What is the reason why you were in possession of those firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> The reason was very much in line with what Mr McCarter has stated, they were used as throw aways.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What is a throw away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It a deniable weapon.  If something would happen and for some reason an informer/agent or something needed a weapon, that could be given to him, or in the case of someone being wrongfully shot, that weapon could be left with that person to make it appear as if they had been armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  That is what you mean by the phrase throw away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right.  Having stopped, I am sorry, perhaps I should just ask you this, was Mr Bhila handcuffed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, Mr Bhila was handcuffed and I recall his hands were cuffed behind his back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right.  Having stopped, taken him out, escorted him, having escorted him to the edge of the cliff, in your own words tell the Committee what transpired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I initially couldn't remember what happened then, but in consultation ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I am sorry, I didn't quite follow what you have just said, you naturally what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I previously couldn't remember in what sequence the events took place, but subsequently learnt that Mr Bhila was made to sit or squad down at the edge of the cliff, whereafter Mr McCarter shot him in the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a>	When he fell down, next to the edge of the cliff, I then shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If you just stop there for a moment.  At page 6 you said the following in Exhibit B, in the middle of the page Mr Chairman.  I think the man was made to lay down at the edge of this cliff.  Why did you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My recollection of when I shot him, was that he was laying down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, well we know that that must have been so in spite of what Mr Bosch says.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a>	Is that the reason why your recollection is that he was made to lay down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, all right.  I don't know whether I asked you this, was he still handcuffed when you shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> He was still handcuffed as I recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were the handcuffs removed after you had shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Visser, may I just interrupt again.  You led the earlier evidence when you asked him what happened, and Mr Rosslee responded that he couldn't remember, but in consultation he learnt that the man was made to sit.  Sorry, I want to know whether he is giving secondhand evidence of his colleagues or is he giving evidence according to his memory?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a>	Please, to please stick to the memory Mr Rosslee.  Let me ask you, when you say in consultation you learnt, did that change your memory or do you simply accept the version of others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I accept what I heard subsequently, supporting or adding to what I remembered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was he made to sit down, or was he made to lay down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I do not remember if he was sitting or laying, I do remember that when I shot him, he was laying down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We have just been given a bundle, shall we call this Exhibit F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, the evidence which is now going to follow, is certainly going to cause a lot of anguish.  Please if you feel that we should take an adjournment, would you please tell me.  I don't want to cause more anguish than is strictly necessary Mr Chairman, but at the end of the day, we are going to have to lead this evidence any way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a>	Perhaps Mr Chairman, it might be an idea just for five minutes, if there could be some consolation, consoling, we might be able to proceed then.  I certainly don't want to give the impression of being insensitive to the emotions of the people concerned.  All right, get it behind us, all right Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a>	We will prefer to go on and get it behind us.  By the time that Mr Bhila was laying on the ground, when you shot him, and I am asking you to speculate in the interest of full disclosure, do you believe that Mr Bhila was already dead or do you believe that he was still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't know Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  All right, now, in your affidavit in support of your application, you made the statement, I then shot the suspect plus minus seven times in the head.  Would you care to explain that please in the light of Mr McCarter's evidence that according to his recollection, you shot him once?  I am sorry and perhaps Mr Chairman, I may immediate tell you that Mr Wasserman who is present, will give evidence and perhaps it is relevant to put this now so that the witness can deal with it, that as far as his recollection goes, you might have shot him the second time, once or twice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a>	So, we've got McCarter saying once, Wasserman is going to say once or twice, and you are saying seven times.  Will you please discuss that issue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, when I put in this application, my recollection was that the pistol had jammed after the first shot and I had cocked it a number of times to clear the jam.  My recollection was that the slide was locked back and I could only surmise or think at that stage that I had emptied the pistol by firing those shots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, let's just make this clear.  Before you shot the first shot, you had the pistol and it had a magazine and it had rounds of ammunition in it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How many rounds of ammunition would that pistol take to fill the magazine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Seven rounds would be standard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  When you had finished, do you have an independent recollection how many rounds were left in the pistol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I can remember clearly that the slide was locked back, in other words the pistol was empty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was empty?  How would the slide of a pistol for those who don't know firearms, be kicked back?  By what impulse is it kicked back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> The last round would kick it back, and the magazine follow, it would come up and lock the slide open.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Is it the recoil of the round of the ammunition that causes the action to move backwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  And is that the best explanation that you can offer today as to why you mentioned seven rounds in your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, yes, as I said I can recall firing the first shot, wracking the slide, or cocking the slide a couple of times.  I have no memory or cannot recall, firing a second shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a>	I do recall the weapon being locked open Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, all right.  Do you recall who threw the body of Mr Bhila over the cliff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot remember who threw the body over the cliff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just interrupt again here, just getting back to your recollection of the pistol having jammed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a>	Share that with us again.  You said it jammed and you had to cock it several times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.  I fired, as I recall, I fired a round, the pistol jammed and I cocked it a number of times to clear the jam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And kept on shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't recall firing another shot after that.  I recall the pistol being locked back, locked open afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you then believe that you had fired all the shots, is that what you are telling us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No.  My assumption would be when the pistol was empty, I don't know how many shots I fired.  I remembered firing one shot and I obviously ejected a number of rounds while trying to clear the jam Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Before going to this spot, did you check how many rounds of ammunition you had in your pistol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot remember actually having checked the magazine, I just know that those pistols carry seven rounds in the magazine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> So you never checked it when you left from the shooting range, you never checked your pistols?</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot remember checking it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Would you ever have carried your pistol around without having it stocked to the full with the rounds of ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That would have been unlikely Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> You can continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was your state of mind during this experience?  Were you cool and collected, calm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I would say that in those circumstances, the emotions were running high.  It is not an everyday situation, it is not a pleasant situation, under stress, under pressure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Rosslee, it was obviously dark?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It was very dark Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was it so dark that you could not observe what was going on if you stood close to people, well close to where Mr Bhila was shot or what was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, as I recall it was very dark and you could see the outlines of the other people, but no detail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You thereafter got in the kombi and left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And according to your Exhibit B it was on the way back, that you had a flat tyre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is the way I remembered it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  You know today that there is a suggestion that you are wrong, and that you had the flat on the way there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, but that is the way that you remember it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just come back to this number of rounds.  Mr Rosslee, you responded to a question of Mr Visser to whether you were calm, your state of mind.  Your response was that in those circumstances, emotions were running high, that it is not a pleasant situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a>	Why would your recollection then have been that you cleared the pistol, why would you have shot a person seven times, if it is not pleasant, and that in the head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, as I said, I don't recall shooting Mr Bhila seven times in the head.  I recall firing the first shot and then the weapon jamming.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, but you also recall your impression that you had emptied the pistol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That the pistol was locked back, and open, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So in other words, you would have continued to fire and cleared your pistol of ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot say, because I cannot remember after firing the first shot, if I fired, after the jam, if I fired more rounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Maybe you are not, maybe you are missing the point that I want to ask.  I find it difficult that one can say I shot him seven times in the head, and at the same time say in a sense emotions were running high, but it was a job to be done, did not take any pleasure in it.  Why seven shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't know if I fired seven shots at him Mr Chairman, that is what I am trying to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, no, you ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I understand what you are saying,, but I didn't say I am just going to empty the pistol into Mr Bhila's head Mr Chairman.  There was no motive to fire seven shots into him at that stage.  I recall firing the one, having it jammed, clearing it and at the end of it, the pistol being locked back and open.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you said, how do you come to recollect many shots if you can remember in both your affidavits, you talk of more than one shot.  Now you say you remember shooting him once, and then you pulled the pistol back to try to clear it.  Why did you, if it is something you dislike doing, something that was so unpleasant, why did you exaggerate it by saying several shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My recollection was that the pistol locked open and the assumption I made Mr Chairman, was that the pistol was empty.  That is normally when the pistol locks open.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you have told us that you, yourself, pulled the - cocked the pistol several times to clear it, not shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is right, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, why did you say in your original affidavit, Exhibit B, that you fired several times, various, I shot the person several times with the pistol in his head.  In your application to us, you say seven times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, as I say, I cannot recollect the exact amount of shots I fired.  I do recall the pistol being open and my assumption was the pistol was empty, and those rounds that hadn't been cocked out while I was trying to clear the jam, had been fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Rosslee, still on this point.  You did not give any indication about the pistol having jammed, that is an important situation.  If you can remember the first shot, you can remember the pistol being cleared of all rounds of ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a>	You get evidence here from other applicants, referring to a jam of the pistol.  Are you not trying to accommodate them, do you really recall the jam, because when you responded to the Chair here, you didn't refer to the jam, you referred to the first shot and it being cleared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, I have no reason to lie here.  One of the reasons I am being here, is to be open and honest.  I am recalling what I remember from that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That is exactly the question, will you please tell us exactly what you really remember, no construction.  Tell us what you remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I remember firing the first round into Mr Bhila, I remember getting a jam.  I remember clearing or wracking the slide a number of times and I remember the slide being locked back and the pistol being empty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If you had indeed cocked it again, and it didn't produce another shot, what would have kicked back the slide?  Does it not respond to the firing of a bullet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> What would have happened, standard operating procedure would be if a jam occurred, to cock the weapon once or twice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> All right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And shoot again, and the moment you pull the trigger, it would go forward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> The slide would operate if there wasn't another jam, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Exactly.  So what would have produced at the end of this exercise a pistol in your hand, with the slide back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> The slide back?  The magazine had to be empty Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, but it will only go back on the basis of a firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Or if it is being cocked, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you are saying you were trying to clear it, and shoot every time, that is your recollection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, not is not what I said Mr Chairman.  I said I fired a shot, I tried to clear the jam and I remember, I don't remember firing a second or a third shot, and I remember the pistol being empty at the end of it.  That is what I recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So it might have had only a single bullet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't know.  I don't recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But when you now said what you do recall is firing the first shot, sliding it back, or cocking it again and remembering it being empty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you remember a jam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I do remember a jam, that is why I would have cocked it after the first shot Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If it didn't cock itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Mr Rosslee, who told you to shoot Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't know if I was told to shoot Mr Bhila, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Did you just shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't know if I was told, or if I did it purely because I knew we were there to eliminate Mr Bhila.  I don't know if someone said to me shoot or fire or whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> When you left the shooting range, did you know that you were one of the people who were going to shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Well, I had a weapon in my possession, one of these throw away weapons, so yes, I must have known that I would probably be involved in the shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may have just pushed yourself forward and started shooting, without having been ordered to do so by anybody, is that what you are telling us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't know Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Rosslee, we have unfortunately before us only a reference to this specific application that we are hearing you, we have only an extract from your application before us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a>	I understand that there are also other incidents for which you have applied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> There is one other incident Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Does that incident relate to the shooting of any individual?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Rosslee, at the bottom of the page, page 6, of Exhibit B, you refer to what happened eventually, to the two firearms that you referred to earlier and you say that you handed them in to the South African Police during the second amnesty for illegally or unauthorised firearms in terms of the then existing legislation in that regard, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> This happened when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I think it was the second firearm amnesty that was held Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you remember the date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't recall off hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You say in Exhibit B, 1991/1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Well, that was possibly when it was then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What would normally happen to those firearms that are handed in in terms of amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Those firearms, my understanding is that those firearms would be destroyed.  In instances people have applied for licences for weapons they hand in.  I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr McCarter gave evidence to say that it was himself and Mr Lembede, who threw the body over the cliff.  MR MALAN:   Sorry Mr Visser for interrupting, let me just got to this.  Mr Rosslee, why did you retain those weapons long after you have left Vlakplaas and the employ of the South African Police, if it was stock issued to you by Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That was not stock issued to us at Vlakplaas Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Where did you get those weapons from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I procured those weapons because they were weapons that were going to be destroyed, at the Quartermaster's stores.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That had been confiscated and were to be destroyed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where was it that you got them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> From the old Quartermaster, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Where was that, at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And when was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't recall when that was, but it must have been prior to the incident with Mr Bhila, quite a while prior as I recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How did you manage to get hold of that, why would it be given to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> The weapons were to be destroyed, and I had a contact, since deceased, who worked there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who was that contact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't recall the person's name, it was a Lieutenant that worked in the section where they destroyed those firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why would Mr McCarter have given evidence that these were given to you at Vlakplaas, at least given to him at Vlakplaas, that he didn't get it from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My explanation would be that I brought them from Quartermaster's and they were dished out at Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> By whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I wouldn't, I can't recall who handed them out.  Some might - Mr De Kock might have given some out, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So, did you not get those pistols for your own use, but for the use of Vlakplaas generally, did it go into the arsenal of Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My recollection is that a number of members got some of those weapons, Mr Chairman.  I don't know if there were left, that were kept in the armoury, or what happened to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How many weapons did you procure from this since deceased Lieutenant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I would have to guess and say in the region of 12 or 14, something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he know that you were working at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> He did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he know what purpose you wanted it for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> He knew they were going to be used as throw away weapons, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Is it possible to find out what the name of that Lieutenant was?  If he was a contact, a person that you did know at that time, surely somehow you would be able to get to his name again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I could possibly make enquiries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why were you interested in getting throw away weapons?  You have told us as I recollect your evidence, that throw away weapons were used if you shot someone who was unarmed, to leave it on the body to make it look as if he had been armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you anticipating that you would be shooting unarmed men and needed throw away weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No Mr Chairman, it was a case of see why, cover your arse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Hm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It was an preventative measure, not a preventative measure, but ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, preventative of what, shooting unarmed men, that is one of the examples of the two examples you gave us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.  In circumstances and I am sure any Police Force in the world has seen it, innocent people or bystanders sometimes get shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you were planning to protect yourself against being found out if you shot innocent people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> If it so happened, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Rosslee, you are giving this evidence as if it is par for the cause for all members of the Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Not at all Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So why did you procure these weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Exactly the reason I stated Mr Chairman, they were procured as throw away weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But why would you do that and not another member of the Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you have any intention or expectation of shooting people illegally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I didn't Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But as a Sergeant, you thought you should provide them to the other members of Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> There was an opportunity as I recall, to get these weapons Mr Chairman.  I got them and handed them out for whatever use anybody was going to use them.  My purpose for having them, was as a throw away weapon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and that is what alarms me that members of the Police Force should be anticipating  that they would need weapons for the purposes you have told us, that you should think necessary to arm yourself with two of them, and provide them for other members at Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, the circumstances then were a lot different from what they are now, and we travelled in dangerous places in those times, and anything could have happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but if it was dangerous, the people would be armed and you would be entitled to use your weapons.  The throw away weapon you have told us, was where you shot an unarmed person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, that was one of the eventualities that it could be used for, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Give us another Mr Rosslee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> One of the others I stated was we would have agents or informers and those weapons would sometimes be given to them, when they infiltrated purely as a backup or a last ditch weapon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, but that is not as a throw away then, that was for a specific purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That would be for a specific purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That is where you wouldn't otherwise be able to legally acquire a weapon and you think that you needed to protect an informer or an agent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That would be so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Or provide him with some protection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Give us another example of what you would need a throw away weapon for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Another reason for having one of those weapons would be to plant it on somebody, to implicate somebody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Are you saying to us that you went into the Police Force, to act indiscriminately whether it was legal or illegal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, I think my evidence from the beginning has been that I definitely didn't go into the Force to act illegally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So at some stage, that became quite acceptable to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, it was not acceptable, but considering what has happening at that time, I was protecting myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You referred now when you were responding to these last rounds of questions, to the two weapons, but you earlier said that you procured some 12 or more weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What would they have been for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> As I said, I handed them out.  Either gave them to  someone at Vlakplaas that handed them out, I might have given some of them to some ex-colleagues at Vlakplaas for whatever use they saw fir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was there any central arsenal to which you contributed those weapons and deposited it there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Not that I can recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you simply got 12 weapons and you dished them out to whoever of your colleagues would have use of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What were you telling them when you were handing them these weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't recall what I said to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Just walked up to someone and said pal, here is a weapon, a throw away or use it for an informer or whatever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Like I said, I don't remember what I said to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you did that on your own, without authority from any of your senior officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, I arranged for those weapons on my own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did they know, your senior officers, that you were going about this way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I should imagine someone knew.  If a number of people at Vlakplaas had weapons like that, someone must have known about that.  I cannot for certain say that they had knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Rosslee, was it acceptable at Vlakplaas that anyone and everyone could do his own thing?  Because clearly in this instance, this is what you have been doing with the weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, it wasn't acceptable Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you were acting outside of orders and certainly not with the consent at that stage, or authority given to you by your superiors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> As I recall, no, I didn't get authority or no one consented to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If this was the practice, why would you have assumed orders to have been there and authority whenever actions were ordered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> As I said earlier Mr Chairman, I know for a fact that on previous occasions, feedback and authority for actions were asked from Vlakplaas, so I assumed that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you didn't ask any authority on these weapons and you did not give any feedback.  You simply dished them out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is my recollection Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now how does that tally with the disciplined approach of orders and feedback that you talk about in general terms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It doesn't tally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Any explanation for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> None whatsoever Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Rosslee, when these unauthorised weapons were required, can you remember who the Commanding Officer at Vlakplaas was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> At that time it was Major De Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was he unaware of the possession of these firearms by you and other members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot remember if he was aware of us being in possession of them, or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Because Mr McCarter seems to recall that they were handed out at Vlakplaas and I think and I don't want to say, lay words in his mouth, but I seem to recall that he said it was handed out by Mr Eugene de Kock.  Would that be incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It is not inconceivable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, that is completely contrary to what this witness has said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is what I am putting to him now Mr Chairman, that that is indeed, that is an opposition to the evidence that he has just given.  What do you say, are you correct or is Mr McCarter correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> If Mr McCarter says that he received the weapon from Mr De Kock, I would have to concede that point.  I know that I acquired the weapons, I took them to Vlakplaas and I handed them out to some people.  I don't know if there were weapons left that got handed out to other people or what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Rosslee, why if you have a recollection that you handed him the pistol, and he says something else that he got it from De Kock, why must you concede that he is correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I do not, in my statement I said that I had handed him the pistol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> All right, I cannot now sitting here say that I can recollect giving him the pistol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But why must you concede the correctness of his evidence, that is my question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I am just saying that in likelihood my remembering bringing the weapons to Vlakplaas, it is very possible that Mr De Kock had given him a weapon there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Isn't it possible that McCarter was lying to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You made a statement on oath, saying you handed the weapons to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why do you now say it might be that I was wrong?  How could you make a statement on oath like that?  You didn't say you weren't sure, you said you did it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, right now where I am sitting here, I cannot remember handing that firearm to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I may be wrong in what I am going to say right now Mr Chairman, I am checking it, but I seem to recall Mr Chairman, that the evidence that Mr Rosslee gave to you, that he gave one of the firearms to McCarter was told to me in consultation, and doesn't appear from the documents, but I may be wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a>	I think that that is where it comes from Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He also says it in the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I have been looking for it Mr Chairman, and I couldn't find it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> We will check on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> On page 6, where he says I think one of the others shot with the other pistol.  By inference means that it was one of the two pistols that he refers to and this is why we covered that in consultation, and that is why I placed that evidence before you, so that you can be aware of that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a>	He doesn't specifically say anywhere, that he gave the other firearm to McCarter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He says it on page 5 in the middle, for these purposes I had two 6.35 pistols which I have already had for a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, reading that together with what is on page 6, the inference is irresistible that one of the two was given to the other person, but that is why we consulted with the witness and we placed it in the interest of full disclosure, before you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And later given back to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because he goes straight on to say that the two pistols were then ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You are absolutely correct Mr Chairman, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There is only one inference one could draw from Exhibit B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is the point I am trying to make Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, we have no further evidence to lead from this witness, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, Rossouw on record.  Mr Rosslee, you have testified that you have not recollection that you were present when Mr Bhila was transferred from one group of people, to another, the so-called interception, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> At that time, can you remember whom you were travelling with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I can't Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> You won't be able to say whether you travelled with Mr McCarter and Mr Bosch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I wouldn't be able to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> In another vehicle perhaps?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> I am trying to find out, because you have heard that Mr Bosch's evidence was that he also can't remember that aspect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.  I just - I don't remember meeting another vehicle or being with when Mr Bhila was picked up or handed over or anything like that.  I don't remember any aspect of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Can you recall whether you arrived at the shooting range with Mr Bhila or did he arrive at a later stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Right now, if my recollection is correct, Mr Bhila arrived later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> So it is possible that there were more than one vehicle, that people were travelling in different vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Now, I would like to have you assistance in trying to establish why you similar to Mr Bosch, had the recollection that both Mr Lembede and Mr Mhieza was present throughout the operation.  I have heard your explanation that you have also made the inference because they were working together, closely together in Natal, and that is why you have also linked them in your affidavit, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct, and that is the only explanation I have at this stage Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Yesterday you have heard Mr Bosch was also cross-examined on this point, and he also gave the same testimony that these two people worked closely together and that might be a reason, but he also stated that in his mind, his recollection, his independent recollection, was that they were both present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot say the same now Mr Chairman, I cannot clearly recollect that Mhieza was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> What do you mean by saying you cannot clearly recollect that Mhieza was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I do not remember as I am sitting here now, that Mhieza was present there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> All right.  Let me then ask you about the  - when your statement was taken down, Exhibit B, by Mr Holmes, you have testified that you were confronted please help me, I might be wrong, I am not sure about this, you were confronted with the statement of Mr Bosch.  Was that your testimony?</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Were you shown Mr Bosch's statement, the written statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, it was held out in front of me and said, we've already got a statement from Mr Bosch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Were you shown the paragraphs in it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot remember actually reading the statement, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Was it a written statement or a typed statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> You see, why I am asking, I am trying to find out you know, the sequence in which the Investigating Unit of the Attorney General, went about its business, because and in all fairness to you, I am not sure and I don't have an instruction at this point, whether there was another statement or an earlier statement, but in bundle 1 Bhila, you will see an extract from a statement that Mr Bosch made to the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a>	You will find that on pages 8 - 10, this is the typed statement, which I assume would be a typed version of a written statement, but it is dated on page 10, 18 November 1996, whereas your statement is dated April 1996, 12 April 1996, that is some seven months earlier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have no explanation for that.  I just know that I was shown a statement by Mr Bosch, or allegedly by Mr Bosch at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> There is no other explanation that you can give, I am trying to find out because it seems to me that in that respect your versions, were identical.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't know.  Like I say, I was shown - or what was shown to me was a statement, apparently a statement by Mr Bosch and they said they've got this statement, I need to cooperate, whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Well, let me ask you this, did Mr Holmes  or anybody else perhaps put to you that this is what Mr Bosch said, not showed you a statement, but put it to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I was shown a statement, one was held in front of me or held out, shown to me, and during the time that my statement was taken, there were things put to me that Mr Bosch says X, Y, Z, do you agree, do you disagree, whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Thank you.  Then you have testified that - let's first go to the shooting range, you said that your recollection is that you did hold a braai there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> You have heard the testimony and I am just putting it to you that Mr Bosch testified that he can't remember on a question what arrangements were made for lunch, he said he cannot remember, he thinks that somebody went to buy some cold drinks.  Can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I remember that statement of his, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Do you remember that somebody left to buy cold drinks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Not specifically, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Who made the arrangements to have a braai there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> We know now that Mr Bosch, you have also confirmed that Mr Bosch was not present when the instruction came or the request from Mr Taylor, that is correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Thereafter, can you remember a discussion that you were part of, where a planning took place, specifically where Mr Bhila would be shot, who would do the shooting, what weapons would be used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot specifically remember that discussion, or a discussion like that taking place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Would you agree with me that it would be likely that if such a discussion did take place, you would be present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I would have to say yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> You see Mr Bosch's testimony is that he can't remember such a discussion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, I think it is just unlikely that being a member of the team, he wouldn't be privy to a discussion like that.  I don't specifically remember a discussion like that, but if he is part of the team, I would say if there was a discussion like that, he would have been privy to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Is it also not true that Mr Bosch was and his testimony was yesterday, that he was not working in this area.  He doesn't know, and he can't give a reason why he was specifically brought into this operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It is quite correct, Mr Bosch didn't work down here as often as Mr McCarter and I did.  I don't have an explanation for him being down here at that specific time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Did you have a discussion with him, not in a group, personally?  Did you have a discussion with him about the planned operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Not that I can recall Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> So you didn't inform him at any time that Mr bila was going to be shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I said I cannot recall if I did or if I did not.  I just have no recollection of speaking to him about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Are you then saying it is possible you might have spoken to him about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It is possible I might have spoken to him about it, I don't remember doing it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> At the time when you were waiting at the shooting range, what were you doing there the whole day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have no idea, I cannot remember what we did there the whole day bar me remembering that we had a braai.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Mr Bosch said that you did nothing but wait.  Would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I honestly don't know.  I honestly don't know, I cannot remember what else happened there that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Were there at the shooting range, apart from Mr Bosch, Mr Wasserman, Mr Taylor who apparently arrived at a later stage, and Mr McCarter and Mr Lembede, and of course Mr Bhila, were there any other people present that you can recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't remember if there were some of the askaris there or if there were other people present at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Is it possible that there might have been other people present there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> There may have been other people present, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Would a discussion about a planned assassination take place in the presence of such people, would you involve askaris in such a plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My assumption would be that it would be spoken about in private, to one side or in one of the vehicles or something, and not in front of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Yes.  You would like to handle this operation on a need to know basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> It is possible that as Mr Bosch testified, that such a discussion did not, or he can't recall that such a discussion took place at the shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It is possible, because I don't remember a discussion like that either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Now, on the way, when you left there, on the way to the area where the assassination took place, was there any discussion in the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot remember any discussion going on in the kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> You see Mr Bosch testified that you drove in silence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Would you not agree that you would not, well, it is unlikely that you would sit in the company of a person, discussing how you are going to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I would say it is unlikely we would have done that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Yes.  Now, when you got out of the vehicle and you moved towards the edge of the cliff, you said that - you were asked about whether Mr Bhila was made to sit down or lay down.  Am I correct in recalling your testimony that you can't remember whether he was made to sit down or lay down, but at the time when you shot him, he was laying down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> So you won't be able to dispute Mr Bosch's testimony that he was made to sit down initially?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I can't.  I recall him laying down when I shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Can you remember a discussion between Mr McCarter and Mr Bosch afterwards, after the incident where the details and reasons for this operation, was furnished to Mr Bosch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I don't remember a discussion like that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> At the time when you were at the shooting range, can you recall anybody mentioning that to any of the people there, not only Mr Bosch, but to the other people you are saying might also have been there, mentioning to them that the person that is being held captive there, is an ANC terrorist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have no recollection of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> And then lastly, Mr Rosslee, you said that you can't give an indication as to whether Mr Bhila, at the time that he was kept at the shooting range, was handcuffed or whether he had foot shackles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct, I cannot specifically remember, but taking the circumstances, I am sure he must have been secured in some way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> So you won't be able to dispute the testimony of Mr Bosch that he was, he had foot shackles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I can't dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUSSOUW:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR ROUSSOUW</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, Van Schalkwyk for McCarter and others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a>	Mr Rosslee, during the course of your evidence in chief, you referred extensively to Exhibit B, the statement you have made to Holmes, and my learned colleague has just put to you that this statement was made on the 12th of April 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a>	Just to put it in context, was that before you actually applied for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> The amnesty application was filed, if you will bear with me Mr Chairman, just thereafter if I am not mistaken, the next day, the 13th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> December of 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> 13th of December, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did Holmes consult you on his own, or was there anyone else present at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> As I remember, Brigadier Human was present, Captain Holmes and another Investigator.  But when the statement was being taken, if I remember correctly, it was just Captain Holmes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Was the idea that you were to make a statement so that you could be used as a witness so to speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Well, that was what was told to me, with regards to the 204, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Were you all along under the impression that you would have been a witness in a criminal matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did the Investigator of the Attorney General's office, Holmes or anyone at any particular stage, advise you to apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No one Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> And at the time that you made the amnesty application, did you have a copy of this particular statement, Exhibit B with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> None whatsoever, I only received this statement I think it was a week ago, when I was in consultation with senior counsel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> As far as your recollection of the events are concerned, would it be correct to say that the only aide-memoire assistance you really have is this statement, Exhibit B and your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That would be correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> There are no notes that you have made, no entry in any pocket book, any register, nothing of that sort of course?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Nothing that I have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> You have or it has been supplied on your behalf, three reports from clinical psychologists and psychiatrists, Exhibit C1 - C3.  I do not intend to go into detail with that, but may I just ask you have you at any particular point experienced loss of memory, either short term or long term, one would refer to it as memory gaps?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Blackouts, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> And do you experience in everyday life, that there are some of the things in the past, maybe the recent past or the distant past, that you cannot remember on any particular occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I do have memory lapses about events, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Incidentally at the time when you made the statement to Holmes and others, were you under treatment at that particular point in time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> You made it on the 12th of April 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't recall, I don't think I was having treatment at that stage yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Now, if we may just deal then with two of my other clients, Mr Ngadi and Mr Mhieza, you have not mentioned either in Exhibit B or in your application or in your evidence here in chief or in cross-examination thus far, the presence of any person by the name of Aubrey Ngadi.  May I just ask you, did you know a person by the name of Aubrey Ngadi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't recall his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> And as far as you recall, he was not present on this particular incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot put him there, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Right.  You had sight of the S&amp;T form being referred to here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> And do you agree with me that there is no S&amp;T form for any Aubrey Ngadi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I would have to take your word for that, because I don't recall whose names were on those S&amp;T forms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> All right.  I am going to suggest to you that in so far as had been mentioned, albeit on the side line by Mr Bosch, that there was a Sergeant Aubrey Ngadi, my instructions are that he was certainly not involved in this at all.  He was not there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I would have to concede to that, I don't remember the name and I don't remember him being at the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did Holmes, when you made Exhibit B at any stage suggest to you who else were present on the day in question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, as we went along in the statement, as I recall he would say was X or was Y there or who else was there, whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> And how did the name Spyker Mhieza come up for the first time, was it something that you had mentioned out of your own, or was it something that was suggested to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot recall how it came up the first time.  It might have been just from the general discussion about us operating in Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> By that token, could it have been that Holmes have mentioned Spyker Mhieza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It is possible, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> All right.  As you think back here today, do I understand your evidence correctly that there is a vagueness in your memory as to as you sit here today, as to whether or not Mhieza could have been present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Most definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> My instructions from Mhieza is that he was not present and he did not take any part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It is quite possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> All right.  Now let us just deal with the reporting back.  You would remember that you were asked about the whole system of reporting back, whether it be in general or in this specific case, instance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a>	Let's deal with it in general.  Was it your experience that a reporting back was done between your Commanding Officers at Vlakplaas and the Commanding Officers of the Units to which you would be called to render assistance, ie in Port Natal division, there would have been report back between Taylor and De Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> At that level, yes.  I believe there would have been report back there, but from more and likely than from the Vlakplaas people on the ground, the Head of the Unit operating in a division, would give feedback.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> All right, you were not one of those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Would it certainly accord with your experience of how things worked, the line of command or the chain of command that the Officer, the local guy who had enlisted your assistance, that he would have to report back also to your Commander at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, I would have to concede that there would be contact at that level, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I know, please Mr Rosslee, don't concede.  Your question was, what is your knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My knowledge is there was contact at that level Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You made it quite clear that the local Unit going down to Natal, would have had to give feedback, to report to the Commander at Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> As far as your response to the question about Captain Taylor reporting to De Kock, you say it not to emphatically, you simply say there would have been but you have no knowledge of such feedback?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I know there was contact there.  If it was specific feedback or reporting back, that I cannot stipulate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, but clearly there was contact in the sense that the request would have come to Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But as to the activities of the Unit coming down, why do you say that there would have been a report back of the Unit's activities by Taylor to Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is not what I said Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You see, I just wanted to get clarity in my mind on that because I think that is where the question led to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Mr Malan, with respect not, I asked on a general level simply.  You confirm that it was your evidence that in this particular case, you don't know anything about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Yes, right.  It was simply put on that level sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a>	Right, as far as the discussions were concerned, and you would remember that you were asked as to the names of the two people that were mentioned, involved in the trial, do I have your evidence correct, that you can't specifically remember the names that was mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I couldn't remember the names until Captain Holmes, or the name, the deceased's name, until Captain Holmes actually showed me or told me what his name was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Do you confirm that you in any event, neither yourself nor McCarter were ever involved as far as you know, in any matter regarding Pumeso (indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have no knowledge of that name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Right, I would like to discuss with you the form of the order.  You would remember that yesterday with McCarter, the whole aspect of the order was discussed, whether it was a request or an order or a command as in the normal sense of a military command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a>	Would you care to elaborate as to what sort of form the order took in this particular case and maybe in general.  Let's start with this particular case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My recollection is that Major Taylor requested, after giving us the background to Mr Bhila, requested us to eliminate him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Right.  How did you perceive this request, as what?  Was it simply a request that you could deny or that you could decline to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Well, given the background that he had given us, and the type of person Major Taylor was, well respected and everything else, I wouldn't have declined it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did you, yourself, and I know you can't speak for McCarter, but from what you observed, did you regard that request as an order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Did you regard yourself to be bound by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Most definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Now, if the Commission will bear with me for a moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If you are not pursuing that, let me ask the question again, because I asked it earlier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a>	Earlier you gave evidence that such orders had to be cleared with Vlakplaas command, so why would you obey and implement a request which you perceived to be an order that you believe you were definitely bound by it, without referring it to Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> The only answer I can give to that is if Major Taylor was issuing that order to us, it had been cleared already.  I wouldn't be privy to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No please Mr Rosslee, that wasn't your evidence earlier.  You said if you would have had any orders from the local branch where you were on routine duties, you had to clear that and would have cleared that with the command at Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> If I remember correctly Mr Chairman, I said that standard operating procedures would have been that it had to be cleared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Exactly, standard operating procedures.  Now, why do you say if that was not done, without those procedures, why would you have believed yourself to be bound by the order simply of Taylor without confirmation at the level of Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Number one is, I might not have been privy at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, that is not the question, the question relates only to whether you were compelled to implement at the level of Taylor giving the order or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It is very simple Mr Chairman, he is an Officer and I was obeying an order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, if I may interrupt you, just a moment please. Mr Chairman, may I interrupt, I don't often do this, but in this case with all due respect, the question is not based on the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a>	The evidence of Mr Rosslee is quite explicit, in reply to questions by Mr Malan that normal procedure would have been that there would have been prior authorization.  That is the point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a>	He now says Mr Chairman, that I regarded the request as an order.  He is now asked but how could you have regarded it as an order if there wasn't confirmation.  Confirmation would have been prior to that Mr Chairman, and that is in line with his evidence and that is the only issue which I want to put straight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> My recollection is that they would check back with Vlakplaas if they were given orders down here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The evidence was at that stage very specific Mr Visser, and we can get back to the record if we have to, but we can leave it at the moment, I just want to put to you that my understanding at the time was very clearly, an order of this nature, given by Taylor, had to be cleared, and I am using these words, because this was my question, by Vlakplaas, at the level of Vlakplaas, before implementation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is the point I am trying to make, so we are in agreement Mr Chairman, yes, that is precisely the point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a>	It was prior, so putting to this witness that he would not have executed the order unless he knew that thereafter, before he executed the order, there would have been authorization Mr Chairman, maybe unfair to him, that is the only point I am making.  He was saying that, and remember he wasn't the leader of the squad, McCarter was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a>	The question, if anything should be, why didn't you make sure that McCarter didn't get instructions.  Perhaps that may be a fair question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I don't want to ask whether he would make sure or not.  The question was, Mr Rosslee's evidence or response to the question here was, that when Andy Taylor requested them to eliminate Bhila, that was an order, immediately, to which he was bound.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I follow Mr Chairman, and that is fair enough.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now, my follow up is would you not only have been bound once the order of Taylor had been cleared at the level of Vlakplaas, that is the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I considered myself bound Mr Chairman, because number one, Major Taylor was a senior officer giving us the order, that is number one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a>	Number two is, I have no doubt that it would have been cleared or referred back to Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> By McCarter or by Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Either one of the two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Well, if it is Taylor, I mean there is no check if Taylor would have cleared it at the level of Vlakplaas, so really it is the Unit that had to confirm the order at Vlakplaas, that is how I understood the evidence earlier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is in most cases, on a day to day basis, it would be the Section Commander of Vlakplaas on the ground, that would go back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Exactly, and then before implementation you get this request, you are present when the request is made or the order is given.  Did you ever ask McCarter did you clear this at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't remember Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You don't remember having asked him that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You knew quite clearly didn't you, that this order was an illegal order?  It was an order to murder somebody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> We understood that elimination, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you didn't bother to check with Taylor if he had cleared it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I hadn't Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And if I understand you correctly, this was the only incident where you were involved in the illegal killing or assassination of an activist at that level?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No Mr Chairman, that is not what he said.  The question was whether he shot a person in the other incident and he said no, he didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> All right, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> There was another application for amnesty which in fact an elimination was ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I understood that answer incorrectly, thank you for showing me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> May I proceed Mr Chairman.  Mr Rosslee, let us just ask one or two more questions about this order.  You can't say whether there was any communication obviously between Taylor and Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I cannot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Taylor did not mention to you as far as your recollection goes, that he had cleared this with Vlakplaas specifically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't recall him saying anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Perhaps we must just put the whole matter in context again.  The Unit of which Major Taylor as he then was, down here, was the Commanding Officer, was that C-Section of the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Is that exactly the same section as Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Similar anti-terrorist section, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Also referred to as C-Section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Would Major Taylor then have been a senior officer in the same section as you people were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Work in the same desk, most definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> All right.  In so far as there had been suggestions that, or evidence might be forthcoming, that Mr De Kock was on that particular point in time, on leave, would you tell us who the second in command was of Vlakplaas at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I can't recall who the 2-IC was at that specific stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Okay.  You were asked about the questioning at the old shooting range.  If I may just ask you a few questions about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a>	Is it your recollection that there was not an interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> As I said earlier, I cannot remember where I am sitting here now, that the deceased was interrogated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Thinking back, this particular location, did that have facilities for interrogation where one could do proper questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> As I recall, the one side was open, open fencing.  I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> But there was certainly no formal questioning session, notes taken, that sort of thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Not that I can recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you suggesting that these people used formal questioning sessions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> I will get to that Mr Chairman.  You are aware of the fact that at the time, there was a thing such as a Section 29 questioning in terms of the Internal Security Act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Yes, just answer.  I want to ask you this, on this level, would there have been any purpose to have questioned a man because he has already gone through the whole Section 29 procedure, the formal questioning, the interrogation leading to the trial, etc?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I doubt that there would have been very much point in interrogating him again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN SCHALKWYK:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VAN SCHALKWYK</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But the questioning that you referred to, was finding out the address of his friend, wasn't it, no formal interrogation at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is what my recollection was when I made the statement Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Mr Chairman, I see it is about one o'clock, may I start?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think it will be fair to start you for two minutes.  We will take the adjournment now till two o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">ADRIAN STEVEN ROSSLEE:</span> (still under oath)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR HUGO:</span> Mr Rosslee, you were only at Vlakplaas for approximately a year, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I think it was just short of a year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And would you say that you became au fait with the rules and the regulations and the structures that were in place pertaining to the reporting back and the receiving of requests of various divisions all over the country, to Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I would say I had a general working knowledge of it, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now, let's just get it clear, as far as Mr De Kock's knowledge is pertaining to this particular incident, is concerned.  Is it your evidence that Mr De Kock didn't know about this incident, as far as you can recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My recollection when I made the statement Mr Chairman, was that we had been tasked to come down to Port Natal, by Mr De Kock.  In the light of the other evidence that Mr De Kock was on leave, I would have to concede that that was the point, he in fact didn't know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, Mr De Kock says that he didn't give the instructions for the group to travel down to Durban and he confirms in fact, that he was on leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Is it also true then that when you received the instruction from Major Taylor, I think as he was at the time, that you didn't, you personally didn't liaise with Mr De Kock whether he was on leave or not, to get his approval?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And is it also then your evidence that you did not report to Mr De Kock after the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And I think you must have heard yesterday when I put it to Mr McCarter that this particular operation, was carried out without the knowledge of Mr De Kock and he wasn't even notified of this operation after it had been finalised and carried out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> In the light of the evidence that has been led, I would accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now, as far as the reporting structures are concerned, let me just put it to you that your perception of how that were used, is not correct.  Mr De Kock says and we have had various other amnesty applications that dealt with this particular issue, that the arrangement was that whenever a Unit for instance from Cape Town or Durban, needed the services of the askaris or a Vlakplaas contingent, that they would not contact Mr De Kock directly, but that Mr De Kock's Section Head at that particular point in time, I think his rank at the time was Brigadier Schoon, would then be contacted and be told that the services of Vlakplaas are needed.  He would then in turn liaise with Mr De Kock and Mr De Kock would then arrange for Vlakplaas members to be sent down to wherever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a>	Have you been aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, what did you say, yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And the arrangement was further that whenever something cropped up whilst members of Vlakplaas were under the command of say for instance Mr Taylor, that Mr Taylor would take a decision here, locally, in conjunction with his Officer Commanding and that his Officer Commanding would most probably liaise with Brigadier Schoon, and they would then approve the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a>	Were you ever told by Mr Taylor that he had tried to contact Mr De Kock prior to the occurrence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Not to my recollection, no Mr Chairman, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Then there is just one other aspect, we have been able to contact Mr De Kock, we had some logistical difficulty in getting instructions from him, but he says pertaining to the weapons, that he wasn't aware of the fact that you had them and you never told him about the fact that they were used in an operation or that they were in your possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Like I said earlier, I wasn't aware if he knew or didn't know about the existence of the weapons, and I personally didn't report back to him about the use of those weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And, just finally, when Mr De Kock says that he had only been informed about this incident by the Attorney General approximately a year ago, would that accord with your experience and your knowledge in the sense that you didn't tell him about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Definitely.  As I said, I didn't give him any feedback on the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR HUGO</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Rosslee, most of what I wanted to cover with you, has been covered by the avid questioning of the members of the Commission, but I would like to pose a few questions to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a>	Coming to what I can call your political indoctrination, you say that you believed that every black person, was a potential MK member, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And all MK members, according to you, were terrorists, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> MK members, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> So your belief was that every black man was a potential terrorist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Potentially yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Old women, young women and black children, were all potential terrorists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> You said just now any black man, potential terrorists, I would say within what would be regarded as the right ages, yes.  Not all women, all children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Would you regard that as a political belief or racism, simple racism?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I would say based on what was occurring then, it was a political belief Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Coming to Captain Holmes, you say he pressured you to make a statement, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And the only way he pressured you was to put in front of you, the statement of Mr Bosch and then ask you questions and write them down, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, that is not correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> What other pressure did he exert on you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Pressure of being arrested and incarcerated for the murder of Mr Bhila if I didn't cooperate with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And in the same breath, he told you that if you made a statement, you would turn a State witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did that relieve you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It was my only way out at that stage Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It was my only way out of the predicament at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes, that promise that you would be made a State witness, did it relieve you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, like I said, it was my only way out at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And that promise was made before a statement could be taken to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> So when you wrote the statement, you were relieved, you were no longer pressured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't think the stress goes away Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And in Mr Bosch's statement, did you read anything where Mr Bosch said that he could point out the place where the body of Bhila was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, as I said, I don't recall and I don't think that I read Mr Bosch's statement, that it was shown to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Were you ever asked, or was it ever put to you that Mr Bosch had indicated that he could point out the body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Not to my recollection Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But in your statement, you say that you could - you thought at that time, that you could point out where the body was, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman, could I just get a reference, a page number?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> It is page 7, paragraph 2.  You said possibly you could point out the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct, I did say that in my statement, and I went with the Attorney General's Investigators to the South Coast in an attempt to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes.  Is it your evidence that at that time, you believed that you could point out the place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I believed at that time, as I do now, that there were cliffs and due to that, I would be able to point out the place.  I was proven wrong when I came down with the Attorney General's people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And when you went to that place, where Mr Bhila was killed, did you carry a torch or something in order for you to see that place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I do not remember there being any torches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Were you directed by either Mr Lembede or Mr Mhieza to that place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> As I had said in my earlier evidence, I believe whoever the member was who was with us, he took us there, so he wouldn't have given us directions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you gain the impression that whoever pointed out that place, he knew that place very well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Well, he obviously knew the area, or must have known the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you not enquire whether it was safe to carry this dirty operation at that place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Sorry, I didn't quite hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Did you ever enquire whether it was safe to kill someone at that place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I just went on the assumption that being local, a person would know a suitable place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You didn't even ask whether some other people had been killed and thrown at that cliff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Now, let's come to Mhieza now.  I want you to come out clear, was Mhieza involved in this operation, was he there or you can't recall whether he was there?  You can't state as a fact whether he was there, or he was not there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot now remember if Mhieza was present during that operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But if someone were to say that Mhieza was present, you wouldn't deny that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't remember him being there, if somebody else remembers him being there, it will be my word against his and vice versa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> No, no, it can't be your word against his, you say you can't remember.  My question is if someone were to positively say that Mhieza was there, because you can't recall, you won't be in a position to deny that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I won't be able to deny that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> At the shooting range, that is at the risk of using a misnomer, where you waited for Bhila to be transported, did you see Bhila coming there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot as I am sitting here, remember Bhila arriving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But do you remember when Bhila was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> He was there during the day, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Was he injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Was he naked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have no recollection if he was dressed or naked Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> What of him do you remember as you were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't remember anything of him Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> When he was shot at the cliff, was he shot on his foot, on his head or on his body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> He was shot in the head Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But you say you can't recall whether he was interrogated or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> At the shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My recollection was that I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> When the statement of Mr Bosch was read to you by Captain Holmes, can you recall whether it did state that Mr Bhila was interrogated at the shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't remember what Mr Bosch said in his statement, about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> What you put in your statement, Exhibit B, that he was interrogated, can you account for that, whether it was out of your own volition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot, as I said earlier, the only explanation I have for that is that I have probably superimposed the other application, amnesty application with this one, because from evidence, there apparently wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You were saying that you had evidence yesterday, and is it your evidence that you consulted with your co-applicants after the evidence was led yesterday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> We spoke, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And did you discuss about the interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't believe we spoke about the interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes, can you tell us briefly what you consulted on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I would say we spoke about the proceedings yesterday, and how they went Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes, what in particular that you can remember about the proceedings yesterday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> We spoke about McCarter going first and it being difficult to go first and what we remembered in broad terms, about the application, what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a>	I don't specifically remember us talking about the interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> There was a specific request made to you yesterday, about the whereabouts of the body, didn't that concern you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> In what regard Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Concern you to such an extent that you consulted extensively on that, trying to relocate the place in the interest of the family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, we most definitely spoke about, amongst ourselves as to the fact that could any of us remember of possibly find where Mr Bhila's body was disposed of and the conclusion of that was, I don't think anyone of us can remember where it was or go to the exact place again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> I take it it was not of primary concern to you?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Well, coming as a request from the family, it was of concern to us and hence we spoke about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes, I used the word primary concern, it was not of primary concern to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, my primary concern is giving the right evidence here and getting through this hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Yes.  By implication, are you telling me that it was of no primary concern to you, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, either it is of concern to me, or it is not of concern to me.  It was of concern, because it was a request from the family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Mr Rosslee, a theory has been advanced to me by the families, that maybe that place where Bhila was killed, was a killing field and you are hiding that place, because you know that more can be unearthed.  What are your comments to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I find that strange Mr Chairman, in that I have only applied, or I have applied for two incidents, of which only one was in Port Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a>	I have been down here, and I have thought about it, I couldn't find that place, I have no further knowledge of if that place was used as a killing field as you say, or for any other reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> The other incident, other than this one, were you also threatened with prosecution in that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> So you only talk about matters where you have been threatened with prosecution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, my application is for two incidents and only two incidents, and on both occasions I was threatened with prosecution, there weren't other incidents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And did you know of any other incidents where other people were involved, where innocent people were killed at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I had no knowledge of the doings of other teams and the specifics with what they were busy with when they were away Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Now, at Vlakplaas,you spent a period of about a year, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And during that period, were you only involved in legitimate operations, legitimate in the sense that you didn't kill innocent people, everything was legal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Bar the incident that we are currently busy with, all the other operations that we, or the times that we went out and worked in the field, were legitimate operations, routine operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> And in spite of your innocence, you carried this throw away guns with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, I did Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Was it the first time that you carried these throw away guns with you, when you had these pistols in your possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No Mr Chairman, they were - I had a bag with equipment in the car, and they would just be with wherever we went.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Had you given anyone other than the gentleman who made the application here, Mr McCarter, did you give anyone other than Mr McCarter any of these throw away weapons at any stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> As I said earlier Mr Chairman, I handed some of those weapons to some of my ex-colleagues at Vlakplaas.  I don't recall specifically who took or who got or if there were any that were left over that went into the armoury, or what the case was with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> You didn't give those throw away guns for a specific purpose of a cover up after these people had killed innocent people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I am sorry, I am not with you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> When you gave the other people the throw away weapons, did you give them these weapons for a specific purpose of covering up after they had killed innocent people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Not specifically.  As I said in my evidence, that was the purpose I used them for, why I had them with me.  I don't know for what purpose the other people carried those weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> But, did you give them as a result of their request or you volunteered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Well, I had them and I asked who wanted.  They were available and whoever wanted, took.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGUBANE:</span> Thank you Mr Chair, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NGUBANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do I understand you correctly to say that you didn't know of the doings of any other teams at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, for instance if I was in a team working in Port Natal, I wouldn't know what the other teams would be busy with on the ground, wherever they were working, be it Eastern Transvaal or the Cape or whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you never discussed it with one another?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I personally, for instance in this matter, to my knowledge, I have never discussed it with anyone else at Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you knew of nobody at Vlakplaas who killed people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I knew of incidents where people had been killed, where terrorists had been shot, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did you discover this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> We have been told, because they were operations that were in the press and prior to that happening, or either they were in the press before the teams came back, or we heard about it from the team.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you decided then that you could distribute these guns as throw away weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, I didn't decide then to do that.  The weapons were available, I had them and I asked if someone wanted them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you obtained them illegally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They should have been destroyed, somebody else was not doing his duty properly, a Lieutenant whose name you said you would try to discover?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Rosslee, what strikes me throughout your testimony here today is the fact that this was your first killing of an unarmed person, and yet you remember very little of the circumstances and I am not talking of the finer detail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a>	When you got the request cum order from Taylor, you set it out in your amnesty application, page 24, that he had told you two of the accused in the Amanzimtoti bomb blast criminal trial had been acquitted, but that they were still continuing their subversive actions and that your task was to arrest them for purposes of elimination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a>	That was your, that was the basis or part of your amnesty application as of December 1996.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you fill this form out, did you make that statement yourself or were you assisted by your legal representative?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My legal counsel was with me when I made that as I recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And obviously you weren't under stress then, you were relaxed, you were possibly in his chambers or in his office.  You never had anyone pressurising you to recall what had occurred all those years ago, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, it isn't.  This application as I recall and I can ask my legal counsel, was done the night before the amnesties closed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes, there was a sense of urgency in that you had to get your application in before the cut off date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> True.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> But apart from feeling pressurised or coerced or under some form of compulsion, there was nothing of that, you were with your own Attorney of your own choice and you were recalling the events as you remembered them, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct, I do, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Would you agree with me then that we can place some reliance then on the accuracy of what you said two years ago, rather than what you say today, because today you don't say much, you basically can't recall much of what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I should imagine yes, we could.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> All right.  On that basis then, we know that Bhila and Nxiweni had been discharged at the end of the State case, and that was roughly on the 18th of February 1987.  That is common cause, I think you will also agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have heard that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And about three days later Bhila was then abducted at Lamontville, near the Kentucky.  As a result of an operation involving your Unit, Ramatala posed as a UDF man or an ANC man and we understand that someone was taken out of prison, Bhila was then lured, he was intercepted and then taken into McCarter's custody, your custody, Bosch, later Wasserman and Taylor and Lembede and possibly Mhieza, held at the pistol club?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Now, you also recall in your amnesty application, when you were in a fairly relaxed mood, that he was interrogated and later on, when you shot him, you said the handcuffs were removed and he was thrown over the cliff, so you remember that he was cuffed.  At the shooting range, I should imagine, he was also cuffed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Under the circumstances, I should imagine, he would have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes, in the same manner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> At the shooting range I cannot recall if he was cuffed in front, hands in front or his legs or whatever, but I should imagine he was restraint.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> My understanding of your evidence, especially Exhibit B your statement to Holmes, read with your amnesty application, that the purpose of taking Bhila to this remote area where the public really wasn't around, is that correct, that wasn't a place frequented by the public?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, it wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was basically to find out where Nxiweni was because your instruction from Taylor was to take the other man out, to take both of them out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot recall, I recall that there was, two people were spoken about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes, and both had to be eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> On the basis that Bhila was one, Nxiweni must have been the other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't recall the name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Okay.  I also want to suggest to you that your interrogation of Bhila would not have been a mild form of questioning, it would have been robust.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I should imagine if the interrogation took place, yes, it would have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> We have heard evidence in other hearings, of the manner in which terrorists were interrogated, brutal sometimes, even savage fashion, ice up the anus and electric shocks, etc, etc.  We have heard evidence like that.  I am not suggesting it happened like that, I am saying it wasn't a courteous question and answer session?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, it wouldn't have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And throughout he would have been restrained, he would have been handcuffed, presumably with his hands behind his back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> As I said, he would have been restrained, I don't know how.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> He would have been so restrained from the early morning or from part of the morning, till almost sunset, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I imagine he was restrained all the time, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And I should imagine too he wasn't shown any courtesy or any favours, he wasn't given anything to drink or to eat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't remember if he was given anything to eat or drink.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Because you were going to execute him later, that was clear, so you wouldn't be showing him any courtesy, would you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> As I said, I don't recall any courtesy being shown to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> It was suggested or put to you by Mr Ngubane on behalf of the family, possibly whether he was naked when he was shot.  You say you have no recollection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have no recollection what he was wearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Wasn't it part of the operation that you would take steps to prevent the body being identified, or identified quickly?  In other words, so that it couldn't be traced back in any way to your Unit or to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> To my way of thinking, where we were was pretty isolated, and sparsely populated, so that wouldn't have happened any way Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> There will be evidence in the other events, for example in the Poshua Ndwandwe matter, when her body was exhumed or the skeletal remains, there was no indication of any clothing, in other words, there was a strong indication that she was naked when she was buried?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, I ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I am just putting it to you at the level, pitching at the level that in order to minimise the risk of the deceased being identified at an early stage, you would have probably stripped the body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Possibly.  I have no recollection of stripping the body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Rosslee, have you discussed the facts of the Bhila killing with Mr Wasserman at any stage up until now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> About, I think it was a week ago, in consultation, we spoke about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Let me ask you this question, did he ask you to assist him in remembering what had happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I think it was more a case of trying to assist me in what happened Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Well, I ask you that because at page 44 of the first bundle, that is the Bhila bundle, and I refer to the extract of Mr Wasserman's amnesty application, under 9(a)(iv) as to the nature and particulars of the elimination of Sipho Stanley Bhila, he said the nature and particulars of this incident are not immediately recalled to mind.  I will do the necessary search etc, and attempt to provide a full and detailed statement which will be provided at a later stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a>	Are you suggesting that he actually assisted you to remember what happened and not the other way around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Between the two of us, we were trying to put the pieces together Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Would your decision to have carried out Taylor's order, have been different if you had been told that Bhila had placed a limpet mine at the Lamontville town offices, had it gone off, causing structural damage but no loss of life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I believe one of the major reasons that I agreed to do this, or indeed carried this act out, was based on what I was told and the potential, what Mr Bhila was potentially going to carry on with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a>	I don't know, it is a difficult question to ask now, in today's climate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> All right.  The fact that he was linked or what the information was, he was linked with the Amanzimtoti bomb on your allegation that Taylor told you that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is the way I understood it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Your version that Taylor told you that.  Did that, the fact that people were killed, white people were killed, shoppers were killed, children, did that have any bearing on your decision to go along and eliminate Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I would say it contributed to it.  That, the information that I received at that point about that, his probable future activities, most definitely had an impact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> This being your first killing of an unarmed person, we heard evidence that you and McCarter worked closely together, you were part of the same Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you speak to McCarter about Taylor's request/order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't recall having discussed it with him.  I don't remember, in all probability between the two of us, we would have discussed the logistics if you like.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I mean it was something that you hadn't done before.  You see, why I am asking you this, I mean Mr Wasserman was available, Taylor's own Unit, why did he have to ask you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I would say number one, he would have needed one of the askaris or at least one of them, to do the approach.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes, no, I am talking about the killing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Once Bhila was in your clutches, it made no difference who did the killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have no idea why Major Taylor asked us to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Why didn't you say, well, get one of your own Unit to do it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> A Sergeant saying that to a Major, number one isn't done, and I respected Major Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> McCarter said yesterday if I recall correctly, he said well, if he had refused, nothing really could have been done about that.  He may have been sidelined.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> And I would agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is it correct that you wanted to kill Bhila out of your own, it didn't take the order, it didn't take, because the way you put it, it was a request.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Out of the blue, (indistinct), would you kill Bhila, take Bhila out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I didn't know about Mr Bhila until this request was put to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> The impression I got was that it was almost like an enquiry, Taylor was telling you about these people that had been acquitted and almost, when you say request, would you mind taking care of these people, it certainly wasn't a definite order in the sense that if you don't carry out the order, you would, there would be disciplinary action taken against you.  It was certainly not pitched at that level?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> To me, a request from Major Taylor and a direct order, would be virtually the same thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just ask on this point again, a question, I have asked it earlier, under cross-examination by Mr Prior now, you again said that you agreed to eliminate him, and now later, you volunteered request.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a>	Why didn't you say then your wish is your command?  You are using language which is not cast in any military terms or any terms of an instruction, an order, something that you had to obey.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, to me as I have said, a request by a senior officer was the same thing as an order.  They asked me to do something, you do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He wasn't asking you to do something, he was asking you whether you would do it.  Otherwise you would not agree, that is really the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a>	Why do you say I agreed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, excuse me, but I think we are getting into semantics here, and I don't get the point of the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You see, if there is a request and you construct the request as an order, you would simply carry on and do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You wouldn't agree or disagree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I agreed to carry out the request.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Is that your understanding if there is an order, you have to agree to carry out the order, or do you just carry out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I most definitely can agree to carry out the order, or not carry it out Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Is that what you are trying to say to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  This "braaivleis" that you recall, it would seem to my mind that certainly you won't simply spend the whole day at a shooting range, without making provision for lunch and there is nothing sinister, I don't know, attached to having a "braaivleis" in the open, whilst you were waiting for further instructions or waiting for dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, as I said, my recollection is that we had a braai there the afternoon, and that was it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And normally with a braai, a few beers are consumed, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Contrary to popular belief, Mr Chairman, I don't believe any alcohol was consumed on that specific day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Normally, generally  when policemen are in the bush, spending some time there and a "braaivleis" is prepared, there is normally beers or alcohol, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I normally drank beer when I am braaiing, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Yes.  Can you think of any reason why Bosch steered well clear of that question?  I put it to him and he said no, his recollection is that someone bought cold drink.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, as I said, I have no idea.  My recollection is that we did braai.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Bosch struck me yesterday as a frightened or nervous person.  Is he generally like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, I haven't seen Mr Bosch for 10 or 11 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> He said he was the official photographer cum video man at Vlakplaas and he didn't know why he was on this operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, I very rarely worked with Mr Bosch, so I don't know what he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> What did he do on your recall, was he just basically sitting around there?  Did he assist you in the interrogation, did he assist in taking Bhila out of the vehicle, what is your recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot remember him vividly doing anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> McCarter also had no recollection of an interrogation, questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> As I said, sitting here today, having heard the evidence, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> All right, tell me these two pistols, these Baby Brownings, or .25 calibre, aren't those the type of weapons you use for almost for killing people, I mean for close up work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I suppose the calibre and the size would lend itself to close up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You wouldn't use your 9 mm to shoot someone in the head from the sort of range that you were from Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I suppose any weapon could have been used at close range.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So why didn't you use your 9 mm, your standard issue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> As I said in my main evidence, it was a throw away, it was a deniable weapon.  If I needed to get rid of it, that is it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> All right, tell me, in your amnesty application, when you made this statement to your legal representative, you were quite clear that you shot Bhila in the head, plus minus seven times?  Let's just take it step by step.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a>	You were clear when you made it, December 1996?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My recollection when I made the statement Mr Chairman, was that at the end of that, the slide was open and the assumption I made was, that yes, the magazine was empty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Surely, you were recounting what you remembered and you remembered when you made the statement in your amnesty application, that you had shot at least seven times, more or less seven times, you had shot into the head of  Bhila, or the person that you were shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a>	You never told your Attorney at that stage, that the gun had jammed and you had cleared the gun or your recollection was that you had cleared the gun, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, it is not correct Mr Chairman.  As I remember, as I said earlier, firing a shot, having the weapon jam, cocking it a number of times, and then the next thing I remember is that the weapon was empty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a>	I don't remember how many shots I fired.  I recall the first shot I fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But that is not what you said in your affidavit that you made to your lawyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I understand that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In your affidavit you said I then shot the suspect plus or minus seven times, in the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I understand that.  What I am saying is it might have been semantics, it might have been anything.  My recollection is firing one shot, cocking the weapon a number of times, and the weapon at the end of the next thing that I can remember, is the weapon being locked back and open.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you told your lawyer that, why didn't he write it down?  Why did you swear to something different?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have no explanation for that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The only explanation I can possibly accept is that you did not tell your lawyer that, because he was writing down an affidavit.  He wouldn't have written down his own version which contradicted what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Very possibly, I just don't see the point of having come here to tell the truth and open up, and lie about something like that of which I am implicated any way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Rosslee, I am not sure whether you heard Mr Prior's question correctly.  He asked whether you had any recollection telling your lawyer, when you made this affidavit, about the pistol jamming?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I don't recall telling him that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> All right, I think that was the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Well, isn't the simple truth that now, in Committee before the public, you have difficulty reconciling what you did with actually shooting Bhila at least seven times, well about seven times in the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a>	It certainly seems more grave than simply on your version, well, at least once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> It goes to your intention, what you wanted to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My intention Mr Chairman, right there was to eliminate Mr Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Well, why did you shoot him in the head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, if we didn't shoot him in the head with a small calibre like that, we probably would have had to shot him more times.  But the point I am trying to make is I recall the jam and purely by clearing the jam, there is no way I could have fired those seven shots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I am going to suggest to you that this jam of the vehicle is a fabrication that you have thought up recently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Jam of the vehicle Mr Prior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Jam of the firearm, did I say vehicle, I apologise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, that will be speculation on your part.  My recollection is firing a shot, having a jam and that is it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Look, you have been taken through this, I don't want to argue and argue, but when you say it is my speculation, it is what you told your Attorney and what you told Captain Holmes, that you shot several shots into Bhila's head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a>	Mr Rosslee, that is taken from your own words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Fair enough Mr Chairman, I don't recall how many shots I fired.  I recall the first one, the jam and the weapon being locked back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I am also going to suggest to you that in fact is the case, that you shot several rounds into his head, the situation couldn't have been that traumatic for you as you have let us believe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Why not Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR ROSSLEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> None thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Mr Rosslee, when Mr Bhila was abducted from his home, he was taken because he was going to be taken out of the country and with a view, I mean the askaris, the story is that the askaris told him that he was going to be taken out of the country for his own safety and for further training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a>	Did he have any clothing with him when he was at the shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't recall if he had any additional clothing with him Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1545"><a name="pos1545"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> So you wouldn't know what happened to whatever parcels he may have had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have no idea Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> The brown bag that was put on his head, when he was taken to the scene of the killing, do you know where it came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I didn't know it was a brown bag.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> The packet or whatever it was that was put on him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have no idea where that bag came from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> You mentioned that you and Mr Wasserman, you discussed this matter and in your own words you said between the two of us we tried to put the pieces together.  The problem I am having with that is, is what you are telling a reconstruction or is it what actually happened and how much really can we put to what you are telling us today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> What I am telling here today is as I recall the events to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> With the assistance of Mr Wasserman and the two of you trying to put the pieces together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I disagree with that Mr Chairman, because I still maintain, we still have differences.  For instance on the flat tyre, I maintain it was on the way back from the scene, other witnesses maintain it was on the way to the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a>	I maintain there was a braai, they maintain there wasn't a braai.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Just on that score, after you had done this, on your way back, did you  discuss this incident with the other members in the motor vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> To my recollection, we didn't speak about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> What were you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I have no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Is it normal for people to commit such an act and not to talk about it afterwards, even when the person that they have killed is no longer there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I wouldn't know what normal is in those circumstances Mr Chairman, but I don't recall if we spoke, and if we did, what we spoke about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> And afterwards, did you perhaps read in the newspapers or hear that somebody had been shot and his body was thrown over a cliff?  Did anything like that concerning this incident, come up in the newspapers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I heard nothing about it until the Attorney General's Investigation Team contacted me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Why did they contact you, how did they link you to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My understanding was that as I said, they had had a statement from Mr Bosch and they traced me, and that was it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Rosslee, can you recall the date that you were called to Captain Taylor, or was he Major Taylor then, to his office when you and McCarter discussed with him, and he told you about the acquittal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, I cannot remember the date Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you remember the date when Bhila was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> From the statements, I recall the date from the statements and consultation, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What date do you have as your date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1572"><a name="pos1572"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Let me just see here.  If I remember correctly it was the 22nd or something, I can't find it here now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1573"><a name="pos1573"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The 22nd of February 1996?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1574"><a name="pos1574"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1575"><a name="pos1575"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, 1986 did I say 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1576"><a name="pos1576"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1577"><a name="pos1577"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> 1987, 1987.  Can you recall anything more that was told you by Taylor when he called you into his office as to why Bhila and the other were acquitted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I can't remember why they were, or if we were told why they were acquitted, the reason why they were acquitted Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He simply said they were acquitted and what did he say more about their activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> My recollection is that they were scared of Mr Bhila and the other person, of carrying on with terrorist activities in the Port Natal area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So they had no evidence that they were already carrying on, they were just fearful of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1582"><a name="pos1582"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot recall if they already had evidence, or if it was - my understanding as I recall now, was that they were going to continue with the activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In other words you understood it at the time that the Court acquitted them incorrectly, and they had to be dealt with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> To stop their future activities, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> For the sake of justice and prevention of whatever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The Court should have found them guilty in other words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I cannot speculate on that, I just know that they were acquitted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Okay.  Now, can you remember the date of that discussion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No.  No Mr chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If I put it to you that the acquittal in terms of the judgement of what is the Judge's name, Thirion, that the acquittal after the closure of the State's case was on the 18th of February, that would have been somewhere during the day, can you remember the time of day that that discussion took place in Taylor's office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No clue Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Something tells me it was somewhere in the morning, by some evidence, would that be possible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> It is possible, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1595"><a name="pos1595"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But it wasn't on the same day, it was probably at least, earlier on the next day, on the 19th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1596"><a name="pos1596"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Or later, but it must have been before the 21?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> In all likelihood, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So what I am looking at is, for some reason Taylor made an immediate decision after the acquittal that he had to be removed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a>	There was no opportunity for Bhila or Nxiweni to prove themselves one way or another?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I should imagine Mr Chairman.  I didn't have a history on Mr Bhila or the other person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you can't recall that he mentioned to you when they were acquitted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> No, off hand I can't remember that at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And according to evidence again, it seems as if they had to be, the address had to be found out, in other words Bhila be located, lured away and taken out, assassinated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1605"><a name="pos1605"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1606"><a name="pos1606"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And all of that from the discussion to the killing of Bhila, took probably from the morning of the 19th, to the 22nd, that is over a period of three to four days, most?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I should imagine so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So that also means that Taylor must have followed, he must have  been there or had someone there who reported to them.  He probably would have had knowledge already because no evidence were led and that was the reason for the acquittal, that they would have been acquitted after the closure of the State's case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I don't know Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1610"><a name="pos1610"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You see, why I am asking this is you went down on the 10th and you returned on the 27th, that is five days after the killing.  You can't remember any discussion about this high profile case at that time, where this Unit had a specific interest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1611"><a name="pos1611"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Are you referring to which case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The Buthelezi and others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> Mr Chairman, I wasn't involved with that.  Not in the investigation, not in the court case.  I don't recall the names even, of the people who were involved in that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1614"><a name="pos1614"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Surely you weren't involved, but I mean to them, to the Unit, for the Unit, that was a priority, it was an important case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> To the local Unit, I imagine it was a very important case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1616"><a name="pos1616"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You can't recall that they ever discussed it during your presence down there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1617"><a name="pos1617"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROSSLEE:</span> I am sure they must have spoken about the case, I just don't recall it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Okay, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1619"><a name="pos1619"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, if this witness may be excused, may I call Mr Wasserman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
