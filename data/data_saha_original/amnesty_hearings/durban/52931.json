I understand that in fact may be being done at the present time and may be taking place early next year but if it is not, I would urge those responsible for investigation to conclude the investigation into the matters which the applicant had asked amnesty for.  In the light of the application do you agree, we grant the applicant leave to withdraw his application.\n\tAnd that I think concludes what is set down for today.
