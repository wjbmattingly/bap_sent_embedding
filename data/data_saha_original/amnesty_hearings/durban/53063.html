<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">XOLANI BRAVEMAN TSOTETSI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Sipho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR SIPHO:</span> Thank you.  Mr Tsotetsi, how old are you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> 28.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> During 1991, where did you live?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> At Nhlalagahle township in Greytown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay, do you know the deceased in this case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes, I know her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> What was her name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Mxquso Victoria Mthembu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay, now you are aware that she was killed on the 28th of September 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes, I am aware.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Did you take part in the killing of the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay, now on that day, were you travelling along in a kombi in the vicinity of the HLH compound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay, at about what time was this on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> About quarter to three in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> What did you see as you drove passed the HLH compound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> As we drove near there, we saw the deceased inside the compound.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Now, you have heard the evidence of the witness who gave evidence before you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Do you agree with the evidence that he gave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> And you would agree then that the HLH compound was inhabited by members of Inkatha Freedom Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes, I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> The members, the people of the township where you lived, were members of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay.  Was it normal for people from the township to go and visit people at the compound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> No, it was not because of the situation in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay, how did you feel about having seen the deceased at the compound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> I did not feel good about it because I knew her to be one of our members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay.  As far as you were concerned, her presence at that compound, what did it mean to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> We were in one organisation.  Her presence being there, did not feel good to me, I wondered what she was doing there, it actually gave me a different picture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay.  Did you then confront the deceased at some later point that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> No, I did not approach her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay, were you in the company of certain other people at the time when the deceased was assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Who were the other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> The people who are here, as well as (indistinct) and Khanyile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> When you refer to people who are here, do you mean all the other applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay.  What did you do to the deceased, if anything at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> I also partook in assaulting her and we then took her to Mr Msolo's home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay.  Is it true that the deceased made a certain confession to you and to the other people that were present there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes, she did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> What was the gist of that confession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> She confessed that she was an informer.  She would actually take whatever we were doing, and report it to the IFP and also was in contact with the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay.  Were you also present at the home of Mr Msolo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes, I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Who is Mr Msolo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> He was the Chairperson of the ANC in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Did you also take part in stabbing the deceased later that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> What exactly did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> I stabbed her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Do you know how many times you stabbed her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay.  Is it true that each and every one of the applicants here, took turns in stabbing her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes, that is the truth, we were all there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay, why was it necessary for everyone to stab her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> We had started this all together, and we had to finish it together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> During that time, well, you have always been a member of the ANC, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay, do you know for how long you had been a member of the ANC at the time of the commission of this offence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> I wouldn't be able to remember quite well, but from the time that I was born and grew up in the township, I have always been an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Now, when you gave your evidence in the trial court, did you readily concede that you were a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Is it true that the Judge found that you were very evasive when it came to giving information about the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> For the record, I refer to page 242 of the judgement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>	Why were you evasive about it, why didn't you simply say that you were a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> At that time, I believed that white people were prejudiced against the ANC.  That is why I did not admit it at court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay, do you know how members of the IFP would have reacted had you made an admission that you in fact killed the deceased, whilst you were a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Okay, in all other respects, do you confirm the evidence that was given by Mr Mhlambo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> Mr Chairman and Committee members, I don't intend to get into repeating everything that was said by the other witnesses, I have just covered certain specific areas.  I intend to leave his evidence at that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SIPHO</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Sipho.  Ms Thabete, do you have any questions to ask the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETE:</span> No Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETE</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Lax?  Sorry, there is no re-examination obviously.  Mr Lax?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR SIPHO</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Chairperson, if you will just give me a moment, maybe Mr Sibanyoni can carry on.  There is one thing I just want to check up with my notes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibanyoni, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, I do not have any questions for this applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Tsotetsi, are you still serving your term of imprisonment or have you been released?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> No, I have been released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that also during August of this year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you have a Self Defence Unit there in that township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> No.  We were just the people responsible for protecting the community, but there was no unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is Mr Msolo still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> No, he is deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Lax?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you Chairperson, you alluded to the one area that was worrying me, I just wanted to check the form.  If you look at page 160, which is the translation of your application form, perhaps to be fair to you, one would also look at page 149, which is the Zulu version of your form, at the answer to paragraph 6(b), you  say that then I was in the Self Defence Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>	You have just told us there was no Self Defence Unit.  Why did you write that in your form, or why did you give that answer in your form?  What did you mean by that answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> I meant that I was a member of the ANC who was acting under the guidelines of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But you know what an SDU is, you have heard of the term before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> I am not very conversant about what they are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Why is it written in your form then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> I thought that as people who were protecting the community, that was part of what the SDU was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see in September 1991, there would have been SDU's in Greytown, in Nhlalagahle and all sorts of places.  The call to form the SDU's happened in the middle of 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>	There would have been an organised SDU in that area, but you don't know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> I would not disagree with that.  I was a member of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What structures were you a member of before the ANC was unbanned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> I was a member of the ANC because in the township, it was an ANC area, but I did not have much knowledge about other organisations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see until February 1990, the ANC did not operate above ground in this country.  There were other structures that were there in place of the ANC.  You don't know what structures those were?  You weren't a member of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> It was the UDF.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, so what structure of the UDF were you part of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> I was a member or follower of the organisation that existed in the township at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, I am asking you what was that structure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> At the time that I acquired political knowledge, it was the ANC that was prominent.  So that is the organisation that I joined.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see there would have been a Nhlalagahle Youth Congress that was formed.  Youth Congresses were formed in the 1980's in all the townships, and I know for a fact that there was one in Nhlalagahle.  You weren't part of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> I will say that I was because whatever happened or took place in the township, I was in line with.  I did not dispute whatever was happening, I always cooperated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you attend meetings, gatherings of the Youth Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see, lots of people will say they were members of this or that structure, but in reality they simply lived in a place where the predominant value was that of UDF or Inkatha or AZAPO or whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>	Because that was the dominant culture, they simply subscribed to that.  They didn't actually joined structures per se, do you understand what I am saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>	As opposed to that, there were people who definitely joined structures, who were part of youth movements, were part of civics, who were part of church organisations, that were all affiliated to the UDF.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>	From your evidence, it is clear to me you weren't part of any one of those structures?  That doesn't mean you didn't support the UDF or the ANC for that matter.  Do you see what I am saying to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now you are here to be frank with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So when we ask you questions about your political affiliation, you must be honest with us.  If you weren't a member of a structure, it is better that you tell us that.  Do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No further questions Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Sipho, any questions arising out of questions put by the panel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER EXAMINATION BY MR SIPHO:</span> Yes, thank you.  Although you may not have been part of any specific structure of the ANC, do you know what the attitude of members of the ANC would have been to members of the Inkatha Freedom Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> What was it, a close friendly relationship or was it a hostile one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> There was no friendship between the two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> And as such, would it have been acceptable for ANC members to be seen in the company of IFP members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> And the deceased in this case, was an ANC member who had been seen in the IFP camp, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> And it is this that motivated the events of that day?  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOTETSI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIPHO:</span> I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SIPHO</p>
