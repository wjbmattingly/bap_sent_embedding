<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOCKHAT:</span> Chairperson, the next applicant is Nicholas Vermeulen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS JOHANNES VERMEULEN:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Cornelius?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR CORNELIUS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>	Mr Vermeulen, you have submitted an amnesty application on the prescribed form, in terms of Section 18 of the law and you have given your full co-operation to the investigating officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> You were an employee of the SAP, as defined in Section 20(2)(a) and 20(2)(f) of Act 34/95.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> You were deployed to Section C1, known as Vlakplaas.  The operations of the unit have been set out in documentation which has already been submitted to this Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And do you concur that Vlakplaas was a covert counter-insurgency unit and was the operational wing of all the Security Branches in the Republic of South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> At the time of these incidents you were involved only in the second incident having taken place on the 12th of June 1988.  At that time you were a Warrant Officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And Col de Kock was your commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> You confirm the content of your amnesty application, the general background, your personal history as well as the general merits thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And you agree that the political objective an action was aimed against the ANC and the communist movements within the Republic, as well as the political insurgency of institutions from abroad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> At all times you carried out the actions or order of Mr de Kock, strictly and you acted on a need-to-know basis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And at all times you acted within the scope of your duties at Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Now with the second incident at Piet Retief, you were also deployed to the ambush?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> What were you armed with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> An R1 gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Very well.  Can you briefly tell us when the vehicle moved in, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> We moved in, the vehicle stopped, the driver climbed out and ran around the front of the vehicle into the bushes on the side of the ambush.  Because he had moved some distance past the pre-established point, Col de Kock gave the order to move ahead.  We left our positions and ran in the direction of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> What happened next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Shots were fired and after Col de Kock had given the order to cease fire, I took up position next to the bus and waited there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Four persons were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, four persons were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Had they been armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, all of them had been armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> You were aware of the practice among the members of C-Section, that they would identify targets and then C1 would be called in to perform the action?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Do you have any reason to doubt the information and orders which were conveyed by de Kock and Pienaar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> You were a foot-soldier, as is the general description?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And these armed MK members, did they present any danger towards the Republic, according to your mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Did you believe that you were acting in the interests of your country at all times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Against the then enemy of the Republic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And that you had to combat the insurgency of terrorists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> With the exception of the salary that you received, in terms of Section 20(3)(f) of the Act of 1995, did you obtain any personal or financial reward for your participation in this action?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Did you harbour any feelings of personal malice or vengeance towards the victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And according to your knowledge, have you made a full disclosure of the relevant facts for the Committee, in terms of Section 20(1)(c) of the relevant Act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> You request thus that you be granted amnesty in terms of Section 20 of the Act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> For four charges of murder emanating from the incident taking place on the 12th of June 1988?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> For your participation in perjury and defeating the ends of justice in the subsequent investigation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And then you are also applying for statutory and common-law delicts or any other delicts of offences which may emanate from your participation in the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR CORNELIUS</p>

<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> No questions, thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR JANSEN</p>

<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR LAMEY</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Moerane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MOERANE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>	Mr Vermeulen, you made two statements relating to this incident.  The first statement being the one that you made in preparation for the inquest which was to be held at Piet Retief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And the second statement being the one that you have made in respect of your amnesty application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Sorry, just say again, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> The second one being the one in respect of which you are testifying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes.  And I assume you are telling this Honourable Committee that the one in bundle 1, page 334 to 335, is the correct one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And all that you had said in the Piet Retief statement, the one in preparation for the inquest was false?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes. Now I just want to take you through your second statement.  You say in the third sentence, that is now with regard to Manzini</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>"He would stop at a certain place with a minibus, climb out and urinate, which would be the signal that the correct people were in the bus."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>That is correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> That is actually what was arranged and what was agreed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Ja, that's what was agreed when I received my orders from Mr de Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> That's right.  And when the rest of you also received instructions from Mr de Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You were all present at the same place and same time, when you were given these instructions and these briefings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Ja, I would say so, but it could be that Mr de Kock gave some order to somebody else at some different time, I'm not sure, I can't say.  But when I received my orders, this was roughly what I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well, certainly the people from C1 would have received the same orders, in other words yourself and Mr Flores certainly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And you further say that bus actually went past the prearranged spot, it didn't stop where it was supposed to stop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And Col de Kock then gave the order that the bus or the kombi should be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And you all got up and ran towards the kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> With the intention of shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Is his evidence also correct, that he ran ahead of you?  In other words, he was in front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And that he was about a metre or two from the left front door of the kombi when he started firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And would I be correct in saying that, as you say in your statement, that you didn't see any shooting from the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> If anybody had fired from the kombi in your direction, you would have seen that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I think so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, because you would have been the target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And it was dark there, you would have seen the flash.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> The flash, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> That's right.  And you didn't see any of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You say, page 335</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>"The weapons which we used here were government weapons which were provided from Freek Pienaar's office."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And you say some uncomplimentary things about the state of that weaponry</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>"I can recall that the weapons were in such a bad condition that I had to oil them first before the operation."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I received an order from Mr de Kock, because he inspected the weapons and they were not in a satisfactory condition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes.  In other words, the weapons that you used on that occasion were not weapons which were issued at Vlakplaas, but they were weapons which were issued in Piet Retief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that for the whole - to all the Vlakplaas members, they received Piet Retief weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Ja, most of the people, I think so, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And would I be correct in saying that there was no proper accounting for the weapons and the ammunition, in the sense of signing for the weapons and the ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I won't say that, I would say in the instance the weapons by number weren't booked out to each individual, but each individual received a weapon plus, I think 20 rounds of ammunition, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Do you remember that?  Is it possible that you might have received more ammunition, like 50 rounds rather than 20 rounds?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> An R1 magazine takes 20 rounds of ammunition and to carry a lot of loose ammunition wouldn't be advisable because it could be lost.  And in an ambush situation I don't think we would have used much more than 20.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> I seem to recall that some of the people who were there might have used more than that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I won't dispute that, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Would I be correct in assuming that you spent a couple of days before the second incident, at a place called Island Rock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And the purpose of that gathering has been said to be one of team-building, "spanbou".</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> What does that involved, what actually happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> "Spanbou" is usually just where the guys come together and they relax.  That was the purpose of that special, that specific "spanbou".</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, but how did you relax, what were you doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> We were playing touch rugby, we were having a couple of beers, fishing, doing just what everybody wanted to do, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And were the any sessions where you'd be addressed by Brig Schoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No, Sir, not that I can remember of, Mr Chair.  We did mix with up casually, but not a specific time or whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Was this a holiday or sorts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> You can put it like that, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And you called team-building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is team-building, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And this went on for four days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well amongst the people who attended that holiday, or were present, were people who had been involved in a shooting incident on the 8th of June.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Was that mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I can't recall that, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well it must have been mentioned, Mr Vermeulen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Mr Chair, as already said, we do work on this must-know basis and if I go on a "spanbou" I don't want to know anything about any other words, except relaxing.  So I don't interfere with anybody else's official work, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> No, no, I'm not suggesting that you might have been interfering, but just as part of "spanbou", one of those or two of those who had been involved telling the others that well, we are doing okay, we have actually killed four of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's could have happened, but it wasn't in my presence at any stage at that "spanbou", Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> In your activities as part of the C1 unit, you must have engaged in a lot of illegal activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Which as we know included murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> It included abduction of people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> It included destruction of property, buildings and motor vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> It involved covering up those activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> By means of lies and other means.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And the murders also involved silencing people so that they couldn't speak.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Were you in any way congratulated for the killings of the 12th of June?  Did anyone say "Well done"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Not that I can think of, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You know that Mr Adriaan Vlok issued a statement after the second incident, wherein he said nine people had been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I just heard about that statement, I didn't read it myself, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Have you received any commendation for the work you did for Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> From?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> From the Commissioner of Police, and then we received various certificates, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> What certificates?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> There was a certificate for recommendation for work that was done satisfactorily, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> I see.  In other words, commendation for work well done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And who is that Commissioner who commended?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I'm not sure, I think it was Commissioner van der Merwe.  I'm not sure about that, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Do you know whether or not at Island Rock, the members of C1 who had taken part in the first incident, were congratulated, commended?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I don't know, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Mr Vermeulen, who told you that you could engage in illegal activities against the ANC in particular?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> All the instances where I was involved, I had the instructions, specific instructions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, yes, but you see this must have started somewhere.  You know that as a policeman you were not obliged to follow illegal instructions, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well who told you that you could, that you could not disobey, if anyone, such instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Our orders that we received from our commanders we just did it properly as was expected from us, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> No-one told you that you could refuse to carry out an illegal, a patently illegal order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> So would it be correct to say that it was the culture at C1, that illegal acts against the ANC were acceptable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, we can put it that way, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Were there any limits placed to the illegality?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I don't know, I think for every action that we would have done or executed, we first had to consult with Mr de Kock and we wouldn't have done anything without his consent, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, but as an individual, did you know of any limits beyond which you couldn't go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I don't know, I was never instructed about any limits, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You know that in a war situation there are certain limits, which have been codified in various protocols, like the Geneva Convention and the various protocols to that?  Treatment of prisoners of war and the rules of engagement in war, you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I know that, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well did you observe any such codes in your conduct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> No, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> No.  In fact you were actually a law unto yourselves so to speak.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> We can put it that way, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> I see.  No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOERANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Moerane.  Ms Lockhat, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOCKHAT:</span> No questions, thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MS LOCKHAT</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Cornelius, do you have any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> I have no re-examination, thank you, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR CORNELIUS</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Adv Gcabashe, have you any questions you'd like to ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Yes, thank you, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>	Mr Vermeulen, the second incident, after the shooting you say you were told to stand by the bus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Yes, you can put it that way, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Did you have anything to do with checking the weapons that the four deceased had on them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I can't remember.  I would have looked at it, but I don't think I handled it at any stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> What I'm interested in is in finding out if any one of them had fired a shot at all, just by checking the magazines to see if they were still fully loaded or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I didn't check the magazines, but I'm quite sure no shots were fired from out the bus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Just on that, Mr Vermeulen, were you regarded as an expert when it got to firearms and weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> I would say so, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because you did say you were the one who was ordered to oil the firearms and get them into a reasonable condition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And in your - yes, thank you.  Sorry, Mr Malan, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, are there any questions arising out of questions put?  Thank you, Mr Vermeulen, that concludes your evidence, you may stand down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERMEULEN:</span> Thank you, Sir.</p>
