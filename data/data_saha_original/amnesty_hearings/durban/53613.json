When we returned to the base in Verulam, we met Larry, Sgt Larry Hattingh as well as Warrant Myeza and Mr Brown.  Mr Brown was a South African Police member, a black member, whose nickname was Mr Brown and he would normally drive us from Pretoria to Durban.  We had a discussion about someone who had survived this explosion who was apparently the brother to the deceased.  It was planned that we were to meet this person.  In fact we first went to the hospital to see this young man and we discovered that he had shrapnel all over his face, his face was swollen and he was seriously injured and Col Taylor asked this young man who had given him the limpet mine and the boy indicated that it had been given to them by Mr Ninela.  From what I could surmise, it appeared that Mr Myeza was not sure of how to get hold of this person and we had to come up with a plan of how to abduct this person and it was at that point planned that we would pretend to be MK cadres because if he was approached by the police, he might divulge everything and that is why we decided that we would go to him, explain to him that we are going to take him out of the country.  The plan was that he was going to be told that he was going to be taken out of the country because of the weapon that he had given to these other boys.\n\tWe then went to his place and it was Myeza who drove the vehicle and I was with Stanley as well.

I returned that grenade to my pocket and we discussed that we should arrange for a later meeting and he should stay put at home, we will return for him.  We then left and reported that we had fulfilled our mission.  We had found the person and he had believed our story that we were MK guerrillas and later on we returned to his house but could not find him, but we found a certain woman and we were not sure whether he had suspected something and became afraid, decided to run away.  We then discussed with Stanley and decided to leave a note telling him to meet us at the Pinetown post office.  Col Taylor's aim was that we should take him out of his home on the very same day, but unfortunately we did not find him, therefore we left that note.  We had left a note telling him of the date of when we would meet.  We then went for that appointment.  We arrived there 13 minutes prior the appointment time and he arrived on the scheduled time and I asked him how safe he was and he said we should not worry about that.  We then thought that maybe he is being escorted by someone or some persons.  We had arranged that we would take him to a pre-arranged spot where he would be arrested.

He was searched and they did not find anything on him.  I do not know whether Myeza had pre-arranged with Col Taylor to meet him somewhere, but we drove to a certain spot where we met Col Taylor.

And I would remind the killers that they did what they wanted to do to their satisfaction and they are still able to do more to satisfy themselves, but after everything has been done, there is a final judgment.  There will be a final judgment which cannot be dodged or forged anyhow, which will be standing in front of each and every person who did it.  It's disappointing to find out that people who are so reliable to the community can act this way, knowing very well what the law is and what steps to take for anybody who has done anything wrong, we are not told by anybody, but still there should be a proof and a lawful proof.  Though I don't know all the details of the law, I have never heard that there is a time when there is somebody told or allowed to kill a person.  There are people who kill people because they have killed anyone, but those people have been caught and sentenced for killing people who have done wrong because anybody, it's not anybody that is allowed to take those actions, except the law.  I wonder why the killers took this decision, while there was a magistrate and a judge who could deal with Blessing lawfully.  On top of that, I wonder why, what has the family done to those killers because it's the first day or time for them to see the family, they don't even know us, but what they did is surprising and hurtful.  I'm sure they wouldn't like it done to them, or to anybody who is related to them, but it was so easy and fine to be done to us.  Why?  Why?  Is there a mother who can clap hands and dance about what these killers did to a son?  If Blessing was their son, would they like what they did to Blessing to be done to their sons?  If any unlawful thing he had done, the law was there to judge him, not to be killed and hidden from the family.  While they tell a statement, they don't tell the truth.  They tell fibs.
