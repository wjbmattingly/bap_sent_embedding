We did not have any firearms on us.\n\tAs we were walking around and we were on top of a hill, we saw two persons and when we looked at them closely, we could not identify them.\n\tI asked them who they were because they were a distance away.  Where we were standing, there was a gumtree forest.  These people did not respond, they started shooting and when they did this, we actually ran and hid behind the trees and they fled.\n\tWe chased after them for a few paces, and we returned because we did not have any firearms on us.  We were just trying to frighten them.\n\tWhen we returned, we were walking along the road, and we met Pat Mbakazi.  He was in a blue or navy Golf and he stopped and he said he was looking for us, because he had heard that we were in that area.\n\tI then told him that we had just been shot at by two persons who had fled, and I pointed the direction in which they fled.  And then he got into the car, and took a road into the left.  We went into the forest.\n\tWe heard the car speeding off and we went back and went home.  When we arrived, we just sat around at home and we did not see them.

Such a person called Dindelwa Poswa was caught and they removed his jacket.  The soldiers were actually not performing their duties.  \n\tThe Ixopo area had been demarcated into two, there was an IFP rank and shops and also ANC rank and shops in the (indistinct) area.  On that day, we were actually walking around.  I wanted to go to my sister's house, it was around two o'clock in the afternoon.\n\tMy sister resided in a shack settlement in Ixopo.  On my way when I was just about to cross the main road outside the Ixopo area, I met two or three girls and they were walking very briskly and I enquired what was going on.\n\tThey said they are not sure what is going on, but somebody must be dead at a certain spot where a van was parked.   On that day I had an AK47, which I had exchanged with that pistol which I had removed from the coloured man.\n\tI had on a long coat and before I approached the spot, I was about 100 meters away from the spot, I removed the AK47 from the safe and put it on the ground and I covered it with a cardboard box.

On that road where I was travelling, I removed the AK and I just put it next to that foot path and I actually covered it with a cardboard box and I continued on my way.\n\tI actually met, when I arrived there, there were four policemen and I asked them what was going on because the van's siren was on.  I thought that maybe one of the ANC members had been injured or killed, and I would have to contact that victim's family to inform them or assist them.\n\tThe policemen said nothing had happened.  I then proceeded to leave.  There was a group of IFP people, there may have been more than 30 and they were calling out at me.  They were actually whistling at me.  I actually told the police that these people were calling me and they said I should actually get into the van and they would actually take me to the ANC rank.\n\tI told them that I was actually going to my sister's house, and they said the were leaving.   I then went on my way.  As I was walking, a distance from about there to the road, I just saw people running after me, a group of people running after me.

I ran very fast and when I actually passed on that spot where I had hidden my AK, I picked it up and they were very close to me.  I then turned and asked them what was going on.  They just stopped.\n\tI asked again what is going on and there was this one person near the foot path, and I asked him again and he was proceeding towards me with an assegai.\n\tI asked for three times, for about three times what was going on and when I asked for the third time, I cocked the AK47 and he proceeded towards me.

Pat doesn't ask the question innocently and the accused, the applicant doesn't interpret the question neutrally.\n\tHe knows exactly what Pat is going to do, so he points those persons out in the full knowledge, or he points that area out in the full knowledge that he knows Pat is going to be involved in the attack.  He then goes further and tries to enlist the support of the other SDU Commander, this Mnini individual, and then Mnini does give him that information.\n\tClearly he knew exactly what was going to happen and then later on, within a relatively short period of time, that exact area is attacked.  He sees Pat's car going in that direction, and he knows that that is the direction which he pointed to Pat and he knew before there was any shooting, that Pat was in fact going to attack, and it transpired that Pat did in fact attack.\n\tI would submit that exactly the same argument ensues.

The difficulty with these things is that if he were charged, there may well be more substantial evidence, where certain people would give evidence, and we might find that there was more to it.\n\tMy submission is that his role does amount to a crime, and it might with the law in relation to common purpose, might in fact even although it will be unlikely, it may well be regarded, he may be regarded as having murdered those people, or charged with murdering those people at the least.\n\tAs regard to the second point that Committee member, Mr Lax, raised about the political motivation, I submit that it is clear from the evidence of the higher profile applicants yesterday, that there was (indistinct) of proper political training, and political education and instruction.\n\tClearly it appeared from what the applicants said yesterday, that one of their purposes was to use an MK person, who was trained properly and correctly, to go into the areas and to perform that role of discipline and political education and political education is obviously up to policy.\n\tTo that extent, that didn't happen here, there was no mention of MK.  He even indicated that MK persons only came into the area after he had left, so there wasn't that direct education which would have enabled him to fully appreciate the policies in the first instance.\n\tHe did however, he was however told by his, the Commander of the other Unit, Mnini that Mnini thought that he didn't want to participate in that attack, but that was clearly Mnini's own position.\n\tBe that as it may, it is not only whether an act is committed in accordance with policy of a particular organisation, that pulls it within the context of a politically motivated act.  There is a whole umbrella of other circumstances, and I submit that in this instance, it falls within the ambit of Section 20(a) and in fact 20(b), and it was, the attacks were directed against political opponents.\n\tOne can go into more detail in that regard, but clearly the pro-active report, and I think with respect, the Committee could possibly take judicial notice of the fact that there was serious violence in these rural areas, particularly in the townships.",

I submit that there is a difference in this instance, in the sense that their authority was more direct, however, the indiscriminate nature and the proportionality of the attacks, is far  - sorry the proportionality in this instance, isn't as extreme as it is in the attacks, those attacks on clearly persons who they don't even know in Newcastle.\n\tAt least in this instance the attack was directed at a known area where political opponents came from.
