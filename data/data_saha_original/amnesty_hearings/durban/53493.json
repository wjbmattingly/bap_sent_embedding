I must say I am a little upset that it doesn't look like this matter again has been properly prepared for presentation.\n\tHave you had a occasion of looking at an application form, that's our application Form 1, as completed by Mr Khumalo, to see whether there was any room made for him with regard to the other acts, and that's the attempted murder, which is a separate offence, and the escape from prison?  \n\tNow what you have to do is, on the basis of what is contained before us, you have to apply, if you think you have any grounds to do so, for an amendment of his application, not the affidavit, because he is here because of what is before us, which is the application that's Form 1.\n\tNow we will adjourn for five minutes to give you an opportunity to go through this application properly and to take proper instructions.  We cannot afford to be adjourning all the time to afford lawyers an opportunity to do what they should have done before we start our proceedings.  It is, I think, eating away our time.  Our time is very precious, this is a very short-lived Committee.  We want to see counsel being properly and fully prepared so that we don't waste time.  \n\tWe'll adjourn so that we can consider the matter properly and see what grounds you can base your application for an amendment of his application on.  Please study the application form carefully.",
