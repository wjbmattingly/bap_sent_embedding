Rather than on that point if my memory serves me well there was once a comment in the Daily Despatch by General Kat Liebenberg to the effect that the South African Defence Force doesn't have the capability to protect each and every individual white as they expected and as it seems to be the demand therefore that on it's own created contradictions in terms of interest for the first time in the history of this country, that the government and it's constituency cannot move in one perfect step in terms of political interest.

On the 5th October in '92 I had a meeting with the caddies, it was myself as Captain, Mr Dorrington as the President of the Club and Mr Max Stimelo who is a prominent black member of the club, where we sat down and discussed the increase and what we'd expect of them and what they want of us and that we did on a three/four times a year basis.",

What we introduced was that once the caddies were graded, they would then be given a shirt with an Aloe on it which is the King William's Town emblem.

            "I was not present on that night as I cannot lead evidence directly but I would like to record some of my thoughts and feelings about this process.\n\tI think that by and large we have heard a lot of the truth from the applicants and their version of the events that happened.  There may be some disputes here and there but I feel that by large they have revealed their experiences.  I think it's clear that their actions were politically motivated whether or not their actions satisfy the proportionality requirement is something I don't feel qualified to judge.  I think that I'm personally too affected to make that judgement but I trust the Commission will make that judgement.  I think that at one level my parents died as a result of a horrible accident that seeking to hit a target of military and political personnel, APLA hit a Christmas party for the Wine Circle.  But at another level, my parents died because they were symbols and I think this is how the applicants see it.  They died, as white people they were symbols of an oppressive system of government and I think that for me, part of my understanding and as part of my healing process, is to see them again not as symbols and not as victims but as people -  see my parents again as mother and father.  My parents had a life which had it's share of losses and pain.  Three months before they died my eldest brother died, took his own life.  It was a tragedy which had hit them extremely hard and I think at the time that they died, they were just beginning - just beginning to grapple with that.  I think people who knew my parents will testify that they were loyal friends, extremely loyal to the people they knew and they were also very close and intimate married couple.  They were a loving husband and wife and a model which I have found inspiring in my own marriage and I think lastly they were extremely caring parents.  Caring to me and my younger sister and my elder brother who died. \n\tSo I think that for me one of the primary objectives of this reconciliation process is for me to see my parents not as the symbols for which they died but as the human beings in the role the played in my life.  \n\tOver the past two days I have heard the anger expressed by the applicants, the anger at what they saw and suffered under the Apartheid System.  Well I hear that anger and I sympathise with it and as far as I possibly can I empathise with it but I would also like them to hear my anger, an anger at my sense of loss of having lost my parents and the loss that my sister and I have had to bear.  Within a week or two of my parents' death my sister developed her first symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis which the doctors confirmed came on as a result of the trauma.  Multiple Sclerosis is a nervous system disorder.  She is now largely confined to a wheel chair and is partially blind.  So part of my anger is about having to have to bear these things - my sister too, having to have to bear these things.  \n\tBut I think that part of my path of reconciliation is having to find a way to lay that anger down, to put it to rest and I would hope too that the applicants would feel that they have the opportunity to lay their anger down too.  Which makes me think about another kind of reconciliation - the kind which I think most people think of when they think of the TRC and that is whether there can be any reconciliation between the perpetrators and people such as myself.  It's difficult for me to think about, having been here for the last few days I'm not even sure the applicants wish that or perhaps this isn't the right occasion.\n\tI'm not even sure under what pre-conditions or under what conditions any kind of reconciliation can occur but I would like to state that I am willing to engage in a process which might lead to that so I would like to say that I am open to that and if people here are willing to engage me in that they can do so through the TRC.  That's all I'd like to say.",

            "Thank you.\n\tFirst of all Mr Chairman, without trying to make a mockery of the proceedings, I find it very ironical that at this hearing, people who murder innocent people in golf clubs and in churches can take an oath before Almighty God.  The very murderers who talk about God and his people in their testimonies, how can we believe them no matter what political motive they imply.\n\t I certainly do not believe that the full truth has been disclosed in these applications.  In terms of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, yes I can relate to the need to find the truth.  I don't believe we have heard all the truth.  But in terms of reconciliation, I must differ with my colleagues.  The only people I can reconcile with are other people that have been effected by these atrocities.  The Hani family, the Biko family and many, many others, black or white - it's not a racial issue.  Victims - but I can not reconcile with murderers.  I can identify with Mrs Hani and I can respect her stance regarding amnesty for Janus Walus and Clive Derby-Lewis.  What they did was a preplanned murder and I believe the same applies in this instance.\n\tI do not aspire to communistic or political ideals of any sort but as individual human beings we all share a tremendous sense of loss of our loved ones.  The process of transition to democracy was irreversible at this point in time when the attacks took place. \n\t  Notwithstanding the purpose that the Truth and Reconciliation has served for some individuals and please, I'm not on a hatred and bitter path, I'm expressing my feelings as I feel them, there should be no reconciliation in my books.  Instead we should be having a War Crimes Tribunal if this is to be classified as an act during a war time.  The civilised world demands this of the Germans who committed atrocities against innocent Jews and so should we if we are to be seen as a civilised society.\n\tThis atrocity shook the world let alone an entire community, black and white.  The eyes of the civilised world must again know what action this so-called democratic land of ours will take against cold blooded murderers who hide behind political motives.\n\tI believe that this Commission will be failing in it's duty if amnesty is granted because they may divulge the truth but they have not reconciled victims with perpetrators but rather victims with victims irrespective of their race or political affiliation.
