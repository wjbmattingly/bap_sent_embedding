A casspir, armoured vehicle was parked across the road on the outside of the gate.  I was told by a then Ciskei Police member, who was armed with an R4 or R5 rifle, that I am not allowed to leave the premises.  I was then informed that I must go back to my offices.  I then turned back and went to the Administration building of the Police College where I saw Colonel Bonguza and Colonel Oosthuizen's vehicle was also parked.  On my arrival there, I went to Colonel Bonguza's office where I found him and Colonel Oosthuizen and another Officer whom I cannot remember, where they also informed me that we were not allowed to leave and that the Police members, the then Ciskei Police members were unsatisfied and were waiting for Commissioner Nqoya, Gen Nqoya, to return, that he had a meeting with them.",

            "RAYMOND PIETER SIMS",
            "At that stage, Mr Chairman, I did not know, they just said they were not satisfied and that they were waiting for Commissioner Nqoya.  I found out later what the reason was.   Mr Chair, while we were still in Colonel Bonguza's office, Inspector Mfene and two or three other members arrived there.  They told us, we weren't requested, they told us that we must accompany them, that we must go to the College hall and that we weren't allowed to stay alone in Colonel Bonguza's office.  We then accompanied him and Colonel Oosthuizen, Bonguza and myself, we stood outside, next to the hall was a tree, we stood under the tree.  The side doors of the hall was open.   Nkwenkwe was sitting, I could see him there and while we were still standing under the tree, Nkwenkwe shouted and said that we must be brought into the hall because we weren't allowed to stand outside and that we were having our own meeting, gathering there.  We were then instructed, I don't know who the member was, that we should go into the hall, we weren't allowed to stand outside.  On our entering the hall, we were told to sit on the stage, there was a table and we were told to sit behind the table.  I sat first from the left, as we came in, Colonel Oosthuizen and then Colonel Bonguza and some other Officers that were there.  On our entering, I saw that there were a lot of people, a lot of members, even the students that were still undergoing training, were there.  They were singing, shouting, it was chaos.  Inspector Mfene, he was sitting at a table, Peteni was at a table and a few other members were there.  At that stage, there was no loudhailer, people were shouting, people were trying to talk from the front.  Eventually at some stage, they saw that there was nobody appointed as a Chairman to address the meeting.  Inspector Mfene was then appointed as Chairman of the meeting.  Throughout the whole evening, he carried on as Chairman of the meeting.  The first, I will say the first part of the meeting, there was a big argument between the members from the floor with Captain Mondo, they were wanting the keys to the armoury at the Bisho Logistics which is just situated next to the Police College.  They wanted the keys to the armoury, some of the Logistics personnel said they did not have the keys, the others said it was with Colonel Vuso.  I think she was then a Constable, female Constable Nhlela, she was also shouting and saying that the keys were with Mondo.  Eventually a group of people from the members were appointed to go to the Police Logistics and the armoury to go and fetch the key, to get the key, to arm themselves.  They got the key, Colonel Vuso was brought to the meeting.  After the members armed themselves, a loudhailer was found because some of the members at the back of the hall couldn't hear what was going on.  Then with the loudhailer, they started talking about pension money that they wanted to be paid out to them, they spoke about funds, some funds of the Ciskei that they wanted to be paid out to them.  That is at that stage that it seemed to me that that is what this meeting was about, it was that they were wanting their pension money, they were wanting other moneys that were paid into clubs.  The matters of promotions were brought in.  While these discussions were taking place, I say discussions, but if I can put it in my own words, it was an absolute circus.  Other officers were brought in.  Captain Makwethu, they were mocked, they were made fools of.  As Captain Makwethu said, they questioned him about money he was alleged to have stolen.  While they were addressed from the Chair, from the table, people were still singing.  They were singing songs \"down with Gqozo\", but as Captain Makwethu said, they changed it to anybody they liked, who was brought in, they changed the name to that.  Later Mr Goosen and two or three other gentlemen, I don't know who they were, they came in.  They told the meeting that then Brigadier Gqozo had resigned.  That is the only part of the meeting that I thought had something to do with politics, when they were told that Brigadier Gqozo had resigned, because at no stage while I was present at that meeting, was anything whatsoever, except the singing, mentioned that the purpose of the meeting was to have Brigadier Gqozo to resign, was to have the Officers to support them.  At no stage was that brought to our attention.  We were, if I say we, myself and Colonel Oosthuizen, at one stage we spoke to he was then Inspector at that stage, Pongola.  We said \"what do we have to do here, we are seconded members, we have got nothing to do with this, can't we be released\".  He spoke to the people at the table, I can't say exactly to whom and he said that he was going to take us out, they can let us go because we've got nothing to do with the Ciskei and the Police there as we were only there to train them and to help them.  Nkwenkwe and  Nhlela again, they are the people that shouted and said \"no\", we are part of the Police, the Ciskei Police, we are working there, we cannot be let go.  Pongola took us up to the door to let us go and then we were turned back there again by other members who were armed with R4's, R5 rifles.  We then stayed at the meeting.  During the course of the meeting, General, the Commissioner, Gen Nqoya, he was brought in, other Officers were brought in.  They were mocked, they were asked about finances.  Commissioner Nqoya was asked about an affair he had with a certain Captain, a woman Captain.  Then later during the evening, they questioned him also about the moneys, about the pensions, why didn't he come back to come and address them from Brigadier Gqozo's office where he said he was going to see him regarding the pension money, about what is going to happen with them and then they asked about the moneys, about the paying out of the moneys.  Then he said he's got, that is now Nqoya, he said that he cannot sign for the money alone, that Brigadier Nkani and Giba also had to sign.  Then members were sent to go and fetch Brigadier Nkani and Brigadier Giba.  They were brought to the meeting.  They were held there until the next morning.  I can just also mention that when Mr Goosen was there, he also requested the members and the Committee at the hall, that the Officers should be released and they, the members and the Committee, did not want to release the Officers.  He told them that Brigadier Gqozo had resigned, there was no need to keep us hostage any more, they refused.    The next morning, Mr Jurgens arrived with one or two other people again.  The questions that were put to them, to Mr Jurgens, had nothing to do with politics.  It revolved around the promotions of members and the alleged fraud cases, the investigation thereof and they wanted him to give a decision right there and then about Nqoya, Makwethu and those people, to be, that they will be prosecuted.  He told them that he couldn't do that, he still had to go and see what was going on, read the cases and in due course, he would give his decision.   He then left.  The two Ciskei Defence Force members, the only two members that I saw from the Defence Force, arrived there that morning as well.  It was only then that I heard that the Committee and the Police members there were informed that the Civil Servants and the Defence Force members were going to the Bisho Independence Stadium where they were going to be addressed by Brigadier Gqozo.  At no other stage, the whole night, was anything mentioned, nothing regarding politics were mentioned.  That was the first time that I heard that Brigadier Gqozo was going to address them.  The whole meeting the whole night, was as I said, about the money, about promotions, the moneys that had to be paid out to them.  It had to be explained to the members at one stage, that the pension cannot be paid out to them, the pension moneys could not be paid out to them the next morning as they wanted it to be done, because those moneys weren't kept at Police Headquarters, those moneys were paid in at certain insurance companies, to get interest and that.  Only then did they understand that.  The rest of the moneys, they wanted.  Gen Nqoya and Brigadier Nkani and Giba, they were taken by some members to the Bisho Police Headquarters, to go and get I don't know if it is cheques or what, but to go and organise and to go and work out what moneys must be drawn for the members to be paid out.  That according to me, was their main cause the whole evening.  The meeting that was, if I can just come back to the 22nd, the morning of the 22nd, the meeting that was to be held at the Bisho Police College hall that morning, the Inspectors, that is why only the Inspectors were summoned to that meeting, the Inspectors were going to be addressed by two Ciskei Police Inspectors who were sent, I think it was to Pretoria, I am not sure, to be informed about procedures that would have to be followed in training members for duties and what is expected of the Police at the forthcoming elections as they had never performed duties in such instances.  That is what the meeting was supposed to be for.",

They were shouting from outside, telling me to open the door.  This went on to such an extent that one of the back windows was broken.  I refused because at that time, my wife and my children were awoken up.  I refused to open and my wife forced me to open.  When I peeped through the window, I saw the Police cars.  My wife ended up opening the door.  When these people came in, this person that I saw was Tondile, I saw the other one, that was Mshimpela.  There was another one who was also coming in, I saw him later, that was Sergeant Vileam.   He is the one who uttered some words asking me the reason why I did not open the door.

            "During the night, we normally lock those gates.  I realised that they did not open the gate, they just jumped the wall.  Vileam was armed with an R4 or R5.  He was having that firearm when I was going to my room, he was with me also.   I dressed up.  I went out, he took me to one of the cars outside.  On our way in Zwelitsha, we met with a car that I identified it as Brigadier Condo's car.  It was also driven by Police.  The Police that were with me in the car, stopped.  They talked to the others and they told them not to continue because I was with them in the car.  I was told to alight from that vehicle, to get to the other one.  The car left and the way that this car, the manner this car was driven, an owner of a car would not do that to his own car.  It was even difficult for them to stop at the robots or traffic lights.  It stopped at Brigadier Suys' place, even there, they went inside but they came back saying that they couldn't find him.  I went to clarify that I couldn't identify these Police, I only knew their faces.  We left there for the College.  Even there, I was pointed with a gun, I was pointed at with a firearm to get inside.  They said here is one of them.  I went up, joining the other Police Officers at the podium.  I am certain that we arrived at the same time with Captain Sawuti because when I was there on the podium, he was here next to me.  I was given a microphone, but after Captain Sawuti refused to talk through the microphone, I was told to identify, to introduce myself or identify myself and tell the people about my rank and where I was based.  I did so.  I sat down after that.  When I looked at the situation, it was such a confusing situation because the other one would raise another subject and the other one would say something else.  What I grasped there in that process is that they were talking about the moneys that were embezzled or (indistinct).  They were talking about pension funds or pension moneys.  The time was about half past three.  I went towards the direction of the toilet on the podium, I sat there.  I went out at about five, that is when I saw Brigadier Nkani and Brigadier Giba being brought inside.  They were not coming in voluntarily.  They were driven with R5's and R1's or something like that.  They were also taken up to the podium, they were given the microphones, they were questioned about the money.  At about seven o'clock in the morning, Jurgens came.  They had told them that they were waiting for Jurgens to decide on those cases.  Jurgens came, he told them that what they were doing was wrong.  He was being forced to take a decision about our cases.  He said though he couldn't take any decision, but myself and Captain Sawuti and Captain Dolweni and Captain Gqibithole, we had to be charged for fraud.  He said that he was doing all that under pressure, and we were supposed to pay for bail and we were not supposed to be arrested or being put behind the bars.  There was excitement in the house, we were driven out, it was myself and Captain Sawuti, we were taken into a van and inside that van Kopel came and he took us out of that van, he took us to some car or vehicle.  We were taken to Bisho Police station.  When we arrived there, we were charged and Gen Nqoya came and Dolweni and Makwethu.   It was realised that there was no court in Zwelitsha, we went to Jurgens to ask him what is it that he was going to do about the situation.  He told us to pay the bail at the Police station and he told us that the bail shouldn't be more than R100-00.  He told us that he couldn't do otherwise, but we should be careful after getting out of that place.   We paid the bail.  I went home.  That is the end.",

Inspector Luwana came to me, he told me that all the Police were at the Police College, so he told me to get inside the car to go there.  Indeed as he said, I got to the car, we drove to the Police College.  When we arrived at the Police College, we found out that they were leaving for the stadium, they were going to the stadium.    He told me not to get out of that car, because we are going to the stadium.  We went to the stadium.  When I arrived at the  gate at the stadium, Inspector Matigani arrived.  He told Inspector Luwana that he (indistinct) arrived at the Police station, Major Kopel told me that Mr Jurgens had decided for us to be charged concerning the money that we were accused of.  They took my finger prints there.  When we finished there, we were taken to the Supreme Court to Mr Jurgens.  We met Mr Jurgens there, he said to us he knew that we were Police.  Because of the pressure that was imposed on him, he was forced to prosecute us even though he did not see the docket yet.  He then told us to pay money, bail money of about R100-00.  We paid that money at Bisho Police station, we were then given a date on Monday, to go to Zwelitsha Court.   That is all, sir.",
