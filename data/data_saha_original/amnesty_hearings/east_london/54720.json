They were caught in the cross-fire.  There was a kombi that was proceeding past the Da Gama factory and I've discussed the matter with both of them and suffice to indicate to the Committee that they are satisfied that they simply, their names be placed on record and that at the appropriate time they be referred to the Reparations Committee as victims.",

They were innocent people driving by in a taxi and they were caught in the cross-fire between the applicants and the security policemen who were shooting across the road.  They did attend the Da Gama hearing two weeks ago and for the reasons that I've now set out they are quite happy that their names simply be placed on record that they were injured in this incident.\n\tThe one is a lady, Mrs Joyce Zoliswa: Z-O-L-I-S-W-A Nonkumbana: N-O-N-K-U-M-B-A-N-A.  She was injured in the leg, she was a passenger in the taxi and one, the driver of the taxi was Mthuthuzeli: M-T-H-U-T-H-U-Z-E-L-I Pellem: P-E-L-L-E-M.

Mr Chairman, I don't know - there was also the other aspect, whether Leklapa Pashlela or Jimmy Jones, their role in the entire matter was raised at the last hearing.\n\tI have no feedback from Mr Mbandazayo whether Mr Leklapa is available to give evidence in this matter or whether Mr Jimmy Jones - I understand Mr Ntonga represents Mr Jimmy Jones and he indicated to me that he had no instructions regarding whether Mr Jimmy Jones would give evidence.\n\tMy view is that the matter I don't think can be concluded properly without - unless of course there is no indication that they are going to or want to give evidence but I don't think the matter can be properly concluded without hearing something from the APLA high command.",
