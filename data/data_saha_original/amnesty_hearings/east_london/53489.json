            "Even though this happened a long time ago but according to what I can remember on that particular day General Nqoya arrived at the office saying that there was a meeting that was supposed to be at the police college.  At this meeting there were the police, I think plus or minus five of them but they were not above five, who were sent to Pretoria to be trained in connection with elections.  So these police were going to go to the college and tell the other police the role that the police were going to take when the elections were going on.\n\tBrigadier Bongusa who was the commander of the police college at the time, he was sent by General Nqoya to call the police in order for the police from Pretoria to give a report back to other police on what role they were going to take in the elections.  General Nqoya said he was going to attend the meeting because he wanted to hear what role were the police going to take at the elections.  I think at about 9 or before 9 he received a message that he was being needed at a meeting with Brigadier Gqozo at his office.  He postponed the college meeting.  He went to attend the meeting with Brigadier Gqozo at his office.\n\tWhen he arrived there at Brigadier Gqozo's office he was told that that meeting was being postponed for another day that was not set yet.  Then General Nqoya, because when he looked at the time he could see that it was still early so the meeting at the college was not over at the time.  Because he was interested to know what role the police were going to take at the elections, he said that we must go to the college.\n\tWhen we arrived at the college inside the hall there was nobody.  The police were there, they were outside the hall, they were not inside.  He then said he wondered why these police were outside because the meeting was supposed to be on inside but he just said that and then he went inside.  When the police saw him they said \"here is Nqoya\" the police that were outside.  They then called the other police, they went inside the hall and General Nqoya went in and he went to the stage.  All the police went in and they were inside the hall saying \"down with Nqoya, down with Nqoya\" when they were coming in.  \n\tWhen General Nqoya was in there, Inspector Mfene took the microphone, he told the police to keep quiet because there was noise there.  He said \"down with Nqoya\", he told the police to keep quiet and indeed they did so.  He was addressing the police and he said that \"here is General Nqoya, the one we are waiting for, he is here.\"  He had arrived and we wanted him to tell us about our pension funds because according to our information all the TBVC States had been given their pensions and if we would go to the new South Africa without getting our pension money, we won't be able to get it and the issuing of promotions, we wanted him to tell us about the pensions.\n\tAfter that he took the microphone and gave it to General Nqoya to address the police.  After he had given the microphone to General Nqoya I went out at the time so I couldn't hear what General Nqoya said because I went outside.  I went to Brigadier Bongusa's office.  When I arrived there I asked whether the Brigadier was away of the meeting that was going on at the hall.  Brigadier Bongusa then said, he asked me whether I was with General Nqoya.  I said yes I was with him.  He asked where he was.  I told him that he was inside the hall.  General Bongusa said \"General Nqoya was not supposed to go there he was supposed to call me before going to that meeting.\"  He then said that he was not going to attend that meeting at the hall.  That was Brigadier Bongusa saying that.\n\tI asked him what was going to happen now because Brigadier Nqoya was inside the hall.  Brigadier Bongusa said he doesn't know what was going to happen.  But because I knew that General Nqoya was not away, of what was happening there, because he only knew that he was going to attend a meeting in connection with elections.  When I arrived at the college I went to the meeting again, I went straight to General Nqoya when he had this microphone with him.  I said \"General, Brigadier Gqozo wanted to see you in his office.\"  After saying that General Nqoya said to these police \" I received a message just now saying that Brigadier Gqozo wanted to see me in his office.\"  \n\tAfter he said that, Inspector Mfene took a microphone again asking the police whether they should release him or not.  Others said yes, others said no, so they didn't agree with each other.  General Nqoya then said that they must write down their complaints or demands so that he can take that list to Brigadier Gqozo and discuss those with him because he didn't know anything about the pension issues, he also wanted his pension money.  So he said that he must write down these issues and then he would go and discuss them with Brigadier Gqozo.  The police then agreed with each other saying that they must release him.  They then wrote down those issues, I think they wrote them in General Nqoya's diary.\n\tGeneral Nqoya then left and he went to Brigadier Gqozo.   When he arrived at Brigadier Gqozo's he said that \"Brigadier, the police that are at the police college, they want their pension money, they are concerned about promotions and I was not clear about the pension monies of the police, I just heard about that issue that the civil servants pensions were at Sanlam but I can't explain to them, I can't satisfy them with my explanation of how to go to Sanlam.\"\n\tBrigadier Gqozo then said \"What are you saying then?\"\n\tGeneral Nqoya then said that he prefers that somebody who was aware of where the pensions were must go and address those police because they had to be addressed, they cannot be left like that.\n\tBrigadier Gqozo then said \"Okay, I will call the Minister of Finance to go and address those police\" because he was the person who knew where the pensions were.  Brigadier Gqozo then phoned.  At the time at the office it was Brigadier Gqozo, General Nqoya and the Minister of Police, Brunet, at that office together with other people that I didn't know but I knew those three.  Brigadier Gqozo then phoned the Minister of Finance saying that he is asking the Minister to go to the police to address the police concerning the pension issues.  As this was a complaint to the police it was all the people from Ciskei at the time were complaining about this because everybody wanted their pensions because there was a rumour that if they were going to be incorporated in the new South Africa they won't get all that money.  \n\tWhen the Minister of Finance answered he said that yes, he can be able to address the police but he cannot go there while those police were armed, he cannot go there and address them concerning the pension issue whilst they were armed.  He said that he would ask for a armoured vehicle from the soldiers and he would ask the soldiers to escort him so that he can address the police because the police had to be addressed.  The minister, he said that on the phone, it seemed as if they were agreeing with each other when Brigadier Gqozo said that he would be escorted by the soldiers.  He then dropped the phone, Brigadier Gqozo then phoned these soldiers.  At the time it was past 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon.  Brigadier Gqozo then called the soldiers.  He said that he was asking for back up from the soldiers because he doesn't know what the police were doing, they were asking for his pension so he wanted to send the Minister of Finance to address the police so he - I don't know whether he referred to it as a platoon or what but he said that he wanted them to have an armoured vehicle to accompany or to escort the Minister of Finance so that nothing can happen to him at the college.  I think that the soldiers said that they could not go with him because they also wanted their pension money. \n\tThen Brigadier Gqozo said that even these soldiers, they want their pension money, all the Ciskeian people want their pension money.  I then thought that maybe the soldiers refused to escort the minister, they also wanted their pension money.\n\tWhen Brigadier Gqozo realised that these soldiers didn't want to escort him, he spoke to the Minister of Police, Mr Brunet, saying that he must phone the stability unit, I don't know whether in East London or where, so that the stability unit can come with an armoured vehicle, take the minister and escort the minister to these police so that he can address the pension issues to the police.\n\tIt was towards 6 o'clock at the time.  Then Brigadier Gqozo said that he was leaving.  He said \"General, I spoke with Minister Brunet, he going to sort this all out\".  He said that he was leaving and then indeed he left.  We were at his office at the time.  Brigadier Gqozo then left with his bodyguards.  We realised that the people who were leaving at the parliament, the people who were left behind were myself, General Nqoya, Brigadier Adoni and Minister Brunet and Sergeant Getsi and Sergeant Nqoya the son of General Nqoya.  He said that we must go to the ministerial complex where Brunet was staying.  He said that we must go there and wait for the stability unit so that they can escort the minister to the police college.  We indeed went to the ministerial complex.\n\tIt was after 6 towards 7 at the time.  We waited there for the stability unit.  Whilst we were still waiting there we heard the 8 o'clock news that Brigadier Gqozo had resigned.  We heard that from the television news but we didn't believe that because the last time we saw Gqozo he spoke with Brunet so that he can arrange for the stability unit to escort the minister to go and address these police.\n\tAt about 10, 10 o'clock news, Inspector Luwana who is a Captain now from the former Ciskei, I think he was at the college at the time, he appeared on T.V., he was being interviewed, asked how they felt that Brigadier Gqozo had resigned from his position.  He said that they were happy and they had forced him to resign.  He was interviewed at the 10 o'clock news whilst we were still at the ministerial complex.\n\tAfter that General Nqoya phoned Minister Brunet asking him whether he had heard what was said on the T.V. news saying that Brigadier Gqozo had resigned.  He then said yes, he heard that.  General Nqoya asked why we were still waiting there, he asked whether the stability unit was still on the way.    He said yes, they were still coming.\n\tAfter 30 minutes, General Nqoya said that he can't wait any more because the stability unit was not coming and the police had to be addressed.  He said to me we must go to the college.  Brunet then said that if General Nqoya was going back to the meeting without any answers for the police he said that the police would shoot him.  He said \"It's better for me to be shot by the police instead of sitting here not knowing what I'm waiting for\".  He then said we must go to the college.  When we were on our way to the college getting out of the ministerial complex, at the gate there were soldiers that were guarding the ministers.  When we arrived there these soldiers saw us and they didn't open the gates when they saw us.  They closed the gates and they called the college saying that \"here is General Nqoya here, we found him.\"  When they said that, two police arrived, Majela and Balus.  They guarded us with other soldiers so that we cannot get out of the car, we cannot move from that area.  We were driving two cars at the time, we were told to sit in those cars.  We then waited there, we were told to wait for the police to come and fetch us.  A kombi came with police and this kombi, Mjikalezi was there, Inspector Loni, Moleshe and one young man but I don't know who it was.  Other people, I can't remember who they were, but I can remember those that I mentioned.  They stopped the kombi, they told us to get out of the car, they pointed us with rifles at the time.  We got out of the car, it was said that our firearms should be taken from us.  Moleshe took our firearms, were taken out of those cars, those two cars.  They took us to the kombi, we then went to the college.\n\tWhen we arrived there at the college there were a lot of police, there were more than the number that was there before when we were there.  When we arrived there with that kombi, the kombi stopped next to the door of the hall.  The police were told to step back and then police, about 8 or 10, came with rifles.  They were pointing at us with those rifles and as we were getting out of the car it was Brigadier Adoni who was going to get out of the car first.  I thought that we were going to be shot at that time because everybody went back and then we were faced with the people who pointed us with these guns.  He went back to the car, this brigadier, I then was the first one who got out of the car and then General Nqoya was the last one. \n\tI went inside the hall.  When I went in the hall, as General Nqoya was getting in, I was the first one to go in and I was also a non-commissioned officer, so I thought maybe this was not effecting me, maybe they wanted General Nqoya.  When I arrived there I didn't go to the stage where the officers were sitting, I went to the non-commissioned officers.  As I was a non-commissioned officer Nkwenkwe called my name telling me that I must go up the stage.  When I was going up the stage General Nqoya was pointed with a gun, was kicked and he was pushed.  He went to the stage, he sat amongst other officers on the stage.  \n\tNkwenkwe said to Captain Makhubalo, \"Go and sit next to him because you are together.\"  Then Captain Makhubalo sat next to General Nqoya.  We all went in and sat down there.  A lot happened whilst we were sitting there.  I cannot remember everything that happened but it was what had already been said here, the CV's of the police were asked and there was a certain inspector that I can't remember his surname but he was working at the security, bugging the telephones.  He would be given a microphone and he would be asked whose phones were being bugged and why they were being bugged and how much money is there for the informers money, such things were being asked because in each and every government there is an intelligence man and they were asked to tell everything that was happening in those offices.  There were a lot of things that were happening there. \n\tThey were also asked about the misappropriation of money that we ended up staying there until the next morning.  When we left there the following morning they didn't focus on me at the time when I was leaving there.  As we were going out I went and joined the non-commissioned officers who went to the college but I was not under pressure at that time, I was able to go home if I wanted to go home.  It was about 8 or 9.  I went to the stadium.  There at the stadium there were civil servants from different departments of Ciskei.  The hall was full and it was said that Gqozo had resigned and he was going to come and address the people concerning certain issues.  I just heard that as I was on my way there.\n\tWhen we arrived at the stadium, I can't remember what was being said but a lot of things were discussed but what I noticed there, the civil servants that were not police, they wanted to take part in what was done by the police.  It seemed as if they were happy that Gqozo was going to come and address the civil servants at large, not only the police about the pension funds.  Nkwenkwe then said that there's nothing between us, we as the police and the civil servants because General Nqoya and Captain Makwethu went to draw money, sports funds money and the widows' fund.  Then Nkwenkwe as the person who had the microphone was told that the money was there so the police had to go and get that money. \n\tThen Nkwenkwe, when he was addressing these people, he said there was nothing that was in between us, the police have to go to the college, their money was there.  So the civil servants were surprised when they heard that the police's money was there and the civil servants had shouted, were shouting saying that the police were only preparing for themselves, they thought that this was done for everybody, so the police were now going to get their money.  They were shouting and insulting the police, all those people that were there.  They said that the police did not know politics so that was what was expected from them, so that ended there and then I left.  That is all I can remember up to now.",

Brigadier Gqozo during the discussions in that panel he mentioned that the march should only go within the boundaries of Ciskei of South Africa and they even went up as far as the stadium, conducted by the police, it was addressed at the stadium.

He said the people got inside there and they were saying that they had won the victory because they managed to go beyond the crossing line.\n\tIn the second march he used the soldiers, the police were not used.  The police were told to stand inside the building, the government buildings and the soldiers were in charge there to prove that he trusted them and the police - that proves that the police were not the people who would lead him to resign that is why I am saying the reason for Gqozo to resign, it was through lack of co-operation between him and the soldiers.",

            "Thank you Mr Chairman.\n\tMr Chairman, the Committee considers this application, my applicants will submit that it will be pertinent to consider the political climate in Ciskei at the time.  There had been a lot of political activity against Gqozo, Biso Mashake, his testimony to this, the ongoing fights between the party that he created, the ADM and other movements on the ground.\t\n\tYour worship, the applicants have stated that the police lived as they still do in these communities.  Their houses were being burnt down, they were ostracised by the community and also what complicated things for them was that Gqozo as Mr Luwana has so eloquently testified, Gqozo was against the police.  He ignored them so the police found themselves in this no win situation, the community doesn't like them and Gqozo doesn't like them either.\n\tMr Chairman, the meeting, a lot has been made in cross-examination about whether the meeting was organised, whether there was any agenda, there was any action planned.  Mr Chairman, with respect, this is an oversimplification of the state in which the police found themselves.  Firstly Mr Chairman, we're dealing with policemen here, we're not dealing about members of a liberation movement who would have formed cells to discuss issues and form out plans of action.  That's one aspect.\n\tSecondly Mr Chairman, it would be unrealistic to suppose that it would have been easy for policemen to meet in those numbers on any other given day.  Police, Mr Chairman, are subject to the orders of their immediate officers etc., they cannot just attend meetings unless instructed to do so.  So accordingly that particular meeting presented an opportunity for those who had an agenda.  Mr Chairman, it is clear and needs no repeating that the meeting was accordingly hijacked by people with a political motive.  It may very well be so, Mr Chairman, that not all the applicants knew, in fact they told the Committee that the meeting would take a certain turn but once it had taken such a turn they identified with the proceedings and took part in the manner and form which they testified to.\n\tMr Chairman, the meeting was essentially political.  Chanting slogans \"down a head of state\" is by it's very nature political.  I needs no further explanation.  Police armed themselves, battle plans were put in place, guarding the perimeters of the Bisho Police College, Police armed themselves with automatic firearms, officers were rounded up, Commissioner Nqoya himself was sought, Gqozo was sought as well, the soldiers joined in the meeting and one of them, we heard the evidence, took the microphone and addressed the gathering to the effect that they were supportive of what was going on and indeed Mr Chairman that was correct because even Gqozo himself was told likewise by the soldiers.  \n\tNow Mr Chairman, an attempt is being made to split the events of the meeting into piecemeal kind of fashion, that is an attempt is being made to separate the questioning of the officers from the meeting itself.  Now I'm not too sure Mr Chairman how this is possible.  The officers, Mr Chairman, were close to Gqozo, Mr Luwana has so testified or the police were being perceived and Mr Chairman I'll submit that that is sufficient.  Now they were disarmed.  Now the people in the know which was Mfene and Nkwenkwe say the idea was to have them all here so that Gqozo could see.  Now it is important also Mr Chairman that the police once gathered there got to understand that the soldiers had also gathered at the Bisho Military Base which would then explain why they refused to carry out Gqozo's order to go and disrupt the meeting.\n\tSo Mr Chairman, the evidence by Mr Luwana which seeks possibly to have us conclude that we must accept that the refusal by the army to carry out the instruction by Gqozo was political in the sense that it led to him stepping down but we must not say that the conduct of the police was political.  Now your Worship this would ...(indistinct), honestly.\n\tWhat is clear, Mr Chairman, from the evidence is that the army people joined or at least associated themselves with what the police had started.  Mr Luwana has told us, Mr Chairman, that there were chants to the effect that down with Commissioner Ngoya in his presence by junior officers.  Now that on it's own Mr Chairman speaks volumes about the general mood of the meeting and the underlying intention which was to manifest itself as the day progressed.  Mr Chairman, Gqozo it is common cause resigned that particular evening.  Now Mr Chairman, the opponents of this application have not even touched that aspect as to whether the Commission should regard this as a coincidence.  Pure simple coincidence.  Well surely, Mr Chairman, they couldn't do so because there is no such coincidence.\n\tYour Worship, the question of the questioning of the officers Mr Chairman, we're dealing here with human beings like myself and Mr Mapoma next to me.  We are seated in a meeting, people are being brought in, what would have been expected would happen that people in the meeting would keep quiet and do nothing for the rest of that night?  Surely not?\nNow  the question is maybe after the hearing that Gqozo had stepped down, nothing further should have been done but Mr Chairman that is to oversimplify the issue of - your Worship we know that the events that occurred in Boputhatswana where the soldiers believed that they had overthrow Mangope only for certain other soldiers to regroup and round up the mutineers and that could not succeed.  So Mr Chairman, what I'm saying here is that one who has got to understand that we are dealing in this matter with people who are essentially part of the armed forces of a country so they know how the armed forces functioned.  You may believe this and in fact the opposite would happen so in any event, Mr Chairman, no letter was presented to this meeting under the hand of Brigadier Gqozo to the effect that he had resigned, that's one issue.  No radio announcement by Brigadier Gqozo in person to the effect that \"I'm resigning\" or \"I have resigned\" was published at all.  He never appeared on T.V. to say \"I've resigned\" so that the people of Ciskei could confirm this for themselves.  At most there was an allegation to the effect that he had phoned Pik Botha to advise him of his intention to resign.  So Mr Chairman, it would be expected too much to suppose that the police should have dispersed at about 7 in the afternoon or in the evening.",

            "Yes thank you Mr Chairman.\n\tMr Chairman, I'll start with the question of disclosure and non-disclosure.  I submit Mr Chairman with respect, out of all the applicants there are two applicants who disclosed what they did and what happened.  It is Mr Toto and Sibuqashe.  Now if one looks at their evidence, Mr Chairman, they disclosed everything as they saw it happening and on their own evidence Mr Chairman, nothing suggested that there was something political.  All I say is that slogans were chanted and also freedom songs were sung but there was at no stage where it was said that look, our aim is to overthrow Brigadier Gqozo.  They are saying it was said that the people were interested in the their pensions, the people were interested in the question of the monies which have been misappropriated by their officers.  Now it becomes very clear that even if ...(indistinct) this notion of Brigadier Gqozo resigning, from the evidence as a whole, that was never communicated to Brigadier Gqozo.  Now how on earth can it be said that A wants B to do this but yet B is not told?  Therefore on the question of this being a political, this having a political motive, I submit Mr Chairman with respect, it does not meet any of the means test in the sense that chanting of slogans and singing of freedom songs, it's a daily thing, which happens every day.  At times it does not have any meaning.  The policemen, Mr Chairman, never addressed a question of Brigadier Gqozo resigning.  All they addressed were their pensions.  All they addressed was their future and it cannot be said that they were having a political motive.  Coming to the question of the resignation of Brigadier Gqozo.  Brigadier Gqozo, Mr Chairman, did not resign because the police wanted him to resign.  I am saying that Mr Chairman because firstly that was never communicated to him.\n\tSecondly, he resigned after he has communicated with the army but is it that he was communicating with the army?  He was saying \"army, go and assist so and so.\"  Now the army said no, the concerns the police are having are the same concerns we are having.  We want to know about our pension.\n\tNow Mr Chairman, the police had sent somebody to discuss the pension with Brigadier Gqozo, Mr Nokala.  The army has not sent anyone.  All Brigadier Gqozo is doing is saying the concerns of the police must be addressed.  He doesn't know that the police don't want him, that was never communicated to him and amongst the policemen who were in the hall, Mr Chairman, there is not a single policeman who says we won't leave this hall unless Brigadier Gqozo has resigned.  None.  There is no evidence to that effect.  All that was there was \"down with Brigadier Gqozo.\"  Understandably so because they believed that their pensions, they can get them from Brigadier Gqozo, which was not the case and the fact that, Mr Chairman, they demand from the Commissioner of Police to disclose their pensions.  It shows how short sighted they were, to think that the commissioner is the one who is handling the funds whereas in truth and reality it was the Minister of Finance.  \n\tNow arrangements were made, Mr Chairman, for them to see the Minister of Finance although it has not materialised.  Now it is very clear Mr Chairman from the evidence led that there was nothing like a coup planned by the police and also there was nothing that was agreed to, that it's going to be a programme of action for the day.  \n\tNow the other issue Mr Chairman is the issue of whether there was a violation of the rights of the victims.  It is clear Mr Chairman from the evidence of Toto and Sibuqashe and other witnesses that the officers were taken against their will.  The officers in the hall were detained against their will and Mr Chairman it would be a great mistake to think that people, with respect, are in the hall and yet what is happening in the hall is not communicated to them like that, look we can only release you guys after Brigadier Gqozo has resigned.

That was after Nkwenkwe had gone back and told them that Brigadier Gqozo had said he'd stepped down.  But it went further than that because one of the people from amongst those police was actually interviewed on the television that evening and by implication and by logical deduction, they must have known that Gqozo had stood down and they must have had a belief in that because it was confirmed on the TV that they were happy, they were happy with the fact that they had stood down.\n\tHere's the question that needs to be answered.  Let's assume that they did have all the political motives in the world that they wanted Gqozo to stand down and it was a show of force that they were displaying at the college.  The question is and let's assume that they wanted to go to the meeting the next morning to hear what Gqozo had to say, the question is why did they then do what they did.  Why did they kidnap people, violate the liberty of people, violate the dignity of people, hold them against their will at the police college until the early hours of the morning.  There cannot be any political motivation for that at all.  \n\tEven if this Committee should find and I submit that there is very little evidence to support it, but even if this Committee should find that they had a political objective, that political objective must have ended when they had received confirmation.",

Yes, maybe the fact that he'd lost the support of the military and maybe the fact that the police looked like they were rowdy and staging an unsavoury gathering added to it, but it certainly didn't cause it.  There were negotiations afoot all the time between Brigadier Gqozo and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the then Pik Botha, regarding his standing down, his handing over the reins to the interim Committee.

            "Yes Chairperson, thanks.  Chairperson, it is almost common cause at this stage of the hearings that there are people who were held hostage after they were kidnapped from their places of stay by a group of police officials who were on rampage if I can put it that way on that day and in a way it is common cause, Chairperson, that these acts were committed in violation of human rights of those who fell victim of those actions and I want to express my sympathy to those who fell victim of that situation and would like to remind Chairperson that these are some of the manifestations of how ugly our past has been in South Africa.  Some people died.  We find situations where amnesty gets granted to people who killed others, people who committed gruesome acts against others, hence the amnesty proceedings, hence the amnesty laws.\n\tNow to come to the issues, Chairperson, I would ask this Committee to be reminded when looking into this particular matter of the history of our country in particular the Ciskei part of South Africa during 1994 prior to the election of the democratic government and in particular during those days when this matter was dealt with.  It is common cause, Chairperson, that during those times there was no free political activities going on in the Ciskei under the rule of Brigadier Gqozo then and Chairperson, we're dealing here with the applicants, the leaders of whom have shown this Committee that at that time they were members of the police and civil rights union which is abbreviated as Popcru.  It is common cause, Chairperson, that Popcru was a union which united police and prison warders and that union was an affiliate of the Congress of South African Trade Unions which Congress of South African Trade Unions was ally of the African National Congress hence the so called tripartite alliance and there was fierce struggle in the Ciskei between the alliance and Brigadier Gqozo then.  \n\tChairperson, it must be remembered they have said, the applicants, that under those circumstances, as Popcru members, they were operating underground during that period.  That in itself, Chairperson, shows the lack of political activity going on in this region then.  It must be known Chairperson, at that period the whole country had free political activities, Popcru was operating overboard anywhere in the country except for Ciskei, hence during then, these members of Popcru it looks clandestinely hijacked a meeting of police officials.  It is understandable Chairperson, I'll submit, that those times it would not be possible for them to just declare loudly that they want Gqozo resign.  The circumstances as they were then did compel that meetings of this nature be hijacked for this purpose.  \n\tNow I would like us, Chairperson, it has been said by applicants that their political objective was to topple or to cause Brigadier Gqozo to step down hence what they did.  I would ask the Committee to consider, Chairperson, the provisions of Section 20, sub-section 3 of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act and consider in particular, Chairperson, the criteria that I've set out there in determining as to whether an act is an act associated with a political objective as mentioned in that act.  Amongst the criteria to be considered there, Chairperson, is the proportionality of what was being done there and the motive.\n\tI submit Chairperson, that the kidnapping of senior police officials and holding them hostage is proportional to the intended objective which is said to have been the head of State then.  It is my submission, Sir, because those were the senior officers who were perceived by the applicants to be going hand in hand with the head of State.  We're dealing with perceptions, it must be noted, Chairperson, perceptions not necessarily facts.  It may well be notable fact that these senior police officers were going hand in hand with Brigadier Gqozo but perceptions were there and I submit those perceptions are reasonable in the circumstances and that being the case Chairperson, it is my considered submission and view, Sir, that the applicants have satisfied the requirements of Section 20, sub-section - I'm mean of Section 20 of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act and I would recommend, Chairperson, that the Committee consider granting the applicants amnesty.  I would recommend further, Chairperson, that the Committee consider referring the victims of this particular act to the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee as victims.  Thank you Chairperson.\nNO FURTHER ARGUMENT BY MR MAPOMA",

Under those\ncircumstances we are going to adjourn the proceedings, but before I do so, can I express our thanks to all those people who have made it possible for us to have this hearing over the last few days in this venue.  It normally takes the efforts of quite a number of people to be able to have a hearing of this nature and we are always grateful for the assistance that is forthcoming.  To assist us in doing that, we have a large contingent of staff that normally assist us in doing so and we express our thanks to them as well as to the proprietors of this venue for making it possible for us to have our hearing here, for the security, the police, those members of the public who have come to listen to the proceedings, it is still an important aspect of our work that it should be held in public so that the public can share in what is forthcoming from these proceedings.  Our interpreters for their assistance, the caterers and to the legal representatives, Mr Nompozolo in his absence, we've already expressed our thanks to him.  Ms Collett and Mr Obose as well as Mr Mapoma.  We appreciate your assistance and we thank you for that and then finally to my colleagues on the panel with me, a word of thanks for your assistance.  We will now adjourn the proceedings.\nHEARING ADJOURNS",
