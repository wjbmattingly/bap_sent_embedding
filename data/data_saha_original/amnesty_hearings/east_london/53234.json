            "... matter on the role is the amnesty application of Zukile Mbambo and Dumisane Ncamazana.  The Committee is as previously constituted.  The legal representatives are the same as before.\n\tMr Chairman, the reason for reconvening was to lead the further evidence in this matter of Mr Jimmy Jones.  He is represented by Mr B B Ntonga, who is present. \n\tMr Chairman before that is done, may I bring the following matters to your attention.  Mr Chairman, you and your Committee will no doubt be aware of the ongoing communication and discussion regarding the availability of Mr Happy Mpahlele to give evidence in this matter, that although placed under notice to be he refused to accept the notice and there were also certain indications by his attorney, Mr Mbandazayo, in an attempt to try and secure his attendance, culminating in a meeting with this or with certain Committee Members in, I think was it Pinetown?  Mr Mpahlele has not made himself available and I understand is not prepared to give evidence.  He indicated that there were certain preconditions that would have to be met before he gave his evidence, and those preconditions have not been met.  They relate to certain lists of APLA cadres in the possession of the police and the police aren't willing to release those.  So by and all it's a situation where Mr Mpahlele is not making himself available.\n\tNow on the 1st of June - and as a result of an approach made to the PAC by the Commission, I think it was Doctor Alex Boraine that had spoken to Mr Mondane and the President of the PAC, the PAC submitted to the TRC certain submissions which is dated the 27th of May. Those were circulated to all interested parties by letter, or by fax letter on the 1st of June 1998, in particular the applicants' counsel was faxed a copy of those submissions on the 1st of June 1998.  May I enquire whether the Committee is in possession of those submissions?  Mr Chairman, if I may just show you it, it's on a PAC letterhead, signed by Patricia de Lille on behalf of Mr Mike Mondane.",

The issue regarding Mr Mpahlele will probably be raised at the end or at some other time this morning. - no, possibly I can raise it now because I think Miss, I think Advocate Collett before Mr Jimmy Jones' call, I think is going to address the Committee.  I want to tender a letter directed to Mr Theo Mabusela, the PAC Constituency Office in Cape Town, of 19 March 1998, which basically led to the submissions being sent to the TRC, where the Amnesty Committee raised certain concerns with the PAC regarding Mr Letklapa Mpahlele.  May I hand that up?\n\tAnd then finally, we are in possession of the judgment in the High Court, Bisho, under case CC01/97.  It was a judgment handed down by His Lordship, Mr Justice Dlodlo in Bisho, and that's dated the 15th of March '99.  In the judgment it is clear that the two applicants were convicted of the three murders, or the murders of Mr Buck Shindege(?), Mr Anvari and Mr Rasavi, as well as a count of robbery.  I ask that these documents - if the Committee deems it necessary to mark them, be handed up.\n\tAnd just finally, Mr Ntonga will lead Mr Tjabane's evidence as his legal representative.

I was only informed last Wednesday of these sittings before the Amnesty Committee this week, by Ms Ntanga.\n\tThe second thing is, I received no correspondence whatsoever that Letklapa had not received his subpoena, had said that he was not going to testify, and at all stages I was under the impression that he was under subpoena and would be here today to testify.\n\tAs I understood it, last time we were at the hearing, Mr Chairman, it was the Committee's desire that Mr Letklapa should come and testify in view of the fact that I handed in certain testimony that he had given in the Bisho High Court.  I didn't understand that Mr Jones' evidence was as important to the Committee as that of Mr Letklapa.  \n\tI believe that in view of the fact that Mr Letklapa's not here, and I was not privy to any of the discussions that took place in Pinetown, neither was I informed thereof until today when my learned friend has just addressed the Committee, I believe that my clients stand to be prejudiced if Mr Letklapa is not here to give evidence in view of the fact that I have seen Mr Jones' affidavit and seen the nature of the evidence that he is to give.

What appears to be a bit of a thorn in the flesh is that the armed struggle had been suspended at that time and their actions are thus being questioned on that basis.\n\tThe applicants' case is essentially that these orders were given to them by Jimmy Jones.  On a somewhat smaller scale at the trial Court, Mr Mpahlele who is presently a Director who was the Chief of Operations at the time testified in the High Court and stated:\n(1)\tthat such an attack as the Bahai Faith Church\n... and I would ask the Committee to read into that the Highgate Hotel, the Da Gama incident and the Nahoon Dam incident - would have been in line with APLA policy.

And in that regard I've made reference to page 14 and 15 of the transcripts, Exhibit J that was handed in to the Committee, of Mpahlele's evidence.\n\tIt's my submission that they did make full disclosure as required by the Act.  They gave great detail as to what happened, how it happened, why it happened, and specifically stated that although the armed struggle may have been suspended, they still received these orders and they acted upon them.\n\tWe now have the testimony of Mr Tjabane, which is in direct conflict to that of the applicants, but in addition thereto it is also in conflict with the evidence tendered by Mpahlele at the High Court in Bisho. \n\tOne matter that I would highlight is the fact that Mpahlele said that as Director of Operations he was briefed about the mission that had happened at the Bahai Church and there was no doubt in his mind that the accused in that case, the applicants here, had acted in terms of lawful instructions and that he could not find anything unlawful about what they had done.

And that will be found at the bottom of page 17 of Exhibit J.\n\tNow this flies in the fact of what Mr Tjabane has just told this Committee because he says that he told Letklapa Mpahlele that this had taken place and it was unlawful because he had communicated that the armed struggle had been suspended etc., etc.  Now both parties acted, I mean testified under oath, one in the High Court and one here.  And I submit that if one has regard to the evidence of Mandla Palapala as well in the High Court, who had nothing to gain, he's neither an applicant before this Commission, neither was he an accused before Court.  He testified that after the alleged incident, the Bahai Faith Church, they went back to the Coloured township and the matter was reported to Jimmy Jones alias Xholile Tjabane who is before the Committee today.\n\tI would ask the Committee to find that orders were in fact given by APLA.  At worst on the evidence before the Committee, if Tjabane did not give the orders, somebody did.  And I'd hang my hat on what Tjabane said in his evidence early on when he said basically that they might not have heard of the suspension and they acted like they did.  In other words he insinuated that commands might have come from somebody other than him.\n\tThe difficult situation is, Mr Chairman, that most of the persons that are involved, and I refer to TNT who is dead, he would have been the field commander, he would have been the person who could have come here and told us that this or this happened.  Essentially Tjabane is here as a single witness, his testimony conflicts with Mandla Palapala, his testimony with Mpahlele, his testimony conflicts with both the applicants before you Commissioners.  And consequently it is my submission that the likelihood is that taking all the circumstances into consideration, that these people did act, these applicants did act on instructions from a commander of APLA.\n\tThey in their own way attempted to bring about some form of reconciliation between themselves and the victims, they apologised to the victims, they attempted to answer all questions as well as they could in the circumstances.  And it's my submission, Mr Chairman, that their acts were political, they were performed to obtain a political objective, the political objective was the furtherance of the policies of APLA.  Despite the fact that the armed struggle might have been suspended, I submit that it was a neutral factor at that stage because on Mpahlele's evidence given at the High Court, this had not been communicated to their base, so they were still under the guise of committing whatever they did in the name of the policy of APLA which was the armed wing of the PAC at the time.\n\tIn the circumstances, Mr Chairman, Commissioners, I would ask that you find that the applicants before you have made full disclosure and that they qualify for amnesty in terms of the Act.

            "Thank you, Mr Chairman. On behalf of the victims in the four incidents under the scrutiny of this Committee for amnesty.  Mr Chairman, some remarks regarding random issues that cropped up.  We have a situation where I submit the proximity to the general elections in April 1994 is a very strong feature or factor which must militate strongly against the credibility of both applicants when they say or they want you to believe that they had no idea that the armed struggle had been suspended.  We have the direct evidence of the camp commander, Mr Tjabane.  He certainly was not severely or to any extent in my mind, materially discredited on this particular aspect.  I think it is common cause and well-known that during March, especially around the latter part of March, the entire nation was galvanised into preparations for the elections.\n\tNow I would gladly concede that if we were dealing with a terrain for example, like Burma or the Koreas where we know from World War II, 30 or 40 years later people emerged from the jungle not knowing that the war had ended, one would say well, one can understand, there was no communication.  \n\tWe have the evidence that the applicants moved freely between Butterworth, the Transkei and the Eastern Cape, they had contact points, Mr Mtura, Mama's Restaurant, they were able to use a telephone, they were able to listen to the radio and they were able to watch the television.  So we don't have a situation that these were combatants cut off from any form of communication with their hierarchy.  \n\tWe also have the evidence of Mr Palapala at page 138 of the bundle, which is a portion or an extract of his evidence in the High Court at Bisho.  He was asked from line 10 onwards, whether he came to know about the armed struggle which was suspended or not and he was being asked that at the time when he was being questioned why he went to East London and Mdantsane for purposes of obtaining a vehicle, and he said at the bottom of the page from line 20:\n\"I mean I was staying there at the camp, at the base rather.\"\nHe was asked by Mr Christoford(?):\n\"Did someone tell you that?\"\n\t\t\"I was told.  We were discussing this at the base and we had heard about it over the radio.\"\nThat with submission, corroborates what Mr Tjabane has told this Committee, that the message had been delivered.  And it would seem from Mr Palapala who was a colleague of Mr Ncamazana and Mbambo at that specific stage, that this certainly was a topic of discussion at that time.\n\tThe other aspect which is indeed troublesome is the motive.  Now the applicants have given the sort of general political motive as wanting to liberate the country from the white oppressor.  At that stage the country was virtually in the hands of the majority.  One by no stretch of the imagination accepted that the ANC would return a resounding majority.  So political motive I submit, doesn't appear to feature very strongly in my respectful submission.  \n\tIf one looks at Palapala's evidence from page 139 of the bundle where he is questioned about the reasons for him going to East London.  He teamed up with accused number 1, who was I think Mr Ncamazana, who accompanied him for purposes of stealing a motor vehicle.  They then join up, with respect, with the others and they go to Cambridge that is in this area, Mr Chairman, where we are sitting at present, and they that they couldn't get hold of a vehicle because the security was tight, there were too many policemen in the area.  They then retired to Mdantsane and there it was said there is a church or a place where white people are and there would be vehicles there.  Then on the Sunday they moved towards the Bahai Church.  Now on the way they first go to a place where they obtained drugs, or frequent a place where drugs are sold, and I think they spend about R20 on obtaining drugs.  We don't specifically know what the drugs are, but Mr Palapala alluded to that in his evidence.\n\tThey then get to the Bahai Church and they see a Sierra motor vehicle, grey in colour, but they don't steal that one because it's an oldish model.  Someone says no, there'll be a newish model or they must wait a while.  They then retire and from the place where they were waiting saw the Jetta motor vehicle being driven towards the church, and that is when they struck.\n\tMy submission is with respect, that this was a robbery pure and simple disguised in order to evade justice by the applicants.  It was convenient for them to say well, we did this on behalf of APLA, we did this on behalf of the PAC, yet the PAC was saying the armed struggle has ended.  And my submission is that Ncamazana at least knew that the armed struggle had ended and that was the instruction given by the High Command.\n\tThe fact that Mr Letklapa Mpahlele gave evidence in the High Court, if one really looks at his evidence what does he say, he gives evidence in general terms.  He as Operational Director takes responsibility, the Bahai Church was in line with APLA policy, it was the type of target that they would have attacked and so on.  He knows that this unit did not get knowledge or have knowledge of the cessation of the armed struggle.  But on what does he base that?  There are no surrounding facts which he gives the Court to bolster or corroborate that.  Here we have the commander himself who has testified that that was not the case. in fact Ncamazana was in the base camp when in fact that instruction went out.\n\tSo generally we have a - certainly the impression I get is that Mr Letklapa Mpahlele is trying to assist the applicants to either be acquitted or to receive a lesser sentence, in my respectful submission.  Because there is nothing really in his evidence, apart from his speculation that there was difficulty in the word getting down to grassroots level, which one I think has certain difficulties accepting in the light of these particular circumstances of the evidence of this case.  It's unlikely and improbable that Mr Ncamazana and Mr Mbambo did not know about the cessation of the armed struggle.\n\tAnd if one argues that away, what is left for them?  Then one must question their evidence, have they then made full disclosure, have they not attempted to mislead this Committee by packing the blame on Mr Tjabane?  It's convenient to say we acted on his instructions in order to avoid the consequences of their terrible deeds.\n\tMr Tjabane made application for amnesty, he could have spelt out what he did, he didn't.  The suggestion by counsel that the reason now that he denies it is to avoid prosecution, he may well be prosecuted, he may be investigated, he has not guarantees in that regard.  What I'm simply suggesting is that it seems unlikely from the fact that he applied for amnesty, even in general terms, that he was trying to protect himself.\n\tThe other aspect relating to Mr Tjabane is the question of the letter Exhibit F.  In the light of what was stated by Mr Mbandazayo it is clear that if Mr Tjabane had given evidence as he testified today, it would have severely impacted not only upon the trial of the two applicants, but also possibly on the hierarchy of the PAC.  And it would seem that that letter was drafted for a specific purpose, was to avoid having Mr Tjabane testify. \n\tNow there may be certain sequelae or consequences flowing from that and it may not be the task of this Committee to pronounce upon that, but Mr Mbandazayo was clearly at unease when he said the way in which it was drafted it was clearly for tactical purposes and to keep him out.  We don't know whey the State advocate did not pursue it and ask for more particularity, but the nett result was that Mr Tjabane never testified and the prejudicial information did not land before the Court.  However, this is not a trial, this is an inquiry, it is an inquiry after the truth and to obtain the fullest picture possible of the gross violations of human rights which occurred.\n\tMy submission is that although in strict legal terms a letter written on behalf of someone must be attributed to that particular person.  However, in these circumstances it is clear from the tone of the letter that Mr Mbandazayo drafted that letter in legalese after consulting with the PAC's senior counsel and upper structures in order to politically make the best statement possible at the time and to avoid the political consequences, or possible fallout resulting from the testimony of Mr Tjabane in that trial.\n\tMr Tjabane has come today without fear, without any reservation, he's exposed himself to all sorts of questions.  And my submission is that whatever criticisms one has of the way in which he answered certain questions, whether he properly understood the gist and soforth.  One aspect was where he didn't reply to Mr Chairman's question of:\n\"In the light of what you say, is it not then correct that Mpahlele must have been mistaken or not telling the truth.\"\nYes, he did not reply directly, but it would flow from the evidence that he gave it was implicit that Mpahlele was not correct or not telling the truth.  With submission it's a conclusion that the Committee must come to, it wasn't the fact that he would answer aye or nay.  His opinion with respect is irrelevant to these, to the weight to be attached to the evidence, whether he believes ...(intervention)",

This Committee must then decide whether that can be accepted in the light of denial under oath by Mr Tjabane.  But where he says that he heard of the cessation of the armed struggle, that supports Mr Tjabane.  And I'm using those aspects to support or to indicate to the Committee that Tjabane can be relied on on those aspects.\n\tWe turn to the question of what happened at Bahai.  My submission is that if one looks at all the information before the Committee, the underlying motive was robbery and nothing more.  We also heard from Tjabane that a lot of the people were angered at this indication by the hierarchy to cease the armed struggle.  And he also indicated that possibly there, people or groups splintered away from the acceptance of that instruction and carried out deeds on their own.\n\tI think the question of anger also was mentioned in the public submissions by the PAC, that the members were angry - I wasn't going to particularly refer to that, maybe I can come back to that briefly.",

The Committee will still be seized with the facts that the armed struggle had been suspended and then maybe the conclusion is that Tjabane was acting for reasons of his own, for personal reasons.  But what we're saying is that we've got evidence from Palapala who says at the base he heard about this, they discussed it, they listened to the radio.  That supports what Tjabane has said.\n\tSo it would seem unlikely that Tjabane in the light of his evidence and supporting testimony, would have in those circumstances still continued to give orders to carry out the attacks when he was reporting back and in liaison with the High Command.  And as he has said unchallenged, his evidence, that he was also preparing for the elections.  It was never suggested to him that he had another agenda.  So this would be speculation, with respect.\n\tMr Chairman, the remaining matters would also fall into the same category.  Obviously they are of a less severe nature in the sense that although the attacks were on people, no-one died in those incidents and I would ask the Committee to also view those incidents on the same basis as the Bahai Faith Church.  Thank you, those are my submissions.",

            "Just one or two things, Mr Chairman.\n\tMy learned friend can't have his cake and eat it.  The learned judge in the judgment of the Bahai Faith Church specifically said that Mandla Palapala was an unsatisfactory witness and the only evidence that he was prepared to rely on was to do with the robbery of the motor vehicle and things that flowed from that.  If that is the evidence that was accepted by the judge in that Court, part of that evidence was the fact that they went to Jimmy Jones alias Xholile Tjabane after the incident had taken place.  And that flies in the face of what that witness has testified here before the Commission.\n\tThe other thing is, with respect, Mpahlele's evidence isn't just in broad terms, he specifically stated that this mission was reported to him, he specifically stated that these people regarded the instructions that they had given as lawful.  And in that regard I refer you to page 25 at the bottom of Exhibit J.  And in addition to that, most of the testimony of Mpahlele is in direct conflict to that which Tjabane has come and brought before this Commission.\n\tNow Mpahlele was free and was in fact subpoenaed to come and testify.  If he wanted to say anything different to what was in this record, well then he should have come and said it and he hasn't.  In those circumstances we have his sworn testimony before the High Court, and the learned judge in that Court did not reject that testimony.  The finding that he made at the end of the day was based on legal principles.  He said he basically accepted that there was an order that was given, but he said that on the legal, based on law the accused should have regarded that instruction as being manifestly unlawful, not that they did, that they should have.  And it is for that reason that they were found guilty.\n\tAt the end of the day, Mr Chairman, the fact of the matter is that they carried out instructions in line with APLA's policy, that those instructions were communicated to the Chief of Operations, that the Chief of Operations knew that they  did not know that the armed struggle was suspended, and that the Chief of Operations said he found nothing unlawful or out of line with APLA's policy in what they had done.  In other words, they had furthered the aims of APLA.  And those are my submissions.",

So this process he treats with contempt.  \n\tThe other aspect is that I wonder if the judge's view would have been the same if Mr Tjabane was allowed to testify as he was subpoenaed to do.",
