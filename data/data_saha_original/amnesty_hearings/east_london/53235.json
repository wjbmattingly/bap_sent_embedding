This became the major form of conflict in the post-world war 2 period, and can be described as a modern adaptation of total war, with the progressive application of political, economic and psychological resources combined with varying degrees of violence and military action.  There are numerous definitions for revolutionary war, which in essence all describe it as a conflict in which wide-ranging and radical change in the political, social and economic field are brought about through the use of violence.\n\tBasically, revolutionary war is the pursuit of the policy of a politically inspired and organised group inside a country by all means available, also with outside support.  Success is obtained by the creation of a situation of instability and political intolerability through a war of attrition, thus producing a climate of political collapse or acceptance of a negotiated solution, without necessarily defeating military opponents on the battlefield.\n\tStrategically, revolutionary war is aimed at a total indirect strategy where the revolutionary forces as the weaker side, assume the tactical offensive at selected times and in selected forms and places.  Armed action is used, but on a lower scale than in previous wars.  The psychological weapon is a major factor because the conflict is essentially a struggle for the allegiance and active support of the populations.\"",

No revolution can succeed if you don't have the population on your side.  Perhaps that was the strongest pillar.\n\t(c)\tThe armed offensive.

The last three, so-called \"sem\" power bases are also known as the prosperity power bases.\n\tAs far as the 80/20% principle is concerned here, this principle was for the first time used by a Frenchman in the war in Algeria.  It was identified by him as on the hand indicative of the fact that the counter-revolutionary effort as well as the revolutionary effort should be aimed at the 80%, namely economic, political and social, and that the security power base only rates at a 20% degree of importance.

Those last three form a so-called welfare aspect of revolutionary warfare and the security component or the power base has an operational and information component.  Overarchingly the security component was managed by what was known as the \"FYKOM\" or the Security Committee.  \tThen there was a joint operational centre for operations, meaning the joint operations of the South African Police and the South African Defence Force or joint operations between the Defence Forces of the Transkei, Ciskei and the Republic of South Africa.  In the same say there was a Joint Information Centre, the JIC, where information was collected and co-ordinated.\n\tThe psychological component of the power base.  That typically, according to revolutionary warfare, had three components, namely the protection of the own forces, also of the population as a whole, and then the attack of the enemy's moral.  This psychological component was mostly waged by means of discrediting actions and pamphlets, communication actions etc.\n\tThen the 80/20% principle.  The 80% was the welfare area of this war and the 20% was the security aspect of it.\n\tThen the management of the power bases.  That was what was important.  The State or the public section tried in co-operation with other parties, tried to stabilise the security component and the psychological component, to prepare the populists to defend themselves, and on the welfare section, to normalise.   And the enemy on the other hand, in this case the ANC/SACP alliance primarily, by means of violent actions and non-violent actions tried to destabilise the security component and tried to create an abnormal situation as far as welfare is concerned and also to undermine our moral psychologically.

It had a long history as a nation, from resistance against the Zulus and the whites and the urge for self-determination was very deeply rooted in the Xhosa nation.  That was actually strengthened by these leadership or leader, leading figures that I referred to.

In other words, it was a visible sign that the policy hadn't worked.  In this State there was even more than latent instability, and of course that stimulated the revolution in this area.\n\tIn paragraph (c), there I say that the Ciskei and Transkei are part of the Eastern Province and things were not very sound in the Eastern Province at that stage.  Then I say that in military terms the Eastern Cape should be seen as one theatre of war and should not be seen as three different military fronts.\n\tParagraph (d), there I refer to the inability of the government and its instruments, especially at a regional level, to combat the escalating and worsening situation of unrest in the country and in the Eastern Cape.  And that let, in the Eastern Cape especially, to a growing feeling of defeatism, even amongst the whites.\n\tAt the same time, in the mid-80's, there was an economic collapse or decline, Ford and other factories closed down in the Eastern Cape.  And as I've put it here, there as a whole aura of bankruptcy in the area, there was no feeling that there was a future, that there was something permanent here.  There was a lack of confidence, whites moved away, the property market started collapsing.  And I think the people today would be able to remember, the people who lived here at that time will actually remember how bad it was.\n\tIn paragraph (e), what I say is that we tried to activate resistance movements as a front to counter the revolutionary forces and we tried to keep this alive, the resistance movements which we tried to foster amongst the moderate blacks, but it didn't actually work.  They were intimidated and infiltrated by the enemy.  And then, it was really a disturbing thing for us to try and fight this political war in the Eastern Cape, because we didn't have very good dynamic National Party politicians in this area to help us fight this war.  I just felt that I actually wanted to convey this to my chief.  \n\tSo these factors in paragraph 6, well I said that they were eroding the prosperity and progress in the Eastern Cape and that like with an iceberg, it's the portion which is not visible, which is massive and the full extent of that, I don't think that was truly familiar and known to the people who had to make decisions.\n\tPerhaps optimistically I say the situation is serious but not entirely lost and that things look darker than they actually are.

He was very powerful, in that time as well, and I think he expressed the sentiment that he wanted to see this unity of the Xhosa nation during his lifetime.  He felt very strongly about that, and it made quite an impression on me, that this old statesman still desired this unity of the Xhosa nation.\n\tGeorge, his brother was also very dynamic.  He was a very good leader as far as I was concerned.  He was the first Minister, Minister of Defence, and he endorsed his brother's sentiments. \n\tNamba Sebe was the Ciskeian Minister of Transport.  He'd been kicked out by his half-brother, Lennox Sebe and he sought asylum in the Transkei.  He often told me that he hated his brother, or his half-brother.  Charles Sebe was his blood-brother.\n\tAnd then there was Reverend Kaba, he was the former Deputy-President of the Ciskei.  Lennox Sebe also kicked him out and he also achieved or sought asylum in the Transkei.  There were other figures as well, but those were the main figures on the Transkei side.\n\tOn the Ciskei's side there was Lennox Sebe, President Lennox Sebe.  He was seen by us, the whites in the RSA, as a thorn in the flesh as a result of this demand for land and his various statements and his instability.  He was quite an unpopular person, he was unpopular in his own country, and he was suspected of being corrupt and there were investigations done, and I think a case of corruption was investigated against him.  He was very afraid of his brother, Charles.  And then of course there was Charles Sebe who was the Chief of the Security Forces, half-brother of President Lennox Sebe.  \tIn August of '83, I think he tried to carry out a coup in the Ciskei, whereafter he was imprisoned in the Middledrift Prison for 12 years.  The coup failed.  However, he was a very powerful man and he had great status amongst the police and Defence Force of the Ciskei and even outside of the Ciskei.  He was very popular as a result of his charismatic personality.  I knew him personally and I had a very good relationship with him.  He was very strongly pro the Republic of South Africa and he also said that he hated Lennox Sebe. \tAnd then there's somebody for whom I had a lot of respect, Chief Lent Makoma.  He was a member of the aristocracy, he was a headman.  He had several cabinet posts.  Lennox Sebe saw him as a threat from the mid-80's, and kicked him out.  Chief Makoma then went to the Transkei.  There he established the party, the Ciskei People's Rights Protection Party, as apposition for Lennox Sebe.  He was also pro the RSA and he was a very eminent Xhosa leader.  \n\tThere was Ray Marley, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs.  He was also detained.  He was moderate, also pro the RSA.  \n\tAnd then there was Sandile.  He was seen as a future chief and he was a confidant of Chief Makoma.\n\tAnd that was, in summary, the key figures on the Xhosa side.",

General Viljoen at some point before he retired as Chief of the Defence Force or Chief of the Army, said to me that it was a pity that such a man was in prison.  There were rumours that he was being maltreated, and of course that led to even more discussion.

We reckoned that this resistance movement could join up with the XWB.  It was the Reverend Mokoena's Black Crisis Centre, and there was the Action for Peace and Prosperity, Sport Resistance organisation etc.  And the whole idea was that all these groups should be joined together into one unified front.\n\tParagraph 6 deals with the Ciskei and the Transkei Security Forces and bringing them closer to each other.  I can remember that we had sport days, we arranged rugby days etc., so that these two security forces could see other as friends and not enemies, and that they could work together with us as an alliance to form a front against the ANC/SACP alliance.\n\tParagraph 7.  We said that the XWB could probably be elevated in status to become the safety wing of Makoma's CPRPP, depending on the party's successes so that one could actually parade these groupings.
