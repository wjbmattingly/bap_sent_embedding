<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">SIBONGILE NDIOKO:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR OBOSE:</span> Mr Ndioko, you are a captain in the South African Police Services, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDIOKO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> You are a captain in the South African police services is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDIOKO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> You know this application relates to the 22nd and the 23rd March 1994, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDIOKO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Did you go to this meeting at Bisho police college?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDIOKO:</span> No, I did not attend the first meeting, but after some time when I heard that there were police that were held hostage I went there as a public relations officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> When you received this news, where were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDIOKO:</span> I was in my office at Bisho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> At about what time did you go to the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDIOKO:</span> I cannot be that certain but I think it was between 1 and 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> When you got to the meeting, what was the mood like in the hall or even outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDIOKO:</span> The people were singing freedom songs.  There were officers who were at the stage and the other members and they were singing, they were in that mood.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Now, what did you then do?  Did you associate yourself with this or did you decide that you won't be party to this singing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> I associated myself with this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Doing what, specifically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDIOKO:</span> When I arrived there I assessed the situation.  I met with two to three people trying to inquire what was happening and then I realised that it was about overthrowing Brig Gqozo's government and I gave my assistance with all I had.  I also formed a part of a delegation that was going to Brig Gqozo's place and I was also a part of a delegation in the morning that was summoned to the Embassy in King William's Town, that was the following day.  All the time during this process I was not far from the stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Did you actually participate in the meeting, give instructions, pose questions, raise issues?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDIOKO:</span> Yes, I was assisting in certain issues, though I was not giving any instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Now, you were part of the delegation to go to Brig Gqozo to do what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDIOKO:</span> The police as it is already mentioned here, some people were appointed to go and call Brig Gqozo to come and address the police.  That is how I got to Brig Gqozo's place.  I was in that delegation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Did you find Brig Gqozo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDIOKO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> What happened at his house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDIOKO:</span> We got into his house and we waited for a moment and he came to talk to us.  Just before we could say anything, he expressed his disappointment, disappointed by the police and soldiers to such an extent that he decided to step down.  That's what I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Now you were also part of a delegation that went to the Embassy the following morning.  Why was it deemed necessary that there be such a delegation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDIOKO:</span> Because we got information, though I cannot say today who gave us that information, that all the departments police should have representatives at the meeting that was going to be held at the Embassy where issues were to be discussed, issues around Brig Gqozo's resigning and the way forward.  I was appointed, myself and Col Mbi, to go there and represent them in that meeting.  That is what we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> What was the nature of this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDIOKO:</span> This meeting was a meeting of the representatives from all the labour unions who were existing at the time and representatives from different departments and the other people that I do not know, but the chairperson was Mr Smuts Ngonyama and Zen Pekas, those are the people that I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Did you see the following applicants in the meeting?  Mr P A Loni?</p>
