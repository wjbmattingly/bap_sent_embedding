Comrade Nqeba, because he was going to be the driver of the car, was seated next to the driver, the owner of the kombi.  Comrade Sky was seated next to me.\n\tWe came across this kombi net to a hotel in Alex, I just happened to forget the name of the hotel.  I already indicated that we were passengers in the kombi, and we drove for a little while and we pointed a gun at him and we told him that he should take instructions from us, because we are not taking this kombi, we are taking it to go and fulfil a mission, and we will tell him exactly on our way, the details of our mission.\n\tYes, he drove down the street.  Towards the end of the street, he jumped out of his car.  We were next to a taxi rank for taxi's from Alex to King William's Town.  The driver of the, the Commander of the Unit which is comrade Nqeba jumped onto the driver's seat, because he was seated next to him, and then he drove.  We carried on with our journey.  \n\tWe arrived at the place where we left the Commander of the Unit, who is comrade Sutha and comrade Dizi.  When we put into the car some of the arms that we were going to be used, we saw lights approaching and we decided to do it very quick, so that we can drive off.\n\tThese lights that were following us, were from the Police in Alice, these are the Police who pursued us.

I don't have any problem being asked on any aspect Mr Chairman, it is just that we must know at least, that you must expect this, that you can be asked questions not on what you have been asked, maybe other things can come up, the Committee can ask you.\n\tSo that is why I am requesting the Committee.  I am not trying to confine it into that, at least we must be aware of that so that we can also tell the applicant to know that he can be asked anything, even regarding his earlier testimony, or his earlier testimony, thank you Mr Chairman.",
