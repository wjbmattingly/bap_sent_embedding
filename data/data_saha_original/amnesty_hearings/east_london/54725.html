<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> ...at a later stage.   Mr Chairman, may I also just place on record, it is now quarter to twelve, and I do apologise for the delay.   However, circumstances outside the evidence leader's control, witnesses who were on subpoena came late to court, there were transport problems from Umtata in the Nqobo area, I believe those have all been ironed out, witnesses are on their way, we can start now and it looks as if we'll be able to finish the evidence pertaining to the Meyer matter today, that's insofar as the evidence leader and the victims are concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>	The question of whether the PAC are going to make submission today, I leave over to be dealt with later on in the day.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>	I now propose to call Dr Magobela, who was the doctor who performed the post-mortem report, or the post-mortem examination on Done Meyers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Shall we deal with the other matter first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> As the committee pleases, that is the Yellowwoods Hotel matter, the matter of Mr Mtembu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>	Mr Chairman, yes, it was proposed that evidence would be led from the ballistic expert, who would give evidence regarding the damage to the buildings and also to the nature of the cartridges found and the type of weapons used in that particular attack, and that matter was to be actually heard tomorrow.   However, Mr Mtembu indicated that he was unable to attend tomorrow for other commitments, and the proposal which was then adopted by all was that the expert, Mr - I think it's Captain Vic - I forget his surname, but anyway I was in contact with him, he will put up an affidavit explaining his evidence and with specific reference to the points of damage that he found on the building relating to the plan and to the photographs, and that document will then be given to the interested parties, particularly Mr Mtembu, for his comment and barring which it will then be presented to the committee on that basis, therefore doing away with the need of leading viva voce evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In consequence of that, we have excused him from further attendance in September?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right, we turn now again to the applications of Zama Tuta and Nogawaya Kulman, but before proceeding with the evidence today, I would like to cause a correction to be made to the record at page 1075 where a remark by me reads</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>"The committee remains the same, with myself, Judge Wilson, as chairman, Advocate Gcabashe still acts and Mr Sandi."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>	Quite clearly what I said was:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>"Advocate Gcabashe, Mr Evan Lax and Mr Sandi", and they have omitted Mr Lax's name as being a member of the committee.   Can I request that that be altered and to confirm that it is still the same committee, consisting of the four members' names sitting today?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Ask that Dr Magobela be sworn in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR PRIOR:</span> Doctor, do you prefer to give you evidence in English or in any other language?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> I prefer to give my evidence in English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you.   Is it correct, Doctor, that you are a medical practitioner, qualified medical practitioner, and at present you are practising in the East London area and East London?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, it is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And is it correct that during 1993, and in particular on the 31st of August of 1993, you were the - were you the district surgeon for the area of Umtata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, it is correct that I was the district surgeon then, namely in the area of Umtata.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And is it correct that on the 31st of August 1993, at about 9:30 a.m., you conducted a post-mortem examination on the body of Done Meyers, a female, aged 21 years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, it is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And is it correct that you recorded your post-mortem findings on the official form, Health 1, Mr Chairman which has been already referred to as Exhibit D in these proceedings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, it is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And you have a copy of Exhibit D before you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> I have a copy in front of me, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Do you confirm the findings recorded therein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, I confirm the findings recorded therein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And these findings, were they made contemporaneous with your examination, or soon thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, it is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So you were recording the findings as you were doing your post-mortem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, I would record my findings as I'm performing the post-mortem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And you adhere to the findings as they appear in Exhibit D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Doctor, your chief post-mortem findings are set out in paragraph 4 of page 1, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, it is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> What interests me and the committee, the cause of death was the gunshot wound to the head, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, it is correct that the... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And in sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 4, you indicated that there was a completely crushed skull?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Are you able to give us an opinion as to how suddenly or how soon death would have ensued after sustaining such an injury to the head as you found on the body of Done Meyers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Death would have occurred instantaneously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The stab injuries that you found, were those, are you able to form an opinion or give us an opinion, I know it's a long time afterwards, but whether they were fatal in any respect or not?   If you look at page 2, paragraph 4, there were, I particularly am avoiding the laceration, but referring to the incised wounds, there was a one centimetre long incised wound on the interior part of the right side of the neck, there was a one centimetre incised wound on the right lateral part of the neck, there were multiple incised wounds on the thorax, and you depict those clearly on your diagram of the chest and abdomen.   Were those incised wounds life-threatening in any way?  Are you able to form an opinion on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> I wouldn't say that they were life-threatening, I would say what was life-threatening is the head injury.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> But would you agree that those injuries were to -that the incised injuries were to certainly vulnerable areas of the body, the neck and chest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, I will say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Are you able to express an opinion as to what caused the incised injuries, in contra-distinction to the penetrating injuries, the penetrating wounds?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Well I would say the incised injuries were caused by a sharp object.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And the lacerations, you... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Usually lacerations are usually blunt objects.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Which caused the skin to burst or break?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, which caused the breaking of the skin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Doctor, I need to ask you this question and it's simply to assist, in my view, the misconception that there may have been some or any form of sexual misconduct, I noticed on the final page, page 4, the genitalia were examined and you noted there a comment "unremarkable"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Were you satisfied that there was no indication of sexual assault or rape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, I was satisfied that there was no indication of rape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And the history that you were given, was that consistent with your finding that there was no sexual assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BOTHMA:</span> Doctor, just to come back to the question of the gunshot, was it only one gunshot to the head itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Well it is difficult for me to say that there was only one gunshot to the head.   It is possible that there may have been more than one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> But then it was all at the same sort of, same entry or around the same entry wound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Same area, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Same area.   And then on page 1, Roman (iv), paragraph Roman (iv)(f), you're referring to the collapsed lung.   What was the cause of that, the stab wounds or was it the gunshot wound?   Roman (iv) on the first page.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> I would say that was the cause of a sharp object to the thorax.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> In other words parts of the stab wounds to the chest area itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Thank you, Doctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BOTHMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Doctor, one portion of my question has been covered by Mr Bothma, it will be only one question and that's a matter of clarification, you told the committee that an incised wound was caused, possibly caused by a sharp object and laceration by a blunt object, are you saying to the committee that there were two different instruments, two different instruments were used to the body of the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MBANDAZAYA</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Doctor, if you look at the first page of the diagrams, what I have of the first page, you show there incised lacerations on the right-hand having an entry and an exit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> I don't see it, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's the second-last page of that report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, I can see it here, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would that have been a bullet wound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> It is possible, Mr Chairman, that it could be a bullet wound, since it's a laceration.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you show on the diagrams, on both pages of diagrams, an injury of some sort underneath the left eye, there seems to be some misunderstanding perhaps on the second page, because there's a long line leading away from it and it says "2,5cm laceration, sole of foot, 150", sorry, "150cm from sole of foot"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, that is the distance between sole of the foot and also the laceration.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now what sort of injury was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> It was a laceration, it was a break in the skin due to a blunt object.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now was that the entry wound described as on the left maxillary area?   At the bottom of page 4 of the report</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>"Entry wound noted on left maxillary area, fracturing maxillary bone and floor of left anterior cranial fossa, entering brain and..."... (intervention).</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, that is so, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that the entry wound of the bullet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> It was the entry wound, yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That blew the skull to pieces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And would have caused immediate death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Unfortunately, whoever prepared these, didn't bother to photostat the other side of the page.   You continued and said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>"See Annexure, p.t.o."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>but p.t.o. is a blank page.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you are satisfied that is where the bullet went in, it went up through, shattered the bone there, shattered the bone at the base of the skull... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> At the base of the skull.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...and blew the brain out... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...and would have caused immediate... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...death?   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, may Dr Magobela be excused from further attendance and we thank him for coming to the hearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I gather, Doctor, that there are a lot of people waiting to see you back in your rooms and the sooner we excuse you so you can get back to treating them, the better.   Thank you for having come today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">DR MAGOBELA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, I call Inspector Mete(?).   Mr Chairman, Mr Mete will give evidence regarding the arrest, and his statement that he made initially appears at paginated pages 33 to 36 of the bundle marked B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">INSPECTOR METE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Mete, is it correct that you are an inspector in the South African Police Services stationed at Umtata at present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> That's correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> During 1993, and in particular August, were you a, at that time a detective warrant officer in the Transkeian police stationed at Umtata and attached to the Criminal Investigation Department?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> That's correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Is it correct that in respect of the Mike and Done Meyers murder, you made a statement under oath, which was attested to on the 17th of January 1994 before a commissioner of oaths?   I'm referring now to the statement that you read out this morning, or you read over this morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Mr Chairman, sorry, I need to give the witness a copy of that statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> It's in bundle B, Mr Bothma, that's bundle A, sorry.   Do you want to use mine?   Mr Chairman, we do have a, Mr Bothma and I will share my copy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> All right, thank you very much, I think it will be safer, let the witness have his statement in front of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Mete, is that correct, the statement which is marked 34 and 35 in the bundle is the statement that you read over this morning and it is clear that you made that in January of 1994?   Sorry, Mr Chairman, there doesn't seem to be any sound coming through the...   It's back on now, can you hear us?   Thank you, Mr Chairman.   Mr Mete, can you hear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> I can hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.   Can I proceed?</p>

<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Can you hear me now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, all right.   Is it correct that the statement you have in front of you, which is marked in black 34, 35 and 36, is the statement you made in this matter during the criminal investigation on the 17th of January '94?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> That is so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And you read it over this morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> That is so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now, Mr Mete, I simply want to, I don't want to get all the detail, because we can read it through ourselves, you did certain things regarding the report of this robbery of this vehicle.   I want you to take the committee through your evidence from the time that you got back to the scene where the truck was parked and there was a flashing blue light and you saw Lieutenant Magadelela, as he then was, and specifically relating to your dealings with the two applicants, Mr Kulman and Mr Tuta.   Can you take us from there, what occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> Yes, I can do so.   When I appeared from the Umtata Police Station, I saw a truck standing facing the Idutwa(?) direction, I'm sorry Umtata direction, though it was supposed to be facing Idutwa.   When I got to it, I got traffic officers standing in front of it and the two applicants, together with the traffic cop standing in front of that truck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>	Opposite that road, there was a car, a grey car, a Ford Sierra, flashing a blue lamp.   Next to that car was standing Mr Magadelela, who was the lieutenant, who is a superintendent today.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>	When I got there, I passed the traffic officers and I talked with the two Africans and asked them as to, "Where is that white lady who was in this truck?"   There was no answer that I could get.   What happened, I saw Mr Tuta making some movement towards his waist.   In my thoughts I thought he might be having a gun and I dived towards him and grabbed him.   There was a scuffle and it was apparent that he was trying to reach to his gun, and we were both trying to reach towards this gun.   To his unfortunate situation, I could overpower him and I could then take this gun from him.   After I took that gun from him, I tried to search him.   On his body, under his manhood, I found money in bags.   I took all of those and gave those to Superintendent Magadelela and that gun.   It was not long thereafter, after this, a helicopter arrived that had Murder and Robbery Squad members.   One of them was taken, who I did not know who it was.   That was the last time I saw them.   That's what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Could you look at the revolver I now show you, it's a 357 magnum, a Trooper Mark 3?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> Yes, this is the gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What exhibit number?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I think it was Exhibit 1, it's the only physical exhibit that we've handed in, Mr Chairman.   Thank you.   Are you able to tell us how much money there was, or from your evidence I gathered you never had time to count it, are you able to, at a later stage, find out how much it was, or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> No, I could count it and I never got to know how much it was, but I suspect that it may have been 2 000 or R1 500,00, but I never got to count it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it loose, you say under his manhood, was that in his, the area of his private parts?   How was the money, was it wrapped up in something or was it simply loose notes, or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> It was money, bank notes that was folded under his private parts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I just want to just establish, was it in a packet or was it just the notes against his body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> It was, I think it's in a plastic bag, but it was folded into his private parts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> At the bottom of your statement, at page 2, in handwriting</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>"The suspect was never assaulted at any stage, neither by me or by anybody in my presence."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>It seems to have been added later, or before you signed the statement.   There's been an allegation in these hearings that, from Mr Tuta in particular, that he was severely assaulted at the time of his arrest.   Are you able to, when you were subduing him, you said you overpowered him, are you able to expand on that, did you have to use force to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> I did not beat him when we were in that scuffle,  because at that time one kill us, each one was trying to reach that gun, I only, I strangled him a bit before I could overpower him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You indicate that you had a hand around his neck, or on his throat, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> I did not hear the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You say you had to strangle him a bit, in other words you put your hand onto his throat and squeezed his throat during the struggle for this firearm, is that what you're indicating to the committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you ever go back to the forest near Bashi, where the body of Done Meyers was found?   Did you attend that scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> I did not go where that woman was, a helicopter went there with other policemen.   After that scene, I went straight to Idutwa.   That's where we parted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> In the course of the investigation, the spot where the body was found was known to you, or became known to you, is that right?   I want you to maybe try and give the committee an indication how far by road is that spot from where the truck, sorry, I beg your pardon, yes first answer that question on where the truck was stopped at Idutwa, can you give us that distance, are you able to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> The distance wherefrom do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> From where the body of Done Meyers was found, we understood that was near Bashi, whether that's the Bashi River or some other place, but to where the truck, where you arrested Mr Tuta, are you able just to give us an estimation of how far that distance is as one travels by road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> As far as I know, in terms of what you've just explained, the kilometres in terms of the distance, it could be 50 or 60 from where the body is alleged to have been to the place where I found and where they were arrested from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you.   Were you able to go to the place where the incident started, that was in the... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> The place where this woman's father was killed, I did not go, but because this is my area, I know the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The area where her father was shot and killed, or shot, when they were selling milk at Xhongora or Xhongoga, it's spelt X H A N G O R A, do you know that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> Yes, the area of Xhangora is within the district of Umtata, next to Umtata but in the area of Piki(?) in terms of police operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I understand you went there at the inspection in loco during the criminal trial, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> At the scene, I did not go, in all those scenes I did not go myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I just want to try and get an indication, the distance from that place to where the body was found, if you are able to assist us, if you can't then obviously you can't, in other words from where the truck was parked selling milk, where the initial incident occurred to the area where Done Meyers was found, are you able to give us an estimation of the distance by road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> From the place where the girl's father was found and the area where Done was found, it could be 40, these areas are not next to each other, the place where Done was and the place where they were found, I think it is 50 to 60 kilometres, they are two different, very far off places.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> All right.   Thank you, Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BOTHMA:</span> Mr Mete, you have identified Exhibit No 1, the gun.   An allegation was made during this hearing that when the firearm was retrieved from the deceased, Mr Mike Meyers, it had an AWB insignia on the butt of the firearm.   Can you recall something like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> No, there was no AWB insignia on that gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BOTHMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> For the sake of the record, there is a little gold insignia on both sides of the butt, marked "Colt".</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, maybe for the sake of completeness, under "Colt", there's an inscrip..., it looks like a small engraving of a horse rearing onto its back legs.   Obviously the colt refers maybe to the horse, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> It does, Mr Prior, it's common knowledge of that insignia.   Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BOTHMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Mr Mete, tell the committee how do you know that that is the gun which you took from, or allege you took from Mr Tuta?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> That gun had a written writing on it, it was a Magnum 3.57, there were words written on it, and though I may not remember those words as is, when I looked at it I could remember those words.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Were those words different from any other weapon which were written there, from any other 3.8?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> In terms of 3.8, that gun, which is .38, the one which you normally use is not written Magnum 3.57, the one of the police.   That is why that one is written 3.57 and the words written on it are the ones that I remember having seen on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Yes, that's what I'm getting at, that is there any other gun, no other gun which has the same writing as that one on it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> At that scene there was no other gun written like that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Okay, I agree with you, but my point is that, which goes to my first question, how do you differentiate that particular gun to any other gun which has the same make at that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> What makes me to be sure that this is the gun is because I was the one who was dealing with that Meyers' case and it was that gun that I found in that case of Meyers.  I do not understand that the body of another, another case can be superimposed on the case of the Meyers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Well that was not my question.   In any event, I'll pass that point.   You told the committee that you had a struggle with Zama Tuta on the scene, and my instruction is that that is not correct that you had struggled with Zama Tuta, but you had struggled with Luvoya Kulman, who you have beaten him up, and as a result he suffered severe injuries and is still suffering from that even today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> I do not know Mr Vuya Kulman, I never saw him.   It is the first time that I get to hear about Vuya Kulman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> And that after you have beaten Luvoya Kulman, you went on to beat Zama Tuta?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> I would not have been able to assault someone I never saw, I do not know this person and I did not see such a person.   The person I was dealing with at that time was Zama Tuta, and the person who was moving with him was Maxwell Mima.   I do not know of Luvoya Kulman, and if he was assaulted saying that he was beaten by me, I would not be sure of that, because I never saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Okay, thank you.   Mr Chairman, for the sake of clarity, before I follow up that question, I want to explain that Maxwell Mima, as he mentioned that he knows only Maxwell Mima, Maxwell Mima is Luvoya Kulman, Mr Chairman.   Yes, Inspector, definitely I'm talking, I thought that you know the name, I'm talking about Maxwell Mima.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> At that time when I was there, nobody was assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Okay.   Have you ever, at any stage in your life as a policeman, never assaulted any suspect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> And you have never heard that policemen assaulting suspects?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> Yes, in courts it does happen that somebody would allege that a policeman was beaten by a policeman, an accused was beaten by a policeman and a trial within a trial would be held.   I never witnessed a policeman assaulting an accused or something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> If you have assaulted them, would you, today would you have said that you did that today?   Would you be in a position to say that you did that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> If I had assaulted them, then I would have had a reason to assault them, I'm sure that something that would not be a secret today, and if I had assaulted anybody, I would have said so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> I appreciate that you will be the first policeman to do that in any event.   Now, Mr Prior mentioned that you inserted in your handwriting that the suspects were never assaulted, which means that it was an afterthought.   What prompted you to insert that, to insert that paragraph, that sentence, that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>"The suspects were never assaulted at any stage, neither by me nor anybody in my presence."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>What prompted you to put that sentence in your statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> Nothing prompted me.   What in fact happened was that this was not included, that the accused or the applicants were not assaulted, and I then decided to include it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Did you not include it because you knew that there were allegations that these suspects were beaten?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Is it a normal procedure that when you write a statement as a policeman after you have arrested somebody, you have to include that he was never assaulted, or do you always do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> Yes, it is a common procedure, so that no allegations are made that the person has been assaulted.   You sometimes would then take this person to a doctor to verify that fact that he was not assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Are you aware that the suspects were taken to hospital after their arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> No, I do not know of such a thing, because I parted with them, unfortunately I was not in that Murder and Robbery Squad section at the time of that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> And let me go to the last point, the question of money.    You told the committee that you retrieved money from Zama Tuta in his private parts, and my instruction and his evidence here was that there was no money on his body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> There was money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Lastly, not least, let me ask you something, which is personal, Mr Chairman, do you know me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> When were you transferred to Umtata from Butterworth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> In 1983.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> '81 you were in Butterworth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> And you were playing rugby in Butterworth, is not that so, a team there in Butterworth, you were playing local team?   I still remember you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> And you used to arrest many people in those days?   If I remember, you were driving a Datsun Laurel (indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> That is so, that's why I do not remember you, there was a lot of people I was working with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Well you were just, I'm not trying to give any evidence, but I just wanted just to make a comment, I'm one of the victims of you, I was once driven by you in your boot of your car as a policeman.   Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> I would dispute that I ever put somebody in the boot of my car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MBANDAZAYA</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> When you were asked about differentiating between the firearms, sir, you said that you were dealing with this case, so you wouldn't superimpose material from one case on another, that's what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> By dealing with this case, what exactly do you mean, did you deal with it only on that day, or did you at a later stage continue to handle this particular matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> I dealt with that case at that time, and that gun I made it at that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> And you never ever handled this case again after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> No, I never again had to deal with this case until I had to go to court about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Mete, I heard your explanation concerning the hand-written sentence that says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>"Suspect was never assaulted at any stage, neither by me nor by anybody in my presence."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>Is a suspect has been assaulted, do you ever write that one down and say, "This particular suspect was assaulted"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> I don't ever get to hear that the person was assaulted, but what happens is, if you arrest a person, or let me say that person is found by the people of the village and he's assaulted, and whatever damage to his body he may have sustained to his body during that arrest, those body injuries are then recorded before he is being incarcerated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> At what stage did you add this particular sentence to your typed statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> It was after I had read it and having had decided, I then took it and wrote that added sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> At that stage had anyone alleged that the suspect had been assaulted, or did you think that such an allegation was going to be made about the matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR METE:</span> No, I did not think that anybody would allege that somebody was assaulted, because nobody was assaulted and I did not think that any such allegation would arise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you, Mr Mete, thank you, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prior, re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> No thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, may this witness be excused from further attendance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I gather that if the need should arise, arrangements can always be made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Certain other duties in the Umtata areas, and he came through.   May we thank Inspector Mete for coming all the way from Umtata to assist us here this morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you and you are now excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, I do have other witnesses coming from Umtata, there was some problem with the transport I indicated to the committee this morning, and having discussed the matter with Mr Bothma, I understand that, in order to save time and not waste and delay any longer, that he would call Mrs Meyers.   So, with the indulgence of the committee, may Mrs Meyers then be imposed, yes, interposed at this time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm as keen as you are to get everything going, but one of the witnesses you intend calling may give evidence about the Meyers' custom or selling milk at certain times, is that something she may want to deal with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> She can also deal with that matter as well, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> She won't have heard yet what the evidence is likely to be.   I merely raise that possible difficulty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I believe we've already called the two witnesses, the two, John Madoda and the other one, who testified about the movements, but the one said he only worked for about a week or so, and the other one - I don't think we'll be able to present any further evidence on the movements itself or the regular movements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, I indicate that the police are bringing somebody, I don't know, I haven't had contact with that person, from the area of where the shooting initially occurred, regarding the movements of the sale of milk.   However, Mrs Meyers, I understand, can also give evidence about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">PAMELA MYRTLE MEYERS:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR BOTHMA:</span> Mrs Meyers, you are the wife of the late Mr Mike Meyers and the mother of the late Done Meyers and you were with them staying on a farm in the Elite district, is it correct so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Now, Mr Meyers used to sell milk in the Transkei area.   Now can you just give this committee some background of the way he normally sold the milk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> He would go down every day.   He would first start in the town of Nqobo and deliver milk to the shops there, then he would go out into the district and he would first deliver at the shops.   If there was any milk over, that the shops hadn't bought from him, he would stop in the villages and dispose of that milk to the individual customers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Did he always follow the same route when delivering milk, or when selling milk in that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> He would go to Nqobo every day, but when he went out into the area, he would never go to the same place on say a set day, he always deviated, like on a Monday, he would never go to the Nqobo area, to the Kofinvaba area, he would deviate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> And what was the reason for his deviation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Because he realised he may be waylaid, so he went there unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Now, the allegation was being made during this hearing that Mr Meyers, Mike, was a member of the AWB.   What do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Mike was not a member of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Do you know whether there were any AWB activities in the Elite district?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> I did not know of any AWB people or activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> The allegation was further made that, according to their information, your farm was used as an AWB base, where training occurred.   What do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> That was not true, I lived on the farm and we did not have any AWB people on the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I further want you to have a look at Exhibit 1, the firearm.   Is it a firearm of your late husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Yes, this is the firearm that my husband had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> And was that the firearm he took with him on that day of his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Yes, this was the firearm that he used to take with him and it was the firearm he had on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> After the court case, this firearm was returned to you.   Was it in the same condition that you last saw it until the time that you recovered it and as it is today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Yes, it is the same firearm, in the same condition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Allegations further have been made that the butt of that firearm had an AWB insignia on that.   What do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> No, it never had an AWB insignia on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Mr Chairman, I'm a bit uncertain at the moment whether we handed in a photocopy of the licence of the late Mike Meyers, and I've also lost track of the last exhibit number, unfortunately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This will be K.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.   Can I then hand in copies of EXHIBIT K then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>PHOTOCOPY OF FIREARM LICENCE OF MR MEYERS HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT K</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Is that the copy of your husband's ID document?  Mr Chairman, the original one is also available here.   Maybe if you'll just have a look at that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Yes, this is the firearm licence of the weapon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Indicating the serial number of the firearm as No 29191U?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> 29291U, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Let's go back to Mr Mike Meyers himself.   His relationship with other people and especially with black persons, can you give this committee some background of the time he worked with them and since when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Mike started to work with the black people of Transkei in about 1974.    We lived in Umtata and he was a salesman for Glenton and Mitchell, selling tea and coffee into the trading stations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>	In 1982, he was manager of the National Foods Distributors, a Premier Milling group in Elite, selling maize, mealie meal, samp, to the traders of Transkei, mainly around the Nqobo area.   For a long time he was the salesman, so he had dealt with the traders personally.   At the Premier Milling or National Foods wholesale, he had about ten boys that he was in charge of, plus the four lorry drivers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>	In 1991 to 1993, he had sold milk to the Transkei, going down every day.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>	Mark liked to trade with the black people and he got on very well with them, so all in all he had about 20 years that he had dealings with the traders of the Transkei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> After this incident, the shooting itself, he was taken to the All Saints Hospital near Nqobo and you also went to this same hospital.   Did you see any of the local people there and met with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Yes, the evening of the day that he was shot, he was in the operating theatre and I was waiting in the waiting room, and many of the traders and family came to the All Saints Mission Hospital where I was.   They gave their sympathy, they showed their emotions, and they expressed and they said, "Please God, don't let him die".</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Can you recall anything, a press statement being made by the mayor of Nqobo after this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Yes, I saw it in the Daily Despatch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> And can you recall the contents of this press statement, or just the gist of it itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> From what I can remember, he condemned the murder on Mike and said that he knew him personally, because he had a garage in Nqobo and Mike always used to go and buy his petrol, his diesel, from that garage, so he knew him personally, and he gave a good report of Mike.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Let's get back to or onto Done, what was her relationship with other people, especially once again the black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Done had grown up on the farm, and as a little girl she played with the black children on the farm.   She also associated herself with the boys that worked on the farm, she would do them favours, when they went to town, she would do their shopping for them, if there were phone calls  and messages to the families, they always went to Done to ask for favours.   Done could speak Xhosa fluently.   I have with me a letter from one of the Transkei milk customers who wrote to her when she went to Cape Town to study for a year.  If you would like to read the letter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> The letter's in Xhosa, Mr Chairman, I don't know if we can use one of the interpreters, it is in Xhosa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> It's in Xhosa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Or maybe you can just give... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Maybe Mr Van der Zi can read it for us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Mr Chairman, it reads</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>"Hi Done,</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>		How are you, are you okay?   I'm all right, there's nothing bad.   How I think of you Done girl.   When are you going to return.   Remember all of us are thinking of you.   We buy a lot of milk.   We buy 200 litres of milk a day.   How is the climate there in Cape Town?   Here in Transkei it's very hot.   Is it nice there at school?   Please study very hard in order to pass at the end of the year.    Thank you very much for writing me a letter.   I apologise for taking time to reply.  Mrs Cochlane said I must pass my regards to you, Mrs Cochlane from the trading stores, Click Trading Stores.   She also said thank you for writing a letter to us.   Please send my regards to your friends.   Hope to see you soon.   Bye-bye, Eunice Mzanza."</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> May I just pass a remark here?   When we - the letter says that "Done, we do "kumbala" you".   That means that we do long for you.   "Sia Kumkhumbula" is what you long for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Mrs Meyers, can you further proceed and tell this commission how did, first of all, let's go to Mike after he was shot and in hospital, how did it affect him, could he attend to the funeral, how long did he live thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> After Mike was shot, he lived for ten days.   He was taken down to the Frere Hospital.   He went through terrific trauma and stress, knowing that Done was dead.   His own physical pain and discomfort of being shot with a shotgun, which didn't kill him immediately, but partly destroyed all organs into which the pieces of shot or bullet came into contact, and gradually they decayed in spite of the medication.   He was distraught that he could not attend Done's funeral, he could not get out of bed or arrange it, the tears would run his cheeks in desperation.   I had to pull out all resources to comfort and to encourage him to get well and to come home.   This was most traumatic for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Did you speak to Mike in the hospital... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> ...about the incident itself, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> He would not speak to me about it, he would just put his arm up to his eyes and he would begin to cry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Could you stay on the farm after this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Yes, I did stay on.   After we had buried Mike, I went back to the farm and I stayed there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> For how long?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> I came to live in East London in 1995, in January.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> And what was the reason for moving away from the farm to East London?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> I could not stay on at the farm by myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BOTHMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.   Mrs Meyers, is it correct that in the run-up to the hearings here in April, you submitted letters on behalf, that you had received from the Agricultural Union, and those form part of the bundle, bundle A, I think, and bundle B, is that correct, I don't intend to go into great detail, they wrote letters to you and you passed them on to my office, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> That's right, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, and they expressed their opinions and there was depositions that were signed by their various members, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> That's right, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I just want to touch on one or two aspects of your evidence.    We heard from the applicants, I don't know if you recall, that when they were taking her from the truck to the place where they ultimately killed her, that she was saying, she was talking English, or saying things in English to them.   You've indicated a short while ago that Done was fluent in Xhosa and in fact corresponded in Xhosa to various of her friends.   Are you able to comment at all on that evidence of the applicants that she was talking English to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> I don't think that she would talk English, or hardly think that she would talk English to them when she could speak to them in her own language.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I want to maybe ask you, when she left the farm on that morning, did she have a jersey with her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Yes, she had a jersey.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Can you remember the jersey?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> It was a navy blue jersey and it had blue stripes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you see that jersey again, that was after the incident, or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> No, I never saw any of her clothes again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Was Done's - did she normally help your husband or her father with the milk round, or the milk route?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> No, she didn't normally go, she went that day because he had hurt his foot and she said, "Dad, I will help you", because it was a 3 1/2  ton truck and she thought when she got to the shop, it would be easier for her to hop down the steps, go into the shop and return.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So are you saying that your husband, Mike, was in some way incapacitated, he had an injury to his foot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> What had happened, do you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> He had been to one of the dairies in the Elite district and a big spanner had fallen on his foot.   It was on a ladder and one of the boys at the dairy had walked up the ladder to see how much milk was in the bulk tank, and... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And he'd injured his foot in that... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> And it fell and fell on his foot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> To what extent had it injured him or incapacitated him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> It was bruised and swollen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And how did that affect his movement, was he able to walk normally or walk swiftly or slowly or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Yes.   He would walk, he would walk on his heel, he would like swing around, he could not put his boot on, he didn't put his boot on, he just had a sock on his foot when he left the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So, do I get the impression, and correct me if I'm mistaken, that he walked with, on the heel with diffi... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> With a limp, with a limp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> With a limp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Hmm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So was that the first, was that the only day, or was that the first day that Done had helped him, or had she helped him before that particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Yes, we had all gone, I had also gone with Mike to sell milk with him, to see the area and to see what was going, and Done had also gone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I get the impression from the evidence that we've heard thus far, is that Done would collect the money, particularly where the milk was being sold in the outlying areas, the people I understand would come with containers, the assistants would then fill the containers, they would then shout the amount of litres or the amount of money to Done and she would collect the money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Yes, that's right, the two boys that worked on the truck would decanter the milk, they would come with the left-overs of the milk, you know, in two litres, five litres or sometimes 25 litres, they would give the empty litre container to John, he would decanter, from there he would hand it to Dodo, Dodo would find the owner of the container, and then Mike would, if Done was not with him, he would keep the money in his pocket, but if we were there, Done or I was there, we would sit on the left-hand side of the truck and give the change or collect the money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And you indicated it was a three ton truck and we've seen a photograph of the truck, I think it was put up in the bundle B.   If the vehicle was standing, for example if the person was standing on the outside, on the road surface, could one see easily into the interior of the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> No, it was high up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And I see on the vehicle there was a step.   Did one have to actually jump onto that step and use that step to actually get into the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> That's right, you'd have to get onto that step.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you ever see the truck again after the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Yes, the truck was brought back to me by the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Are you able to remember, I apologise for asking this to you, I should have asked it from the policeman but it slipped my mind, did you notice whether there was any blood in the vehicle when it was brought back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> They said there was blood, but they cleaned it in Umtata... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> ...before they brought it back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So you never saw any blood?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> I never saw any blood.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How long do you think you'll be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Mr Chairman, I don't think I'll be more than five minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well should we continue, rather than take the adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> I think so, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Continue and allow Mrs Meyers to finish her evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.   Mrs Meyer, accept my sympathy for the tragic loss of your husband and your daughter... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> ...on the (indistinct).   There's one point I want to get to, are you used to his gun, did you ever use his gun, your husband's gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Are you asking me if I shot with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Well, let me rephrase it, whether you were more familiar with it, in handling it, even if you are not shooting it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Yes, I saw it every day when he would, at night when he would come back, he would bring his gun out of the truck and put it next to his bed, and in the morning he would take it with him, I saw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Do you know whether he had any other gun, except that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> He had other guns at the farm, yes, big long ones, but it was only one small gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Small gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Hmm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Now... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think it should be recorded that the number in the firearm accords with the number in the licence issued to Mr Meyers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.   Now, you have heard the evidence, Mrs Meyer, from the applicants, where they said, regarding the whole incident, and why they did it.  Now my question to you will be, how do you feel now that you have heard them, not necessarily that you agree what they are saying, what they did, how is your feeling now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Towards what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Towards them and to what they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> I feel very sorry that they killed my family, I feel very sorry that my family were killed, I'm sorry that they did it, they attacked them, I feel undeservedly, they were helping the people of Transkei by taking fresh milk down to them, they were not, my husband or my daughter or I are not oppressors of black people.   You've heard that my husband worked with the black people for 20 years, he liked to work with them, so he was doing them a favour, he was actually asked by some people in the Transkei to bring the milk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Yes, I've heard that Mrs Meyers, and I don't dispute it, and nobody disputes that, but my point is that now towards the applicant, how is your feeling, after what they have done to your daughter and your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Well, you see, I think my feeling to them is irrelevant, because nothing will bring my daughter and my husband back to me.   They have done what they did and so what can I say?   I'm just very sorry that they did it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> On a point of clarity, Mrs Meyers, are you saying that in that week and in the previous week, Done accompanied her father on the milk round?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> No, it was quite a few weeks that Done didn't go.   Of the week of the accident she went with him on the Wednesday, because he had hurt his foot on the Wednesday, and when he came back, he was limping, on the Tuesday, sorry on the Tuesday, when he came back he was limping, and Done went with him on the Wednesday, on the Thursday and on the Friday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Thank you and then the second question is a slightly different one, your husband always carried his firearm with him when he went on the milk round?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> There were some times that he would forget it at home, but when he carried it, he usually carried it in the safe, just in case there was a roadblock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> And where exactly was this safe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> It was between the seats of the truck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> To his left if he was sitting in the driver's seat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> To the driver's - on the left, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> And the cubby-hole is left but forward, it's not where the cubby-hole is at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MS MEYERS:</span> Yes.   You see there was the driver's seat and two other seats, so the cubby-hole was quite a distance from the driver.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Thank you, thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> No questions, Mr Chair, I thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR BOTHMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I would like counsel's views as to whether they think that that letter should be handed in as an exhibit?   We have had it read out, it has been recorded, and I think Mrs Meyers would rather keep it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I believe so, Mr Chairman, she can just rather keep it and then we've got... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I agree, Mr Chairman, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> I also agree, Mr Chairman, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may keep the letter.</p>

<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll take the adjournment now till two o'clock.   When I say that, I hope I mean it, it depends whether the police will have arrived with the other witnesses by then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...that is that I was today handed a letter addressed to the Amnesty Committee, apparently written on behalf of either APLA combatants or Africanists Prisoners Unity, I'm not quite sure, which the tone of the letter was to complain that TRC does not treat APLA members fairly, it does not release them and that this should be done immediately after hearings.   There's also a complaint about conditions in prison, which I'm afraid we can do nothing about, that is a matter that must be taken up with the prison authorities, but I would like to say that, and I have before me a copy of the letter that was written to Dr Mugaba last week, saying</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>"In terms of resolution 3.1 taken at our meeting of the 22nd of April 1998, the PAC undertook to furnish the Amnesty Committee with a written submission in which the policy of the PAC will be set out and responsibility be taken for the incidents applicants are seeking amnesty for.   You may be aware of the fact that several amnesty applications involving members of the PAC have been postponed until the week of the 25th of May in East London to receive evidence from the PAC or the operational commanders of APLA, one of whom is Mr Letlapa Mahlele."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a>	It then lists the items that have been adjourned to today and it goes on to say:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>"We require the submissions and notifications that someone will adduce this evidence on behalf of the PAC as a matter of urgency to the hearing scheduled to reconvene on the 25th."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a>	Once again there has been no response, although the fax was received, and it makes it almost impossible for us to come to a fair conclusion in respect of the applicants if we do not get this information, and I would urge all of you who are members of APLA or the PAC to request that they carry out their undertaking and supply the submission which they have undertaken to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>	Thank you.   Carry on, Mr Prior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.   I now call Mr Zwelimbanse Makase.   May he be sworn?   Mr Chairman, Mr Makase appears at page 20 to 22 of bundle B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">ZWELIMBANSE MAKASE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Makase, is it correct that you reside in the Zeleni locality in the Clarkbury district - sorry, Zeleni locality, Clarkbury, in the Nqobo district?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now, during October - I beg your pardon, August of 1993, you were at your place of employment, which is their brickyard at Zeleni, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And that is the day that you saw certain things happening, you heard certain things and you were later approached by the police and you pointed out certain spots to the police near the forest, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And is it also correct that you made a statement to the police who were investigating that matter, which you read before you were called, and you signed that statement on the 30th of August '93 at Umtata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You also gave evidence at the criminal trial of the applicants, Mr Tuta and Mr Kulman, also in Umtata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now on that day, which we know is the 27th of August 1993, and it was about two o'clock in the afternoon, you were at the brickyard, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Can you tell the committee what you were doing there at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Yes I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, please tell the committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> I was at that brickyard preparing a stand.   When that truck appeared, I had finished working.   It stopped near the forest.   After it had stopped, a shot rang out into the forest, about three shots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You say you saw a truck arrive.   From which direction did the truck come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> From the direction of Umtata.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You say you saw it arriving and stopping near the forest.   From your position, were you lower down or higher up than the truck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Below the truck, over Mbashe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that near the river?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And the road on which the truck was travelling, was that a tarred road or was that a gravel road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> It's a gravel road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And are you able to say how far the truck was from you when you saw it come into your vision or line of sight and where it stopped near the forest, are you able to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> (Indistinct) the incident occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> How far were you from the truck when you saw where it stopped?   Are you able to point out a distance for the committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> It's approximately two kilometres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You said three shots rang out after the truck had stopped.   What was the next thing that happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> That truck started and came towards me.   It passed by me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Does the road on which the truck had travelled, that is from the Umtata direction past the forest, if you leave it, does that gravel road run past the brickyard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Were you able to see from your position in the brickyard who was in the truck as it came past the brickyard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Yes, I could see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> How many people were in that vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And then did the vehicle leave your line of sight, did it go out of your sight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> It passed near me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Tell me something, Mr...</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a>TAPE CHANGES - WORDS LOST - START OF TAPE 2</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a>...either before the truck arrived at the forest, or when the truck left the forest coming past the brickyard, did any other vehicle, and particularly a bakkie, a pick-up, did that accompany the truck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> There was no car in front of that truck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did any vehicle arrive before the truck had stopped at the forest, that you could see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> No, none.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> From where you were in the brickyard, did you have a clear view of the road which led to the forest and then the road which comes onto the brickyard, I mean can you see that road clearly from the brickyard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> It is very clearly visible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> All right.   Is it correct that some time later, Mr Pangele, Mpangele, from the Umtata Police, arrived at your place of employment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Yes, correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And he asked you certain questions, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you take him somewhere after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> No, I just accompanied him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, to where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> To where the truck stood.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you remain there or did you leave while the police were in that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> I left after I'd given that statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I just want to ask you this question, did you see the body of the young girl that was found there, or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Yes, I saw that body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, I'm not going to pursue this aspect with the witness, I have other evidence to tender on this aspect, I have no further questions of this witness, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY BOTHA</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Mr Makase, where you were standing, or where you were working, were you able to see, or were you in a position to see clearly what was happening, where the truck was standing, was parked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> No, I could not see because that was a forest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> And you could not see how many people were in the truck at the time, when you saw the truck in the forest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> No, I could not see that, because that was in the forest, I could only see those when that lorry passed me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> And you were also not, because it was in the forest, if there was any car, other than the truck, would you be able to see it, if it was on the other side of the truck, not on the, on your side on which you were standing?  Were you going to be able to see it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Yes, I would be able to see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Now, if you were able to see, you would be able to see a car, if you were that distance, what made you not be able to see if there were people who came out of the truck at that place where it was standing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> I could not see, because the truck was in a road in the forest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Can you be able to say that there is only one road where you were?   Are there no other roads which are joining that same road on which you saw the truck travelling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> No, no other roads.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Are you - were there any other cars before the truck went through that road, did you see any other cars in the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> No, none.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> So you did not see the cars, or there were no other cars which passed through that road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> No, no cars.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> You said that this car travelled to the direction of Nqobo, the truck, after it left the forest, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Where you were, in the position where you were, where do you join the road to Idutwa, do you have first to go to Nqobo direction or do you have to go somewhere, to other direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> When you leave where I was, you first have to pass Clarkbury School and then you get a road that shows Idutwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> So what you are telling the committee is that you have first to go to direction of Nqobo before you can to go Idutwa, because they are in the opposite directions, Idutwa and Nqobo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> I heard you saying that you were almost two kilometres, if I'm not mistaken, from where the truck was standing.   Was I correct to say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Then it must be quite - a very long distance, if your estimation is right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> No question was asked, it was a statement, so... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you wanting him to agree with you, Mr Mbandazaya?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, do you want him to confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Okay.   Was it here a mistake when you said in your statement it was about a kilometre away from you, when you told the police about this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> It was not a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> And also it's not a mistake to say it was about two kilometres away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> It is not a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> I have no further questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MBANDAZAYA</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Makase, you were at work on that day, weren't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What time you had you started work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> I used to start at 8:00 in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Had you stopped for anything to eat at midday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you'd been working non-stop since 8:00?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Yes, because I'm working for myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you were building a tank stand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And this, I take it, necessitated you moving around, working from different places, getting the plant and equipment, putting it in position?   Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> No, all of them are in my immediate vicinity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but you have to fit them into place?   A tank stand just doesn't jump into position, does it?   You have to make it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that's what you were doing, and because you were working for yourself, you were doing it as quickly as you could?   You agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Mr Makase, if a motor vehicle had come down that road and made a U turn where the truck stopped, would you have seen that car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Yes, I would have seen it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Are you saying that the entire road was clear from where you were working, all the way back from the place where the truck had stopped, even beyond it, going backwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> And at about what time was this, roughly, when this truck stopped and then passed you a few minutes later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> It was after lunch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> And then the point Mr Mbandazaya was making about one kilometre and two kilometres, can you assist us with that?    Exactly how far were you from this truck, the point where it stopped before it moved forward?   It can't be one and two kilometres?   Just estimate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> I'm approximating it at two kilometres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Now I'm not very good with distances, but to me two kilometres is a long way to be able to identify a particular motor vehicle.   Please help me with that.   Are you saying that at two kilometres, which I would say is way - you know if you had to drive up this road, quite a long way, you could identify a particular motor vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> I could see clearly there, because the road that that truck used is high up in terms of altitude, from where I was standing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Are you saying that you could see it was some kind of motor vehicle, but you didn't know what type of motor vehicle until it passed you?   I'm just trying to piece things together here, to understand this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> I could see that it is a truck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you see what sort of truck it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> I could see that it was a white truck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you see more than that, could you recognise the truck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> No, I could not point out any detail about what type or what model and that type of thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you know whose truck it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> No, I did not know, but it used to pass where we were as we were working there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> But when did you actually recognise that it was a truck that you knew, when it had stopped or when it passed you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> It was when it was coming towards me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Thank you, Mr Makase, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Mr Makase, when you say you saw this truck, do you mean to say that you could see the entire body of the truck, or just certain parts of the truck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> I could only see certain portions of the truck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Which portions were those that you could see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> The upper portion of the truck, as there were trees in that vicinity next to the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is that to say that you were only able to see the top of the truck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Now, if this was a much smaller vehicle than the truck, do you think you would have been able to see it, of the top of such a small vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> I would only see the top of that car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> If, let me explain my question, if it was just a small bakkie, would you have been able to see it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> I see from your statement that you say you did not see anybody alighting from the truck.   What was preventing you from seeing a person coming out of the truck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> What may have made me not to see anybody alighting is because I did not concentrate, I was busy with my work, I only heard those shots in that forest, I did not see anybody alighting from that vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Oh, I see.   You were not really concerned about this truck and what was happening.   I thought you were focusing and concentrating on this truck all the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> I did not concentrate on that truck all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you, Mr Makase.   Sorry, before that truck came there, were you focusing and concentrating on what was happening on that particular part of the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Yes, I was concentrating as I saw that truck as it was coming to pass me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were asked about before you saw that truck there, were you concentrating on that road or were you concentrating on your work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> I was concentrating on my work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> In other words, cars going up and down that road were none of your business as far as you were concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you, Mr Makase.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just one question, Mr Makase, what, in the light of your last answer, what drew your attention to the truck in the first place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> It was because of the shots in the forest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So you heard shots, you looked up from your work and you noticed - you heard shots, you looked up and then you noticed that the truck was there, is what you're telling us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And then that truck then drove past you where you were working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you, chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair, I need just to clarify that last aspect.   Mr Makase, in your statement you indicated that before the shots were heard, you - and your evidence about the two kilometres, you said before the shots were heard, you saw the truck driving on a gravel road, from the direction of Umtata towards Nqobo, and you identified the truck as "the one I used to see being driven by a white man", and that this truck stopped on the road, in your statement you said "about a kilometre away from me".   Can you maybe just explain that in the light of your evidence now, what did you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> I'm approximating the distance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, but the question that the committee put to you now was, were you aware of the truck before the shots were fired, did you see it before you heard the shots fired, or did you only become aware of the truck after you heard shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> I saw a truck that came and thereafter shots rang out and then it passed me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, that's how I understood your evidence, but what the committee, Mr Lax asked you now, seemed to create the impression that you only became aware of the truck after... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It didn't create the impression, Mr Prior, it's precisely what he said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> But, Mr Chairman... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct) he said it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> But, Mr Chairman, with respect... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> His evidence in chief was to confirm his statement.   You cannot change his evidence, he said precisely to Mr Lax that it was the shots that drew his attention to the truck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, with respect, it's obvious that he may not have followed that question precisely, because his evidence now, a short while ago, clearly confirms his evidence in chief, and I think in fairness to the witness, I mean certainly one can't make the suggestion that he's come here to perjure himself, with respect, he has no interest in this matter whatsoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What I objected to was, you said it gave the impression, it wasn't an impression, it was a clear statement by him, Mr Prior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, it was a statement, with respect, but it created the impression, certainly in my mind, that he hadn't seen the truck before he heard the shots, and I want the witness maybe just to have an opportunity to clarify that position, but he's indicated in re-examination that he saw the truck before he heard the shots.   Mr Makase, you indicated that the brickyard is situated near the river, which is lower down from the position where you saw the truck stop in the forest.   Apart from, if one looks in that direction what draws your attention to a vehicle coming on that road in the direction of the brickyard?    Can one hear anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> The reason for me to look on is because whatever appears on that road, you can see, because it's higher up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And where you were working in the brickyard, in which direction are you looking at, or facing, when you're doing your work, are you facing away from the road or to the left or to the right of the road, can you maybe just explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> I was facing the direction wherefrom the truck was appearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And as you indicated earlier, the vehicle would come from a higher position coming down the road towards the brickyard, if it follows that route?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKASE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I call Mr Pangele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MPHAMELO PANGELE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Pangele, is it correct that you are presently in the service of the South African Police Services stationed at Umtata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> On the day of the killing of Done and Mike Meyers, you were, it was on the 27th of August '93, you were in the employ of the Transkeian Police Service at the Murder and Robbery Unit based at Umtata, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now it's common cause that Mr Meyers was shot and later died, that his daughter was kidnapped from the place where they were selling milk and taken to the Bashe River where she was killed, and that that happened in their truck, a three tonner, white tonner truck.   How did you become involved in that investigation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Our control police radio told us as I was travelling in a police van.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> So you got information of this incident that happened at Xhangora, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> All right.   As a result of that, where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> I took the road between Idutwa and Umtata, it was a gravel road going to the direction of the truck as I knew that area well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> All right.   Is it correct that eventually you came to the brickyard at the Zeleni area, where Mr Makase, the previous witness, was employed or was working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you make inquiries from him as to what had occurred there, or whether he had seen anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Yes, I inquired about that truck as I heard about the police radio from Mr Makase.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did he direct you or show you any place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> What he told me was that the truck had passed him, a white truck with a yellow, a grey, a blue roof, and that they had stopped before they had passed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did he show you where the truck had stopped before it had passed him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> I said he must accompany him to where he said the truck had stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And did you go to that spot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Yes, we went to that place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now, at that place, was that near a forest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Yes, in a forest-like place, a (Indistinct) forest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you find the body of Done Meyers there, in that vicinity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Yes, that's where we found a body of a white lady.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> How far from - sorry, let me just establish this, where Mr Makase took you or showed you the spot, was there place for vehicles to park, in other words is it a clearing, is there a space without bush or what, what is the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> No, there was no place where cars could stop.  The truck stopped in the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Okay.   And from that - I'll come back to it, but from the place where Mr Makase indicated the truck had stopped to where the body of Done Meyers was found, can you just estimate how far that distance was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> The distance was not long, it could be 200 metres from where Mr Makase was at the brick place and the place where he says the truck had stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, do you say it was 200 metres from where he had been at the brickyard and 200 metres from where the truck had stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> The distance is not very long, it could be in that amount of metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Sorry, we're trying to clarify which distance you're referring to here, because there seems to be a confusion.   What distance are you referring to, just clarify that for us, this 200 metres, what is that in respect of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> It is the place, the brick place where Mr Makase was working and that is between that brick place and the place where Mr Makase said the truck had stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now what was the distance from the truck, where the place the truck had stopped, to where you found the body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> It could have been about 40, 50 paces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thanks Mr Prior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.   The applicants indicated in their evidence that the young girl, Done Meyers, was taken, carried over a fence to a spot where she eventually was killed.   Was there a fence in that area, in other words did you have to go over a fence to get to the body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Yes, you had to pass a fence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> All right.   You obviously, or let me ask you the question, did you investigate the area, did you search the area for articles or clues or disturbances of the soil or whatever, was that part of your work there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> That is so, yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I understood from our discussion before you gave evidence, that eventually reinforcements and support came, so you weren't the only policeman on that scene, shortly after you got there reinforcements arrived is that correct?  I understand a helicopter also arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I want to show you bundle C, it's the photo-graphs, Mr Chairman.   The photographs depict various positions from, or various places at the scene, you know different angles from which the body was photographed.   Do you confirm that the body of Done Meyers was in that position as you see in the photograph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> That is so, yes, correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I need you to clarify one aspect, possibly two aspects:  the first two photographs indicate that the blue jeans, the denim jeans, of Done Meyers had been unbuttoned;  and then the other photographs 3 and 4, I think indicate that the jeans are closed.   Now I've had the benefit of seeing the negatives which showed the sequence of the photographs, and unfortunately I put up the bundles in the wrong sequence, I just wanted that to be clarified for the committee, when you saw the body for the first time, were the jeans closed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> The jeans were buttoned, as shown in 3 and 4.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Okay.   And I've heard the explanation why the jeans were opened.   Can you maybe explain that just for the committee, because I don't want any wrong suggestion to be maybe levelled at this stage, why were the jeans opened and that photograph taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> When we got there, the body was as is shown in photo 3 and 4 with the trousers buttoned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And the blouse, was it in that position or in another position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> The blouse is as is shown in photo 3.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> It appears to be pulled up, exposing a portion of her brassiere, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes.   Those photographs were then taken.   Now let's go back to photographs 1 and 2, just, you were explaining why the buttons of the jeans were opened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> It was because the jeans were soiled with blood and they wanted to determine as to whether she had been damaged in her private parts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now, in your statement that you made at the time of this investigation, Mr Chairman I refer to page 27 and 28 of the bundle, that is the typed statement, and then his hand-written statement is 29, 30 and onwards, towards the end of your statement you said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a>"Seemingly there was a struggle as I saw the track of the training shoes wearing by the culprits and the scattering of the articles from the truck."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a>Can you maybe just expand on that and explain that, were there signs of a struggle that you could determine from looking at or examining the ground or the terrain there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> I saw a lot of papers scattered around at about where the truck had stopped and marks of training shoes that were in that vicinity in that road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And where the body was lying, were there any, I know it may be difficult after all this time, but is there anything in your recollection that may have indicated a struggle or not?   If you are unable to say that, say that clearly from the beginning and we won't pursue that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> I'm not saying there was a scuffle, but what I'm saying, there was proof of things having been strewn around in that road and the marks of those training shoes in that vicinity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> All right.   Mr Chairman, I have prepared another bundle, it was photographs that had been taken.   Unfortunately there's no index.   I've prepared copies for the committee and if I may mark it L, and if I may also have the committee's indulgence just to take this witness through the ten photographs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I suggest you should mark the first bundle C1 and this C2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I'll do so.   So that is the first bundle C1, and C2.   May I ask if Mr Mbandazaya could be so kind, I only have a limited amount, five, if he could maybe just assist?   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a>BUNDLE OF PHOTOGRAPHS HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT C2</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> If I can go to C1, that's a photo - I beg your pardon, C2, photograph 1, that's a photograph of Mr Tuta, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now, were you there when that photograph took place, or these photographs were taken, or were you at some other place, let's just clarify that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Yes, I was present, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And behind Mr Tuta, I can see clearly a - it looks like a fence, with the droppers and so forth, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Yes, there is a fence there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I just want clarity, was the body found beyond that fence or is that the fence - is that some other fence on the other - sorry, the fence on the boundary of this track where the vehicle stopped?   In other words, if I'm looking in the direction of the photographer, behind Mr Tuta, was the body found beyond that fence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> The body was found beyond that fence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> If you look at photograph 2, there seems to be a wet patch in the foreground.   Are you able to remember what that was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> It looked like a patch of oil where the truck has stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Was that the area indicated where the truck had stopped before the shots were fired, is that your... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> If you look at photograph 3, can you remember what that photograph depicts?   If not, say so.   Yes, it shows a track with rocks in the foreground, it looks like a thorn bush.   Was that just a photograph of the general area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> I cannot recognise that place at No 3.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> All right.   Photograph 4, Mr Tuta appears to be pointing to, it looks like a yellow plastic carrier, or certainly yellow plastic with it looks like something white.  Do you remember that, or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> This plastic looks like a plastic that had fallen from that truck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Okay.   Photographs 5 and 6, they seem to indicate a pathway, a rough path, from the initial positions in photographs 1 and 2.   In photograph 6, Mr Tuta is appearing, apparently pointing, it looks like a dark object, it could be a piece of cloth of sorts.   Can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> No, I cannot remember clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, may I just explain briefly the reason why this, it was simply that there was no proper index and album of photographs could be found from either the police investigation or the court record, so we're doing our best to maybe paint as full a picture as possible, and I was unable to find anyone who could, with any clarity, give me a - make any sense of these photographs, but it seems to be a general pointing out.   Photograph 7 looks like he's pointing to a, it looks like a R10,00 note, a green note, under a stone.   Can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> It looks like R10,00 that may have fallen from that truck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Do you remember that there was money, or a R10,00 note, lying there, or don't you remember, independently of the photograph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> I do remember something relating to money that had fallen down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> All right.   Photograph 8, you had already indicated that documents had been lying there.   It looks like documents, are those documents letters or whatever, can you remember that, photograph 8?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Yes, I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Photograph 9 is a, it also looks like an item of clothing near a stormwater pipe.   Can you recall that, and are you able to identify that piece of clothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> No, I do not remember that place, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> As also photograph 10?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Even 10 I do not remember anything about, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> But is it correct that Mr Tuta was pointing out certain places at that spot where Mr Makase had indicated to you earlier on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Mr Tuta may have been pointing out these places, moving with the photographer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Do I understand from that that you never went, you weren't walking with the photographer when these were taken, but you were in the general area at the time that photographs were taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Correct, I did not move around with the photographer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I need to put this to you, I believe at the last, or I remember at the last hearing in April, there were allegations from the applicants while you were sitting in the audience that you were one of the policemen who assaulted them, in fact you were asked to stand up.   Do you wish to comment, you have now an opportunity to comment on those allegations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> No sir, I cannot comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Well did you assault these people, after they had been arrested and at the spot where they were, obviously there was pointing out done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> No, I did not assault them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see them being assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> No, I did not see them being assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Just to finish off, well for me, this point, but if you look at C2, photograph 1, and you look at Mr Tuta's face, it would appear to me that he had been assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a>END OF TAPE - POSSIBLE LOSS OF WORDS</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> A very, very short time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Roughly five minutes, one hour, just an indication?</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> It could be one hour, about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> At the time that the helicopter arrived there with Zama Tuta, were there some local people there at that point or at that spot, waiting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> No, there were none, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> You cannot recall seeing any local people there at that spot, and their attitude towards Mr Tuta at the time he arrived there?</p>

<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.   Mr Pangele, at what time did you arrive at the spot where the body of Done Meyer was discovered?   Can you still remember the time, what time did you arrive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> It was afternoon, I do not remember the time accurately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Can't you say whether it was three or four o'clock or five o'clock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> It may have been about those times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Am I correct to say that you did not move from that spot until the other policemen arrived with the suspects?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Did you see them on their arrival?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> I saw them, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Did you see the condition of Mr Tuta?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> I saw it, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> And you could see that he has been assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> No, I did not see him as if he had been assaulted, but I could see that he had a torn overalls.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> You did not see that his eye was swollen and almost the right side of his face was swollen, almost closed, the other eye?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> No, I did not notice such a thing, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Is it your evidence that, here in this committee, that what was said by Mr Tuta in the last hearing, that you assaulted him severely, is not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> No sir, it's not true that I assaulted him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> If you had done that, would you have been in a position to tell the committee that you had done that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Yes, I would have told the committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Yes, but Mr Pangele, sorry for the interruption, Mr Mbandazaya, I thought your attitude was to make no comment at all about the allegation of assault until Mr Prior asked you to admit or deny the allegation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> My recollection is, Mr Prior, you invited him to comment on it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, to comment on the allegation that was made in public... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> ...at the last hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and (indistinct) he said he couldn't make any comment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Can I proceed, Mr Chairman, or is it still on the floor?   Thank you, Mr Chairman.   Now in your statement you said that at around half past one on the day in question, you received a message on the radio control, you said it was around half past one.   If it was around half past one, can you estimate to the committee at what time did you arrive at that spot after you have received it at half past one, the message, that there is this incident that took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> I cannot estimate, but what happened that afternoon, me hearing about the whole matter and me getting to the body, I did not see the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Oh.   No, I agree with you, you received the message at half past one, but what I'm trying to get at is what, after you have received the message at half past one, how long did it take you to arrive at the spot where the body was discovered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> I cannot estimate how much time I took to get to the body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> You are also not in a position to estimate the distance you travelled, how long the distance was when you received the message that there's this incident that took place, distance to that spot where the body was discovered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> No, I cannot estimate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> But you are able to estimate that the distance from the brickyard to where the truck is was 200 metres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> Yes, I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Thank you, Your Worship, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MBANDAZAYA</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> The questions I have really relate to the village where the incident occurred.   I don't know if you would be able to assist me with just a few details there.   It's not evidence that you have given.   Can I continue?   Do you know the village at all, where the incident occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANGELE:</span> No, I do not know the place where the incident took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Thank you, then you will not be able to assist me.   Thank you, no other questions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> ...names were supplied to them as persons who had knowledge about the shooting, they were residents in the area, one was a young boy, and one was another resident, but unfortunately none of them arrived at the police station as per arrangements, so they never came through, but I also understand that they were unable to give any indication on the regularity of the route.   All they could say was that from time to time milk was sold in that area, and one can probably expect, after six or seven years, that they would have difficulty remembering with any clarity or any precision the exact route or the exact time schedule that - the selling times by Mr Meyers at that particular time, so as far as I'm concerned, the evidence leader's concerned, I have no further evidence to tender.   I understand Mr Bothma wishes to address the committee and then Mr Mbandazaya also needs to address the committee on further evidence that may be tendered by them.   Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.   We don't wish to present any further evidence, but I was just discussing the matter with Mr Prior now, that there is a court record available of a portion of the evidence, it also includes two witnesses who were on the scene of the first shooting, and as I understood it normally that this committee will have a transcription of the record available and I believe that attempts will be made by Mr Prior to get transcripts of the record available.   What happened is, the case was postponed on a certain occasion and thereafter a second file was opened in the registrar's office and that second file with the rest of the evidence cannot be found, but I'm just wondering whether this is not actually relevant to this committee to have copies available of this record.   I've got only one copy, but I can make it available to Mr Prior to make the necessary photocopies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> The value being that we have some indication of what witnesses who were there might have said to the Court then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> That is correct, ja, especially on the first occasion, at the first scene, where Mr Meyers arrived, two locals from that area were called and they testified what had happened on that first scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, the first scene, you mean when the incidents took place, not when he came, not on the first occasion he came to sell milk there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> No, I was referring to that occasion on that day when he went to sell milk there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Mr Chairman, I don't have a problem, we can (indistinct) about it, but I haven't read it, that's the unfortunate part, I don't know what relevance, but ordinarily I wouldn't have any problem about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> My feeling is that this may be of assistance to us all, I can't say, I have also not read it, but what I do suggest is that it be made available on the somewhat tentative basis that if counsel for the applicants is of the view that it is prejudicial to their interests and should not be considered by us, he can take the point in his argument.   Do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> I agree, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, I certainly endorse the approach that the committee should be appraised of whatever material is available, to obtain as full a picture of the event as possible, and also with the approach that should anything to the detriment of the applicants arise, that it be raised.   However, yes, we will deal with that, if that eventuality arises, but certainly, being an official court transcription, or a portion of the transcription, it should be, or it could be and can be properly admitted as part of the evidence before this committee, and obviously it would be prejudicial on the basis if it was admitted now without proper discovery or notice to Mr Mbandazaya, so I will see to it that copies are made and properly delivered to Mr Mbandazaya and to the rest of the committee in due course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a>	Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.   Mr Chairman, I was talking to Mr Prior about this question of submission from the PAC.   I was talking to him and I heard that it seems as if we are going to always not come to decisions, we will not conclude all these cases waiting and waiting for them to come with this submission and we don't know when.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think rather the opposite, I think that we have endeavoured to give the PAC every opportunity, they have not taken it, that we will now proceed without any further submissions by them.   When I say "without", we will give them perhaps another week, but I gather the matter will be brought to their attention almost immediately, and if they do not take advantage of the opportunity that's given them, we will have to decide without it.   It is grossly unfair to the their members and supporters that they should keep making promises and do nothing, and, as you say, delay, delay, delay, so my feeling is, and I think I speak for all the members of this committee, that we are prepared to say give them a week or until the end of next week to make what submissions they wish to make, but if that is not done, we will have to proceed without it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I was still on that point, I was saying to Mr Prior then I will make my - forget about them myself, I will contact the relevant people like Lethapa Mphahlele, because as I indicated to the committee is that I was waiting for the submission before I can call him.   Now I want to make arrangements with him that he must come and see the committee so that we make arrangement to make this submission on our own, because definitely, also myself, I have a problem, I have been contacting PAC, I can't get hold of them until - luckily for him I'm able to get hold of him now, and he indicated that (indistinct) is in Johannesburg, otherwise he can make, even if the committee is in Cape Town, I can arrange and go with him in Cape Town, wherever it is, so that we can seek the clarity and thereafter we arrange for him to give the testimony at a convenient time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does that mean that he will not be able to be here this week or on Wednesday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> He would not be able to be here on this week.   He was here last week, I understand, and he couldn't get hold of me, and I was trying to get hold of him, and he wanted to come and discuss this thing, but I couldn't.   When I received the message to phone him, I couldn't get through to him and he was around here.   He left Friday night for Johannesburg, and now he told me, I was talking to him over lunch, he said, look, unfortunately he has already committed himself.   I have that problem, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, maybe, just from my side, the evidence leader's side, it's, I agree with the chair, in the circumstances every latitude has been extended, I mean at the end of the day the applicants are the ones who suffer, the onus is on them to present evidence that supports their application, there have been undertakings, but unfortunately it's difficult to schedule hearings around, I don't want to use the word empty promises, but certainly undertakings that are not carried out, the logistical implications, the financial implications are such that we need clarity and we need firm arrangements to be made so that we can properly plan these hearings, so from our side and from the logical officer's side, we have serious problems and, for example, if Mr Mphahlele and/or the PAC indicate they will only be ready next week, how do we set up, it's no doubt possible to set up another hearing, but obviously at great inconvenience and expense, so I'm in your hands, I'd be grateful, and we actually, from the evidence, the Amnesty Department evidence leader's side, we actually implore the PAC, as we did in March when we met with the general secretary, we are here to assist the PAC in whatever problems they may have in getting the evidence to the hearing, but we ask them to come forward with proper submissions and proper evidence, that we can conclude these matters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a>	Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I think, from what I learnt last Friday at a meeting of the TRC and from what I have been informed since, that, inconvenient as it may be, we should give them one last chance, but perhaps you, Mr Prior, can make arrangements with Mr Mbandazaya, as to where he, if he can contact his client and we, if the PAC does not come in the next few days, we ignore them, but we go on with this one.  I don't know where we would have to sit.   Where are the applicants in custody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The present applicants are all at Fort Glamorgan in the East London area, so they are here, and I will make arrangements for the prison authorities to hold them here for the next at least week or so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I would suggest till the end of next week, say, rather than find we've made arrangements and then we find they've disappeared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I'll liaise with Correctional Services, I'm sure, they've accommodated us thus far, I'm sure that it won't be a problem.   Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If we are going to await, as we think we ought to, a general submission, I don't think it would be fair to ask any of the parties to make their addresses now, till they've heard what is included in that and been able to deal with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I agree, Mr Chairman, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We once again get to the stage that we adjourn this matter to a date to be arranged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think that we should also place on record our gratitude to Mr Mbandazaya for the sterling efforts he has made to bring about this submission of general propositions.   I think all of us who've had any dealings know how much he has tried himself in the last few weeks to achieve success in this regard, and if there's anything we can do to assist him in any way, he has only to approach us and we will do all we can, but I feel it would perhaps be better to leave matters in his hands than rather let people feel that he's acting on our behalf, but I leave the matter to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you suggest we do now, Mr Prior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, that concludes the evidence as far as I can take the Done Meyers and Mike Meyers matter.   We don't have anything scheduled for tomorrow, in the light of the adjournment of the Yellowwoods case, Mr Mthembu's case, we are then scheduled to commence on Wednesday.   Advocate Calitz said she was unable to be here before 11 o'clock, she will do her utmost to be here earlier, but asked for an indulgence that we start at 11:00 or soon thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I think that we should rather be here before and ask her for an indulgence that she sees to get her before 11:00.   I know that she has, I would hate to call it a problem, she has a young... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> A very young baby, yes, (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...a very young baby to look after, one she must be inordinately proud, because I think this is the... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> It's an amnesty baby, Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> First daughter, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> After four sons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, she... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So if you could make contact with her and tell her that we will meet her request if necessary, but we would prefer if she could get here a bit earlier and we start at ten o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes.   Mr Chairman, in addition thereto, I brought it to your attention earlier in chambers that in respect of the King William's Town golf club attack, Mr Ray Rade, the member of parliament for King William's Town, had contacted me last week and had indicated that he wished to make submissions under oath to the committee in that matter on Wed..., and he will be here on Wednesday morning.   So... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So we can start earlier with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And I've indicated that we'll be starting the hearing at nine o'clock, so to that extent we will start on time and Mr Van der Zi has indicated that his clients are aware of that date, he only has some problem with Mr Xundu, who seems to have been transferred around the country, but I'll leave that up to Mr Mbandazaya to sort out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, it is true, I confirm what has been said by Mr Prior.   My clients are around the two other clients because also their case was postponed to this week, but unfortunately Major Xundu is not around, I couldn't get him until this morning, and he told me that he was in Umtata, from PE to Umtata, transferred to Umtata, but he's back in PE and he's leaving on Wednesday for a course, he's writing exams in the morning, in the afternoon he's leaving for a course until the end of June, but in any event, Mr Chairman, I indicated to Mr Prior that we will proceed with the matter.   I've contacted, I'll keep in touch with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think the evidence we are likely to have is such that if it is recorded and he's allowed to see a copy of the record, he will be able to deal with it adequately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a>	Right, we'll adjourn till nine o'clock on Wednesday morning.</p>

<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a>MACHINE SWITCHED OFF</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> ...[inaudible] Advocate Collett's matter.  We anticipated hearing Mr Jimmy Jones' evidence, that is Mr Ntonga's client.  An affidavit was handed to me late last night and that has been distributed amongst the Committee.  Miss Collett has also received a copy.  However, Mr Ntonga indicated to me this morning that Mr Jones will not be attending this morning because his employer in Butterworth, that is the Butterworth Municipality was loathe to release him in the absence of an official notice or a subpoena.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a>	May I place on record at this stage that I had several weeks ago prepared a notice in terms of Section 19 of the Act and we had endeavoured to serve that subpoena on Mr Jones at Butterworth at his place of employment and unfortunately he was not there and no-one was prepared at the Municipality to receive it on his behalf.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a>	To cut a long story short, there seems to have been some difficulty in getting the subpoena to him and on that note he is not here and obviously there is nothing that I can do, other than try and serve a further subpoena upon him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is Mr Mbanjua coming here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Ntonga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ntonga, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, Mr Ntonga indicated to me that he was coming to the hearing this morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Shouldn't you wait and say this when he is here in case he has any explanation he wants to place on record or deal with in any way.  I think it is unfortunate that it should be done in two separate bits and I think we can deal with this when he has arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  May we then proceed with the King William's Town Golf Club and I ask Mr Radie to come up to the podium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mbandazayo, you are prepared to have this proceed today without the presence of the applicants I understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It will of course be recorded and you can consult with the applicants if anything should be said which you think requires further investigation.</p>

<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> It is correct, I am a member of Parliament.  I have been since 1987.

<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> Mr Chairperson, yes I do, I confirm the affidavit which I prepared and signed on the 11th of March in Cape Town before Mr Ntsebeza, the Chairman of the Amnesty Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was handed in as Exhibit E.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a>	Mr Radie, you subsequently contacted me and indicated that there were further matters or further information and further submissions that you wished to place before the Committee, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.  I felt that in the light of the allegations which were made in my absence by certain of the applicants relating to myself as being one of the targets of the attack, that I felt I should just amplify the affidavit before this Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Could you please proceed with your further submissions and amplification of your affidavit, Exhibit E, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> Thank you Advocate.  I do not want to take up unnecessary time of the Committee but I feel that the following remarks perhaps might assist the Committee to obtain a completely full picture in order to make a decision in this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a>	Mr Chairman, the King William's Town Golf Club is one of the oldest clubs in the country.  It was founded in 1892 and in 1992 we had a series of centenary celebrations.  I had been a member of the club since 1963 and also served for many years as a Committee member of the club and was very deeply bound up in the history of the club and totally committed to it.  	And it was for this reason that I decided in my capacity as a golf club member, to organise a tournament called the Masters, the King Masters Golf Tournament as one of the culminating celebrations that year in 1992 and we were allocated a date several months in advance namely the 28th of November 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a>	It was a non-racial tournament.  It went off extremely well and one of our own members of the club, Ivan Kwelani, if I remember correctly, won the first prize.  It was a totally non-racial event and I may just that King William's Town Golf Club was one of the very first clubs to open it's doors to all races in the 1980's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a>	It therefore came as a surprise that the attack which I understand was aimed at myself and at killing and maiming as many of those present as possible, actually took place at 10p.m. in the evening because the golf tournament had finished during daylight hours and the presentation had been completed by half past seven and most of the participants in that golf club tournament had already gone home.  That was in fact fortunate.  If an attack had occurred at 6 o'clock in the evening I'm afraid that there would have been even more severe damage to both life and limb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a>	The second aspect I just want to proceed to Mr Chairman, is the question of the amnesty itself, the applications of the applicants.  I have not had an opportunity personally to read the record up till now, so I haven't an exact replica of the record before me.  I'm relying on what I've read in the newspapers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a>	But the Committee in essence, as I've pointed out in my affidavit and as the Committee well knows, will have to determine whether there has been a full and complete disclosure on the part of the applicants.  Have they been entirely truthful?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a>	I have some doubts as to whether they have told the full story and I say that for a very good reason.  Naming me as the target at the time that they gave evidence before this Committee, frankly strikes me as strange and I honestly don't believe that I personally was the target that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a>	I believe this attack was planned by the APLA cadres, very well planned and planned in advance but I do believe that the possible intelligence which was available to them might have been somewhat less than accurate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a>	The Committee must examine the record of the criminal trial if it is possible to do so and endeavour to establish whether in fact at that time my name was mentioned as one of the targets and whether in fact the National Party was mentioned in the criminal case.  I've not had an opportunity to read that report either but I don't believe that my name was mentioned as a target during the whole of the criminal trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a>	Why then was my name mentioned?  As I've indicated to the Committee, I gave evidence by way of affidavit on the 11th of March and obviously that affidavit or a copy of it was made available to the applicant's legal counsel.  Having read that affidavit I would suggest that it provided the perfect hook upon which to hang a coat of political motivation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a>	Quite frankly Mr Chairperson and Members of the Committee, the callous attack that night was an unprovoked attack on innocent civilian people who had nothing to do with the golf tournament, certainly little to do with me.  I was attending only in my capacity as one of the members of the Wine Tasters Association of King William's Town.  It was an annual dinner and there was absolutely no reason for such a callous and cold blooded attack to take place on the unfortunate people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a>	For these reasons I would suggest that it is really  doubtful whether a full confession has been made.  If it has, whether in fact the applicants have been entirely truthful by raising my own name as a target in the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a>	One aspect which does really concern me is that in our Christian world we are faced with a situation where forgiveness comes after due confession and after repentance.  In this case it is doubtful whether there has been a completely full confession but even if that is so, there is absolutely no remorse and no repentance and this is one of the things that I find the most difficult to accept in the light of our constitution, in the light of our constitutions injunction about Ubuntu and reconciliation.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a>	And it must be one of the most difficult things for those friends of mine who suffered the loss of loved ones in the attack or suffered injury themselves, to accept that there is absolutely no remorse whatsoever on the part of the applicants.  Whether that in fact forms part of the criteria which the Committee has to weigh up in considering the application, is something which the Committee will have to decide and which the legislation may or may not provide for but that is a matter for the Amnesty Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a>	I think at this stage, that is about all I wish to say Mr Chairman, Members of the Committee and I'm quite willing to answer any questions that might be put.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Radie, just one question from my side.  Was your golf day postponed at any time because of bad weather?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> Mr Chairman, no, the date of the 28th of November was set several months prior to the tournament taking place and at no stage was there any postponement of this particular tournament.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a>MACHINE SWITCHED OFF</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a>	Mr Radie, I will start by saying that following up to your comments that you were a target of the attack.  Firstly I would like to say to you that there was never any criminal trial in this matter and I think if there was any you would have been a witness.  The criminal case is still pending.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> Thank you, I'm indebted to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Secondly, the question of you being the focus of the attack at the golf club, yes I want to consider that that was the evidence led in this, before this Committee and further evidence was that because you were a member of the National Party, according to the information those who were there were members of the supporters of the National Party and that members of the intelligence, security of the country will be there because you were there as a member of the ruling party.  But that one is for the Committee to decide.  That was the evidence led.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> May I reply to that?  Mr Chairman, as an ordinary member of the National Party at that time, and I was a back-bencher, certainly I was not privileged to have intelligence members or bodyguards or any support whatsoever.  I was completely regarded as an ordinary member of the public.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a>	Although I was a Member of Parliament obviously and had political inclinations, I certainly did not have any authoritarian support or cover whatsoever on that day.  There was, as far as I was concerned, no members of intelligence near the place nor were there any police on the premises.  We had to call the police after the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Thank you for that Mr Radie.  Would you agree with me to say that as a member of the National Party, definitely the people who are mostly in your company would be mostly supporters of your party although you are not autocratic, that it's necessary that all of them should be the members of the National Party or supporters of the National Party, would you agree with me that mostly it would be people who agree with your views?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> I would agree that there were some members of the National Party present who took part in the tournament but the tournament itself was participated in by members of other political persuasions.  And certainly there were no political speeches, there were no political flags flown, there was absolutely no indication in effect that it was in any way sponsored by the National Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a>	That does not exclude the possibility that there was political motive for the attack in the sense that it was decided to attack a soft target.  May I just mention Chair, that I do have a video recording of the news bulletin which took place on the evening after the attack and also a video recording of myself being interviewed on Agenda by Madam Collie Long, which I can make available, I have it with me, to the Committee for it's records.  I think that will probably amplify the situation, if the Committee wishes to use it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> If I might just ask at this point Mr Mbandazayo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a>	Is this the news bulletin where Bennie Alexander ...[indistinct] himself ...[indistinct]</p>

<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> That is ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MS GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a>	Would you Mr Radie, agree with me that the intelligence report is not always accurate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> Of course.  Quite frequently intelligence is not as accurate as it should be.  I serve on the Joint Committee on National Intelligence at the moment in Parliament and so I'm aware of these things.  You don't always get absolutely accurate information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Thank you.  And that is the reason why most of the time the raids of the South African Defence Force and the police were always killing so-called innocent people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> I think that's a very general question put to me and I have no specific knowledge of that particular suggestion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Let me quote a recent example</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a>"1993:  Attack in Umtata where school kids were killed in their sleep"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> I'm not qualified to comment on that particular attack but all I can say is that obviously it was a tragedy and it may well have been the result of inaccurate intelligence information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Would you agree with me that the confrontation, the confrontational politics in our country was a result of the policies of your party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> It was the result of the apartheid policy, of that I have no doubt.  And I may add that as far as my own personal situation was concerned, I entered politics in 1981 when I stood for the New Republic Party and defeated the National Party Candidate of the day in King William's Town, for the King William's Town constituency, for the Provincial Council and I crossed the floor to the National Party in 1985 after Mr P W Botha's: "adapt or die" speech, when the New Republic Party had folded up and when I decided to go into the National Party in order to work from within to rid it of the policy of apartheid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Would you also agree with me that inasmuch as you were in the, not in the National Party initially, whether in the DP or PFP or whatever the party, rather than National Party, you were there because you belonged to the privileged group in the country, that is the white community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> I was fortunate at the time to have been born white yes, and privileged certainly.  But I've certainly worked hard to make amends for that subsequently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> And also that even today you are still reaping the fruits of being that privileged, being in that privileged group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> Can I ask what you mean by; "reaping the fruits"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Like even your, you correct me if I'm wrong, that you had a business in King William's Town</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a>and the building you have leased to the Government and you are earning a lot out of that.  It far exceeds what you were getting whilst you were still running that business.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the relevance of this as to what took place at the golf club?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Chairman, what I'm getting at is that what happened on the day in question was the results of the policies of his party, that ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, that we dealt with.  You are now talking to him about his private earnings as a result of owning a business.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Chairman, I may have taken it from a different perspective.  Mr Chairman definitely, as a result of being in that privileged class at the expense of the other groupings in the country which also belonged to the country, he managed to be in that position.  That is what I'm trying to get at, as a result of the policies of his party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> I'm happy ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> In any event Mr Chairman, I ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> I'm happy to answer that question.  I certainly don't the business referred to which I presume is Radie ...[indistinct] Holdings, that you're talking about.  My shares were sold in 1985 in that regard so I have no interest there.  I have no interest in the legal profession any longer as I'm no longer a partner of Barnes and Ross in King William's Town.  And I'm just wondering if you are suggesting perhaps one of the reasons why the attack took place and I was a target was because I was one of the rich and privileged whites in the community.  Is that the suggestion on the part of the applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Well let me answer this way, is it correct that all the white people had a right to vote?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> Certainly, that was the position at the time, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> And you were put, the National Party was put into power by the white community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> And as such they agreed with your racist policies to subjugate that African people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> At the time yes, but things have changed considerably and the National Party took the decision under ex-President de Klerk, to do away completely with apartheid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MBANDAZAYO</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just one question Mr Radie, were there actually high ranking police officers of Security Force officers who may have been there as your guests on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> No, Sir, not to my knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I have been to King William's Town a few times.  I don't know the town but I presume like most towns of that size, you would at a function such as the wine tasting and as part of the centenary celebration, expect to find at it more the important people in the community that would of necessity mean perhaps the senior policeman, the senior army officers if there were any there, the doctors, the lawyers and people like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> Judge, yes, the Wine Tasting Association was mainly supported by a number of the Rotarians who are various leaders in their own field and members of the professions and so on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that is what one would expect because it wasn't aimed at any section of the community like that, it was merely that in a small town you find all the people who are running the town, at the functions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR RADIE:</span> Absolutely yes, I quite agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> There is nothing in re-examination, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Radie, for having come here today.  I'm sorry that the audience resembles the audiences that certain political parties used to get in the past but thank you yourself for having come here.</p>

<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, this matter, could this matter just stand adjourned because there is still the, there was an indication of submissions and maybe Mr Leklapa's evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh yes, we're still waiting to hear from him.  Have you got any further information, have you managed to achieve anything as yet or are we still hopeful?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Chairman, as of today I haven't managed to get anything Mr Chairman but I am trying my level best Mr Chairman.  I would request that it be adjourned for a date to be arranged and I'll communicate with the leader of evidence, Mr Prior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, we will do that because this potential witness is, I think we all agree, important not only in this case but to give a general picture of what the PAC and APLA policies were at the time.  He held a very responsible office and he could assist us and the applicants in many cases if he does come forward and give us an accurate picture of what the policy was and how it was applied.  So we will adjourn this matter to a date to be arranged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The applications of Zukile Mbambo and Dumisani Ncamazana was scheduled to proceed today.  Mr Chairman, for the following reasons the matter cannot proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, before you go on Mr Prior, may I place on record that the same four members of the Committee or sitting and can you and the applicants' attorney place yourself on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   Evidence Leader, Paddy Prior from Cape Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTONGA:</span> For Jimmy Jones or Njabane, B B Ntonga from Mdantsane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, we anticipate ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We also place on record that the attorney acting for the applicants in this matter is aware of the fact that it is being adjourned for reasons which appear later and she has been excused from attendance at this hearing.  She is fully aware of it and will given notice of when the matter recommences.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> That is Advocate Sally Collett from Bisho.  She has been fully appraised, in fact the message is for the applicants please to remain for a short while.  Her secretary will be attending them and taking further information, and giving them further instructions and information.  So she is fully aware of the proceedings to be adjourned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a>	Mr Chairman, firstly it was anticipated that we ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, before you go on, are those the two applicants sitting there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are they completely conversant with English?  If not, could they please be given headphones so they can understand what you are saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a>MACHINE SWITCHED OFF</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, may I just repeat that.  This matter of Mbambo and Ncamazana is to be adjourned.  Their advocate, Advocate Sally Collett from Bisho has been informed of the developments.  She is sending her secretary or a representative from her office to consult further with the applicants this morning and the request has been conveyed to the Correctional Services, that they remain in attendance until that business is completed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a>	The reason for the adjournment is as follows:  We anticipated hearing Mr Mbambo and Ncamazana's matter today and for how long it would take to finish the evidence.  We also anticipated hearing the evidence of Mr Xolile Njabane, also known as Jimmy Jones and when the hearing was also scheduled it was also anticipated that the PAC would be either sending someone to testify or making submissions. </p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a>	Mr Chairman, despite efforts on the part of our office to serve a subpoena on Mr Jimmy Jones, numerous attempts were made in Butterworth at his place of employment, unfortunately the subpoena wasn't served personally and no-one at the Municipal Offices was prepared to accept the subpoena on his behalf.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a>	Captain Els who assisted the TRC in the area, because there was other business to be attended to, was in telephonic contact with Mr Jones.  I'm informed by Captain Els that Mr Jones was not prepared at that stage to divulge his whereabouts but wanted to consult with his attorney before giving any further information to Captain Els.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a>	So the unfortunate upshot of all that was that Mr Jones wasn't served properly with a subpoena and I'm informed by Mr Ntonga this morning that his employer now refuses to release in the absence of a formal notice or subpoena from the TRC.  So it seems to be just confusion upon confusion which results in Mr Jones not being here, not being able to give evidence and not being able to be cross-examined.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand his employer is the Butterworth Municipality?</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, that is so Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I trust someone will inform them that their failure to release him this morning has rendered in probably thousands of rand being wasted in the costs incurred by these sittings and they could well have communicated with you or with the TRC offices in Cape Town to ascertain that he was legitimately required here.  And I think that their lack of co-operation is something to be deplored.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> We will certainly convey the Committee's sentiments to the Executive Secretary, Mr Coetzee, in Cape Town and request him that he takes up the matter at high level.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Ntonga is present and maybe he can add something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a>	Mr Chairman, may I just request, it's rather difficult to reschedule this hearing in the absence of any firm indication whether Mr Jimmy Jones will be available in the near future.  Certainly if he is able to be served a subpoena then that will be the end of the matter.  We will simply determine a date to reconvene and serve him properly with a notice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I find it difficult to understand how someone who works for the Butterworth Municipality cannot be properly served with a subpoena.  If his employers are so strict that they won't allow him to come to attend a hearing, they must surely be strict in ensuring that he is at work and if he is there he can be served.  So I think that is a matter that should also be taken up with them, that they can't treat the Committee as they appear to, the contempt they appear to do such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understood though that he did in fact consult his attorney yesterday and that an affidavit was drafted, so he is fully aware of the fact and was aware of the fact yesterday, that he is required to be here.  And now the only reason he is not here is because he says his employers won't let him be, which is a matter as I have already said, should be investigated with his employers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Ntonga is present and is in a better position or maybe in a position to shed some further light Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTONGA:</span> Mr Chairman, I did consult with him and pointed out this to him.  But as I've already indicated to the Leader of Evidence, is that he is still prepared as long as he can be served with a subpoena because his employers now are starting, are squealing about him coming over here.   Actually I had to go out of my way to go to Butterworth to try to get something going about this application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We're obliged to you for the assistance you have given us but it does seem the employers are not.  And in those circumstances it is obviously important that he should give evidence, that we will have to adjourn the matter to a date to be arranged because it may not only, as I have already indicated to Mr Prior, he must ascertain whether the averments set out in the affidavit are applicable or would have reference to not only the present two applicants but any other persons.  If they do, they must also be given notice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] be inquired into and we must ensure that when this matter is next set down for hearing, subpoenas have been served and notice has been given to all relevant parties.  And I would be obliged if you could explain to Mr Ncamazana(?) what would happen to him if a subpoena is served and he does not attend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We now ...[intervention]  If you would tell Mr Jimmy Jones what would happen to him after he has received a subpoena and he doesn't come here.  We therefore have to adjourn to a date to be arranged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Unless anybody has anything further to say or anything they wish to bring to our attention, we will now close this sitting.</p>
