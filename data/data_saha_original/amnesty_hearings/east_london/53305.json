May I read the affidavit by Mayapi as it is?\n\"I, the undersigned, Pumzile Mayapi, do hereby declare under oath that one, I am the deponent herein and the facts deposed to are, unless otherwise stated, within my personal knowledge both true and correct.  This is an application in terms of Section 18 of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995, and my reference number is AM 5247/97.  The application in question is in respect of the bombing of the Wild Coast Casino, in the district of Bizana on the 18th of April 1986, and the subsequent loss of lives and personal injuries.  I have been mandated by Ndibulele Ndzamela to depose on his behalf too.  He has also made an application under Section 18 of the abovementioned Act, and his reference number is AM 5051/97.\n\tBoth myself and Ndzamela were members of MK, the military wing of the African National Congress, and we both did the said bombing of the casino, acting within the ambit of the political objectives of the said African National Congress.\n\tMyself, Ndzamela and the late China, who was also an MK member, were deployed in the Eastern Pondoland region, under the command of the late Mzizi Bilo Makwageza.  And he is the person who had ordered the bombing of the Wild Coast Casino.  May I also mention that this order came after a senseless massacre of our people by the South African Defence enemy forces in Lesotho, in the beginning of 1986.\n\tI must also mention that we have been charged and convicted on two counts of murder and sabotage in respect of this matter.  We were similarly sentenced to death and that sentence was replaced with 18 years imprisonment on appeal, and we were subsequently released when there was a general amnesty which was granted to all political prisoners in February of 1990.\n\tI now wish to deal specifically with the bombing of the Wild Coast Casino.\nThe order from the command structure to bomb the Wild\n\tCoast Casino, came with the late China about a week before \n\tthe incident.  He also came with the two limpet mines that \n\twere to be used for the operation, or in the operation.\n\tThree days before the operation we did a reconnaissance of \n\tthe place in question.  On the day of the operation I \n\tborrowed a motor vehicle from a friend of mine, Mr \n\tKobungu.  We drove to Mzamba, that is the Wild Coast \n\tCasino.  It was myself, Ndzamela and the late China.  We \n\tcarried with ourselves the two limpet mines that were to be \n\tused in the operation and also had our pistols with us.  I, \n\ttogether with Ndzamela entered the casino, leaving China in \n\tthe car.  Ndzamela entered the gambling area first and \n\tplaced the big limpet mine underneath the sewerage pipe of \n\tthe toilet.  He came out and told me where he had placed \n\tthe mine and I entered and placed my limpet mine on top of \n\this.  The time was about 19H00, and it was estimated that \n\tthe mine would explode in about three hours time \n\tthereafter.  We then left the place for Nxingo(?) locality, \n\twhere we were staying.\n\tI submit with respect, that our actions abovementioned were committed with a political objective, and further, that there was no personal gain on our part.\n\tI further submit that we have made a full disclosure of the events that occurred on that day, as is required by the Act.  I also further submit that our actions abovementioned were committed before the cut-off date.\n\tNow to the families of the deceased and to all those who might have been affected and/or inconvenienced in one way or another by our actions, we sincerely apologise and ask for forgiveness.  We plead with them for their understanding.  I therefore pray that it may please this Honourable Amnesty Committee to grant this application.\"",

First of all I would like this Committee to know that this incident took place in 1986, at a time that I am sure that everyone knows that a conflict between the freedom fighters, or liberation movements and the government was at a high level.\n\tThis took place at a time when the movement that was leading the battle of the South African freedom fighters said South Africa should be rendered ungovernable.  That means that each and every institution that was seen as the ANC, as the extension of the oppressors in South Africa, that particular institution would automatically become a target.  These gambling casinos, all of them - or let me talk about this one in particular.  This was in the homeland of Transkei.  \n\tThis casino was an ivory tower that was so clear that this casino of Wild Coast, its presence in that particular place made it possible that there would be complaints from the people who were residing there, that that casino was there without any consultation with the people or community.\n\tSecondly, this casino was a place that was clear for one to see that it was there for people who would, during the battle in South Africa, who would ...(indistinct) for people to go there and relax, people who would go there and relax without knowing what was happening in this country.  Even the people who were employed there were the people who were working under the extreme oppression.  Even the few people who were offered jobs there were the people who were oppressed.
