There's no appearance on behalf of implicated persons.  There were substantial notice given to victims and there are several victims in attendance today, the names of which will later be furnished to the Committee.  There is no legal representation on behalf of victims at this stage. \n\tAs evidence leader I've explain the process to the victims present and they are happy to go along with the evidence leader representing them in a fashion, up to a certain point.  They would also require, as in the other applications, for the Committee to allow them an opportunity to ask questions and/or address the Committee at the relevant stage.\n\tMay I place myself on record for the Amnesty Committee Evidence Leader, P.C.

Given the large number of persons affected by this matter in King William's Town at the time and given the difficulty in tracing all the persons from records that were available, it was felt desirous to make publication in the local newspaper, the Daily Despatch, which I understand was arranged by Mr John Allen of the Media Departments of the TRC which had run an article about the King William's Town attack, the fact that the amnesty application be running this week, the 6th to the 9th of April.\n\tI unfortunately do not have a press clipping but one is available I understand at the East London office.  In addition thereto, the club captain was contacted at the King William's Town Golf Club and a general notice was pinned up on the notice board of the clubhouse two weeks ago, which set out in general terms that all persons having an interest in this particular matter had to contact the TRC as a matter of urgency.  \n\tI must say Mr Chairman, as a result of that several persons have contacted the Amnesty Committee to that extent.

The operation was as follows:  We were a unit of five operatives, Bheki was appointed as a commander and was carrying an AK47.  He was deployed outside the building within the hearing distance of comrade Vido.  Vido was deployed outside the building at the back and was armed with molotovs and an Uzzi submersion gun.  Myself and comrade Skumiso deployed inside, comrade Skumiso at the bar and myself at the party hall.  I was carrying an R4 assault rifle and on offensive M26 grenade and defensive M26, all reinforced.  Comrade Skumiso carrying an R5 rifle and same types of grenades and the drive, Togela Mkangwesa was at the car\"\n\tNow my first point will be, how was it possible - can you explain to the Committee, that as you have explained the organogram of APLA that there was a regional commander and comrade Skumiso according to you was a senior member and also you were senior, how was it possible that you were commanded on this operation by comrade Bheki?  And also that the driver of the car, comrade Togela Mkangwesa, can you explain how he was armed?  Can you take the Committee through that paragraph and explain the details of the operation as you brief them?",

        [
            "THEMBELANI TANDEKILE XUNDU",
            "Okay.  Let me rather take the Committee through in this format.  The way I drew up the operational plan was as follows:  There was a reconnaissance party and the commotion of the reconnaissance party was all the operatives although they were to go there in different timings and we had to consider the security of the operation or the security of the target, but every operative, all the operatives were part of the reconnaissance party.\n\tI have already indicated that they only became part of the reconnaissance party during final reconnaissance.  Then there was also a security part.  The security party were those people where there was also a command post, a command post, that means that was the commander for the operation had to be stationed, somebody who can be able to have a full view of whatever development is happening during the operation and be able to give commands.  \n\tThat composed of comrade Bheki, he was appointed commander, comrade Vido and the driver.  Then there was also lastly the execution party.  I think that is where you get it finally.  The execution party actually composed the most senior people, myself and comrade Skumiso.\n\tThe reason why we appointed or the reason why I think comrade Skumiso appointed comrade Bheki as the commander is that we were building our forces for leadership and the fact that, I think some 5 months thereafter, he was promoted from the position of being an ordinary force into an area commander.  It's quite indicative of the fact that we are right on track.  \n\tAnd simply because we had trust and confidence over the plan, operationally speaking and that each and every force understands the role that is going to be played by each and every operative in the operation.  And therefore, equipped with that knowledge, equipped with that information and coupled with the training that he had received from APLA, it was possible that given a change, he can command.  And the success or the failure of the operation, I think it proves me correct.\n\tSo if I may add, comrade Bheki was to command, as soon as we entered the gate he takes over the command and as soon as we go out of the gate I take over the command, went to the RV, as soon as we reached the RV comrade Skumiso takes over the command.

            "Okay.  According to the execution party, would be the people who enter the two entrances - if you have a picture of the golf club, under the command of comrade Bheki who was positioned in the security party and who was expected to give a signal for withdrawal at an appropriate time.\n\tAs soon as we get off the vehicle, went through the entrance of the golf club and as per the plan, comrade Lester went to the right, to the bar if I remember very well, I haven't been to the place since then, then myself to the party hall.\n\tThe plan was as follows and we adhered to it, that to first to catch the inning with the element of surprise, create confusion, we must first throw the grenades and I think I must have thrown the reinforce offensive grenade.  I'm saying reinforced because it is the way that, apart from its original form from the factories, we glued in quite many nails to reinforce the shrapnel effect so that it can cause much more damage.  \n\tSo it means that an offensive grenade, we could make if a defensive grenade in terms of the shrapnel effect and a defensive grenade, we could make it something more.  So I threw that grenade, waited for it to explode.  I made sure that I threw it in-between the -okay right in the passage, in the middle of the passage, so that it can injure or kill as many people as it possibly could.\n\tAfter that I fired some shots.  Now the reason I fired shots was, it was appreciated that if there is such a senior National Party member, Mr Radoo or Radu or whatever you call it, then it means there will be his VIP team, there will be senior police officers, senior army officers and national intelligence, the CIS and in fact right on that note, the information that we received from the man that I do not know, I cannot recall his name but he is the person I referred to earlier on as the person who was either the secretary or the person maintaining the club, but I understand he had an office there, he said, he described to us the way - it was historic, I mean that occasion, senior citizens would be there and he said in his own words: \"Learned people\" because he knew we were hungry for education,: \"Learned people, senior army officers, senior police officers\".\n\tSo we expected that some member of the security forces would be conscious enough, in light of the confusion that is made by the grenade, to respond or to fire back.   So I shot some, a few shots so that I can actually pin down that particular person.  I think comrade Lester did the very same thing on the other side and then the withdrawal signal as planned, then we withdraw. \n\tNow the manner in which we were going to withdraw was as follows:  The car, whilst the grenade is going off and some shots are being fired, was idling, moving very slow, prepared for moving at any time and as soon as we withdrew, the car moved very, very, slowly, idling.  The other comrades got into the car and then I was to be the first person, I mean the last person to get into the car so that I can cover the back because now we are facing the other side and the target was this side so we had to make sure that nobody comes out and gives us some problems whilst we are going away.\n\tAs soon as the car exceeded the, or passed the gate I got into the car and took over command as per the plan.  I don't know whether I've made myself very clear.",

            "Okay.  It is worth mentioning that in that point in time, 1992 November or let me say, right from June, that was the time marked by a high level of tension between the people and the security forces and that was at the height of the conflict brigadier Gqozo and the ANC.\n\tAnd subsequent the that the apartheid system reinforced Gqozo through providing him assistance, we noticed the deployment of the SADF and if I remember very well, they had three patrol bases, one right in town, one in Zwelitsha, one behind Xnesha which served, I mean which used to take some small detachment and do mobile patrols in Thembasa, Thembisa.\n\tSo given that heavy presence of the security forces, we had to get rid of the car as soon as possible.  But furthermore, when we took the car, we initially intended to drive it as far as Queenstown and just drop it near a police station with the key in because we knew that at the end of the day the owner was going to get it.  \n\tNow we drove off and as we drove off Thembasa right to King William's Town - brigadier Gqozo had what was it called? a peace force, a certain paramilitary click that wore a black uniform, if I remember very well, so as soon as we were on the national road we were noticed by these gentlemen.  And also there was another chap driving a Monza, it was part of the apartheid spies that was stationed or deployed in the Ciskei system, the chap was driving a Monza and he was staying in Thembisa.  \n\tHe spotted the car and I think I can confirm because he could provide a little bit of information to his bosses the SAP, so those chaps could not give us enough chance to do as we have planned.  In fact they tried to stop us, we couldn't stop and we were not armed so we had to drive very fast, get into one of the locations, I think it was Mzanzi location.\n\tThen we disappeared away from their scene and went back to Thembasa and then when we went back to Thembasa, ...[inaudible] so that he must assist us, I wanted him to drive the car and then we organised, we armed ourselves for any eventuality because it seemed that contact was inevitable at that time.  \n\tAnd we were not prepared to be caught, those were one of the principles we agreed upon as a unit, the ...[indistinct] detachment, so under those operational circumstances we went into the Alice line and we passed Alice there was a hastily prepared roadblock by the SAP.  \tI mean the - it was pretty obvious it was a roadblock hastily prepared for a specific reason and I mean, we were the guilty party but they let us pass through them, but as we passed they must have realised that okay, these are the people that we are looking for.  \tI mean the purpose of a hastily prepared roadblock, it's for a specific reason.  If the police want a certain vehicle, they have the registration, what, what, what, they would make it just a hastily prepared roadblock for that specific purpose, so it was very clear that they were after us, they tried to chase us.  \tWe went as far as Fort Beaufort and then on the way to Grahamstown we saw that they were closing up and there was a police station in front, I think it was Tamaga I don't know, but we decided no, there is no way you must dispose the car right here.  \n\tThen we went back with the Rover, back to Thembasa and we passed SAP right this way.

            "Yes, I can confirm what is in paragraph 27 because paragraph 27 puts into context the whole action carried out by ...[indistinct] detachment on the 28th of November 1992.   It just puts it clear that this was part of the national liberation struggle as seen by the PAC.\n\tAnd it further puts it clear that, if I may take  you back to certain historical factors, that peaceful means to wage a struggle have been exhausted by the African people for three centuries, the 17th, the 18th and the 19th century.  \n\tAnd after the 19th century, the African people were totally disarmed.  And if we remember, the last war of resistance must have 1912, and that in 1912 the oppressors continued to use violence against the African people who were using peaceful means to protest against the political system.  That is evidenced by the 1912 march by the women which was crushed violently by the security forces who were on horseback.\n\tThe mowing down of innocent Christians were led by Enock Nkijema in Queenstown.  The brutal crushing of the strike of the mineworkers in 1946.  It served to reason Mr Chairman, that violence against peaceful protest, African people was the standard practice of the security system.  And that violence against African people  undoubtedly had legacy.\n\tBut it was to intolerable levels in 1960 when our, 69 people were killed by the security forces.  It is worth mentioning that in the formation of the PAC in 1959, no provision by its leaders like Mangusuto Buthelezi was made for an armed revolution, it was never an option that our people could think of right from the beginning despite the facts that they have been killed from time to time, 1912, 1922 and you name the African wars of resistance.  \n\tThose, Sobukwe indicated that the political situation in our country was pregnant with untold possibilities but this possibility of ...[indistinct] an armed revolution was not in the line at the time.  Now the killing of our people or the time when our people were killed, I mean, it means the clouds of war were looming the horizon.  \n\tIn 1961 APLA was formed and APLA, you must understand that it was formed out of these objective conditions, out of a sheer demand for revolutionary violence against settler colonialists.  And for those people who always chose to beat the mountains out of the words settlers.  \n\tI refer to them as settlers because if we can visit history, history tells that some people outside the continent of Africa came here to colonialise our country but the colonialisation of our people, particularly in the occupied Azania, had a unique character from the rest of the African people.  It was not the same one which happened in Kenya, it was not the same one which happened Guinea ...[indistinct].  \n\tThe colonialists colonised Azania and then settled here, hence they are called settler colonialists or settlers.  So the words derived from history itself.  But the PAC have further chosen to give it a ...[indistinct] definition and said: even all those who worked for the perpetual existence of that evil system. \n\tAnd it is also worth mentioning that the white people in this country are very proud of being settlers and I think nobody, not even a professor can nullify that fact because the erection of the settlers monument which is still called settlers monuments in Grahamstown, is indicative of the way that they are attached, or they attach importance to them being settlers.\n\tAnd furthermore, the task of directing the armed action against the settlers was given to the revolutionary council in 1961 by the presidential council of the PAC.  That on its own is indicative of the nature of the violence that we had to direct to the white people, it was revolutionary violence.\n\tNow the golf club incident is no exception from that revolutionary violence.  And I want to put it to you Mr Chairman, that they members of Ekude detachment moved from those premises and that mandate given by the PAC.  \tAnd it is also worth mentioning lastly that in 1992 the PAC congress resolved to intensify the armed struggle and subsequently the commanders of the Azanian People's Liberation Army launched a campaign, Operation Great Storm.  And Operation Throw Stones, as the operation of the golf club was named, was an integral part of Operation Great Storm.\n\tSo we had the full mandate that was given to us by the PAC, given to us by the APLA command structures.",
