            "In 1987 before the national elections, I was working for the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry in Libode.  I asked for permission from my employer to go and help in the Voter Education in the Branch of Port St Johns where I come from.  I was involved in the activities of Voter Education, visiting different rural areas.  A rally on the 20th of April was organised.  I was fund-raising for that rally that was to take place.   We left the day before the rally to Majole, looking for a place where we were going to erect the tent and the other things.  We stayed there and looked for other things until the next day.  The following day, on this day of the rally, the 20th, we left from Majole with Mr Kanandyana's car, going to Port St Johns.  I was going there because I was sent to ask, to get the podium or platform and the loudspeaker.  When we got to town, next to the railway station, we met with Fundisele Guleni.  Fundisele Guleni talked to Mr Kanandyana at the railway station.  Before we could reach the town, he was with the other people of which were not known to me.   We turned back without getting into town.  Myself, Noteza, Fundisele and Mr Kanandyana went back in this car.  On our way, we were told that there were people who were suspected as APLA members who were on their way to disrupt the rally.  Myself and Noteza were at the back of the van, Fundisele as in front, occupying the front seat of the van.  We went towards Dumasi and the car was stopped, because there were people hitch-hiking.",

            "We went to a place called Dumasi and there was a big board (indistinct) bungalows, that is where the people were picked up who were hitch-hiking next to the road.  We left that place, we went towards Etombo.  We got next to a place called Mfhadla and the car took a turn.  Myself and Noteza were at the back of the bakkie and Fundisele and Mr Kanandyana were in the front in this bakkie.  The car took another direction towards Majola, but another route to Majola, not the one that was known to me.  We joined this Majola route on the other side.  We went to the rally and we got in, there were people there and I think even the General was there at the time.   The car got in the field and took a turn and we went to stop the car on the other side of the ground.  Mula left us in the car, myself and Noteza.  I am not sure where Mr Kanandyana was at the time, but I am sure that myself and Noteza and these people who were hitch-hiking, these people who had been given a lift, were in the car.  When Mula came, he came with Mzwandile.  We were told to get into Mzwandile's car with those people and there was Mqiza.  Mqiza was coming from Majola and I had seen him the day before this rally, on the 19th.  We were taken to a certain house that I did not know, I got to know later, that that was Mqiza's home.  I did not know that that was Mqiza's home, but I got that information later.  I am forgetting something, before getting to Mqiza's home, of which I will apologise, because I am not sure about this one, I am not sure and I cannot remember where did Mzwandile give us the firearms, but I remember that he gave me a pumpgun and when we got to Mqiza's home, I pointed them with this pumpgun and Mula had a firearm that looked more like a 5mm.   Their bags were searched, they wanted to know what was in their bags.  When we moved there, we were told to get into Mzwandile's car by Mzwandile.  We took another route to a place that I was seeing for the very first time, and I was told that that was the route getting to Buche.   When we got there, they also alighted from the vehicle.  Next to the road, there was a tree, a thorn tree.  Just a distance like from this table to that place, to that other table, there was this thorn tree and these people were standing on the other side, and they were questioned, wanting to know who were they and where were they coming from.  There was this misunderstanding, because the others, the other one was telling them not to answer, to give the others a chance to answer.  That is when Mzwandile decided to divide these people into two groups.  These people were on the other part of the slope, the slope was deep, they were on the  high point of the steep and Mula went to the other side and questioned the other group and Mzwandile was questioning the other group.  As we were still listening to that, I heard a gunshot from behind.  I was very shocked because I only remembered afterwards as when I thought about the people who were at the back, because there was nothing that could lead to a fight or conflict, because no one was assaulted at the time.  I got a shock when I heard this gunshot.  After this, Fundisele and Mzwandile were talking and when I listened, to me it looked like Mzwandile was saying he thought he got a signal from Mqiza to fire.  I cannot say for sure today here, what Mzwandile was saying because he said something like - he made a signal and Mqiza misinterpreted that and he shot the people.  Within no time, those people were taken in the car and when Fundisele told Mzwandile to take those people to the hospital, I was also there.  Mzwandile was driving, there was Fundisele and I was also in the car.  There was a misunderstanding, when they were talking about taking the people to the hospital.  I also want to explain the fact that after that shooting, when Mqiza fired,  I couldn't understand a thing thereafter, and I didn't even know.  I couldn't even ascertain whether this was the intention or not, but because those were the people who knew each other and they were just involved in this misunderstanding.  There was this verbal conflict.  I am sure that Mzwandile did not say let us take a turn here, but I am sure that he turned the car, he took a turn and we went passed the scene.  We went to the other side and turned there and stopped the car.  That is where these people were removed from the car.   But while I was in the car, I realised that some people were injured, but I did not see that on the way from Buche to Gomolo, because I was in the front seat of the car, and later I realised that there were people injured there, though I was not sure about the extent of the injuries.  I wanted to get Mzwandile and hear what he was saying, because Mzwandile, just after the shooting, after these people were removed from this car, he issued instructions and he said that no one was going to escape that situation, and no one would go out and tell the other people about it.  If ever anyone would do that and go out and tell people about that incident, he knows very well what was going to happen to him.  These people were again divided into two and the people who were injured, were put on the other side of the bushveld and they were taken to the other side, and those who were not injured, were on the other side, Mzwandile's side to the group where I was in.  He said \"Mqiza finish up what you have started with a knife, because the firearm was going to make a noise and alert the people from the village\", because it was during the day.  I think that he mentioned that three times or four times, saying that those people should be finished.    No one was doing anything.  Mqiza came with a knife, I am not sure whether this knife was with him or he took it from the other person, but he couldn't do what he was supposed to do.  I am not sure whether he tried or not, but he couldn't finish off what he was supposed to do.  After that, Mzwandile from time to time, would leave and leave us guarding these people up to such time when it was decided that these people were still alive, be taken to another place to be finished off.  That is what was said by Mzwandile in my presence.  We left with these people, four of them if I am not mistaken, we took them and we went towards Nzimbeni, we went passed Qwele.  Mzwandile took a turn there, there was drizzle or light showers and the car stopped there and Mzwandile instructed Mqiza to finish off, that is when these people who were still alive, were shot at the time.  Because of my situation at the time, I couldn't even see how this happened, and actually I feel better today, because at that time, I didn't even know that I would be in that kind of place and I never even thought or anticipated that would happen, but it happened anyway.  We were taken into the van.",

            "After Mqiza shot these people, we were told to put them in Mzwandile's van, at the back and Mzwandile said there were tools in his house.  I cannot remember whether we went to inspect the others that were left on the other side, or we went straight to Mzwandile's place.  I think we went to those other people who were injured before, and when we got there, they were not there.  We went into this place that looked more like a rivulet and it was impossible for us to get some torch or something to light the place and see what was happening.  Mzwandile told us that we would go to his place and get the spades.  He went to Mrs (indistinct) house, to the backyard, a house in that backyard, and he got the spades.  We went out and when we got there, he stopped a car somewhere and he looked around, and he pointed a place where we were supposed to dig.  The marshals dug, I was not involved in the digging, but it is not because I couldn't dig, but the way I was so frightened that day, I don't think I would be able to do anything.   I went to stand behind Mzwandile, he had this big firearm, Mzwandile that is.  I think it was a G3.  As we were there in this small piece of land, he was also moving around.  I also had this pumpgun with me.  I was looking around, trying to see if there wasn't any person coming to disturb.  After that, those people were buried in that hole.  The spades were taken to the car and Mzwandile took us to our places of residence.   I requested to start with me, to go and drop me home, but he decided that I would be the last person to be dropped home, he did so and he took me back home.  That is so.",

I would like also to point the Committee to page 48 in support of my application, page 48 of the Bundle wherein there is a statement by Mr Guleni, paragraph 37, that is the relevant paragraph, when he says when they left, there was a general assumption that these people were to be taken to hospital, but Mzwandile said if they did that, they would be arrested.  That is in support of my application.   I also would like to refer the Committee to the statement by Mr Guleni where he says on page 47, 48, there are two paragraphs 34 there, and then there is also paragraph 35.  It is clear from those three paragraphs, the two paragraphs 34 and paragraph 35 that these APLA people were disillusioned members, it is clear that after the interrogation, it is clear that these people were disillusioned, they were trained, they were to an extent abandoned by APLA, the PAC, they were being integrated into the TDF.  They are not happy with the integration into the TDF, they are clashing with their own comrades, with their own APLA comrades.  They are now leaving the base where they are being integrated, to go to Umtata, to go to Qogani.  This is on the version of the applicants.  Why then would people, who are in such a position, be seen to be posing a threat of a counter-attack, of a revenge attack?  It is my submission to the Committee that this purported attack is not reasonable and cannot be accepted.  I am sure even the applicants do not bona fide believe this now or even then, that there was to be a counter-attack.   A second point, my instructions are that the applicants have not made a full disclosure.   The affidavit of Mzwandile is in complete contrast to both the testimony of the applicants.  Mzwandile is saying that Mr Guleni played an active role, he is the person who was giving the orders.  The statement by Mzwandile, it is from page 84 to page 90.  It is  my submission that on reading that statement by Mzwandile Jagu and on reading the statement by Mr Gasmeni, the survivor of the attack, that would be on page 101 to page 109, those statements are similar in material respects, that these people were lined up, an order was issued that they be shot and these people were shot.  Gasmeni is not providing the names, because clearly these people were unknown to him at the time, who gave the order and everything, but Jagu supplies us with the names, that so and so gave the order, so and so did this, so and so did that.   It is my submission that the two applicants did not make a full disclosure with regard to their role in the actual murders.  I am now saying if the Committee on the first submission I make, there is no political objective, does not agree with my submission, dismiss that and says there is a political objective, the second point to be considered by the Committee is, did these people make a full disclosure.  It is my submission that they have not.",

Of course there are other charges, possession of unlicensed firearm because he says they were carrying Uzzis, pump action guns and the like, I believe they had those for political objectives.  The abduction of the APLA cadres earlier on during the day, I believe based on the Act, that abduction was justified.

            "With regard to the application by Mr Guleni, relating to the murder of Mr Mapipa, ,from his testimony proffered, we do ascertain, he so also admits, that at the time Mr Mapipa was murdered, he had never been involved in any endeavours, interfering with the election campaign of the ANC.  He was never involved in any of the alleged political clashes in Port St Johns, specifically the time that he was so shot at and murdered, he was not engaged in any activities attacking the applicant and therefore there could not have been any political reason why the applicant would hold Mr Mapipa a political target.   That at least we are so sure of from the testimony of the applicant.  What could be arguable though itself, I will show it to be baseless, is that the unit alleged by Mzwandile Jagu, to be in Mr Mapipa's motor vehicle was a Third Force Unit or APLA, either way, that also does not ground a reason for the murder of Mr Mapipa and therefore there could not have been any political objectives sought to be achieved in taking the life of Mr Mapipa.   As contended by the victims through me, even those who were with Mr Mapipa, were not APLA members.  That they were not, could not also be refuted by the applicant.  His Lordship seems to argue that at the time the act was committed, the applicant bona fide believed that what he was shooting at, put aside the question of Mr Mapipa, was APLA, but His Lordship would agree with me that determining or ascertaining one's bona fide beliefs, such determination is arrived at objectively.  In other words, objective facts should exist upon which that genuine or bona fide belief is based.   There being no objectively ascertainable facts upon which the applicant could have genuinely believed that the boys who were with Mr Mapipa, were APLA members or Third Force Unit as having been reported to him by Mzwandile.  That not being the case, his state of mind at the time that the offence was committed, cannot be said it shows a genuine belief on his part.  Even if one focuses on the alleged Third Force Unit or APLA men who were attendants or guards to Mr Mapipa, for whatever reason that could possibly have been, but the fact of the matter is that on mere report by Mzwandile that Mapipa' van with a Third Force Unit or APLA Unit, they jumped into the van and attacked.  Unless the applicant did ascertain the identity and the capacities of those who were in the motor vehicle with Mr Mapipa, he have never done so, it just cannot by any stretch of imagination, be argued, from whatever angle, that he had risen to believe that those were APLA members, not particularly a trained member of a military wing of a liberation organisation, and my submission conclusively is that the murder of Mr Mapipa as an individual, there was no political reason, no motive on the part of the applicant.  In the same way as it is an afterthought, just a concocted story that those who were at Mr Mapipa's motor vehicle, were a Third Force Unit.  We do have in the Bundle of documents, a statement by Mzwandile Jagu.  Even though that statement relates to the five fellows that were picked up on the road and murdered, that statement as to who Mzwandile is, tells this Committee that certainly the allegation by the applicant that he was a man from whom commands could emanate, are merely a (indistinct) on the part of the applicant, to portray a situation wherein commands and instructions were given to him.   In the same way as there was no reason for applicant to believe as he seeks this Committee to believe, there was no reason at the time Mzwandile was reporting to him about this Unit, there was no reason for him having a trained mind, in a military action or (indistinct) situation, there was no reason for him not to assess and seek to ascertain the veracity of the statements by Mzwandile and the conclusion one is led to arrive at, is that it is a mere fabrication that Mzwandile make that report.   If one looks at the statement, on page 89, that would be paragraph 2.  I do understand His Lordship, that he has indicated that he did not read through the statement, but if His Lordship would, he would read that what Mzwandile says is that\n\"...  my bakkie was washed the blood in the garage, and the time by then, was about ten.  I left them in town after a strong warning that if I can ever reveal or if I can reveal all this thing, my property, myself and my wife, would be destroyed.  Even if I can go to hide myself, they will hunt me.\"\n\tMy Lord, there is no reason why this Committee would doubt that extract or portion of the statement by Mzwandile, and this Mzwandile is the very same Mzwandile whose bakkie was used when Mr Mapipa was murdered, and my submission therefore is indeed, there was no political objective sought to be fulfilled by the applicant.

The political leadership and the organisation, both in the ANC, the PAC and AZAPO, (indistinct) may name them, all in the left, certainly they decry any political acts by anyone of their members directed to a member of another political organisation in the order that you shall find in the left of the centre in the South African political scheme of things and my submission therefore is even if we take Mr Mapipa as having been a Robben Islander, a member of the PAC, taking his life does not fit in in the political objectives any individual involved in the political struggle may seek to achieve.  Eliminating Mapipa would not advance any political interest in effecting change in this country.

            "Just a few Chairperson.   Chairperson, I have listened carefully to the submissions that have been made by those appearing for the victims.   I would like Chairperson, just to make a few comments.  In particular sir,  that when the Committee determines this application, it is important that the context within which these acts happened, must be taken into account.   I am saying so because Chairperson, the provisions of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act particularly Section 20(3) sets out the criteria that must be taken into account in determining as to whether an act is an act associated with a political objective.     Amongst those criteria the political motive is supposed to be taken into account as well as the context within which the acts took place.  It may well be argued that the ANC decried violence against other political organisations within the land, but the matter does not end there because if you look into the political motive, one cannot negate the fact that these actions were politically motivated.   It is common cause Chairperson, that in particular regarding to the APLA 5, that they were members of APLA, they were trained as such.  It is common cause as well that during that period, there\nwas a conflict, a fierce conflict between the ANC, SDU's and the PAC in the form of APLA.  In a way that is almost common cause in this house.  It is unfortunate that those conflicts resulted in this particular actions.  I have taken into account as well Chair, the submission which was made that the decision to kill the APLA 5, was prompted by a desire to evade prosecution and nothing else, but there is an alternative explanation that has been tendered by the applicants to the effect that not only that, whilst they concede that it may be well be that they did not want to be prosecuted, but as well, they did anticipate that should they release them, there was anticipated a counter-attack onto them.  Even if, for that matter, Chairperson, it can be argued that amongst the reasons, they were avoiding prosecution, given those times, prosecution itself to a great extent, would hinder their political objective if they were to be prosecuted at that time, given their role in the area, particularly Guleni because he was a leader there.  If he were to be arrested, that to a certain extent would hinder the political process of their own organisation.  In a way Chairperson, I would certainly argue that it is very difficult to say these particular actions were not politically motivated.  Regarding Mr Mapipa, it is also accepted that he was a prominent member of the PAC in that area and there was this conflict that was there.  In a way, as well ...",
