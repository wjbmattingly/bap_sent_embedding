Now the execution is then given in broad guidelines.  It would be aligned with phase 2.\n\tThen a further climate establishment or creation, especially among the whites in the corridor.  And then the third paragraph is then the development of the area, that is Ciskei/Transkei in the corridor as the fatherland or the motherland of the Xhosa.  You can understand why there must be a creation of a climate because that the corridor becomes part of the Xhosa land.  That is from East London up to Queenstown.  That is a corridor that is part between the Ciskei and the Transkei and that is then the Xhosaland with one nation, one country.  \tNow this Xhosaland would then also, would then establish the land claims, the embarrassing land claims.  \n\tThen paragraph 4:  The current three areas.   It went economically very difficult.  And then also with East London as a free harbour they would have the power to be much stronger and the RSA then had to assist them with this, with financial assistance.\n\tParagraph 5:  Xhosaland is then a success, presented as a success and the envisaged Xhosaland can become an African power.  And I realise it must have been perhaps a bit ambitious to put it in such a way and that could have perhaps led to international recognition.\n\tIn paragraph 6:  As an example we also thought that King William's Town with Bisho next to it would be the logical choice to incorporate first and the rest of the area would then follow.  In those years there were industrial growth points and Berlin in this area was one of them and we thought that that should be stimulated further as a growth point.\n\tParagraph 7:  There was also urbanisation and we thought that this plan would then arrest urbanisation in this area.\n\tParagraph 8:  Xhosa election with participation of whites should be held in order to establish the first fully representative parliament.  I think I mentioned yesterday that a group of us were not in favour of this, the whole idea of a three-chamber parliament, and the idea was that on regional level we would establish a four-chamber parliament and the State would then have to function.

Phase 3, that is the corridor is then frozen for later possible application and it then makes provision for white reaction, negative reaction against the incorporation of the corridor into Xhosaland and this further implies that such incorporation shall occur only when the population is ready therefore.  One isn't quite sure when this would be ready, but as soon as it is then the incorporation can proceed and then also prevent that this aspect places our government in an embarrassing position with voters.

Now it occurs in two successive phases, it's for a year up to June '87.  Phase one is the XWB, also as referred to in the first course of action.  Now the aim here is to establish a confederation of States in the Eastern Cape before June '87.  Now this refers back to Plan Strelitzia.\n\tPerhaps I can just explain here.  With Plan Strelitzia the idea was an independent Ciskei/Transkei with the Eastern Cape, Region D.  That would not be this whole confederation of States in an alliance.  Now the Eastern Cape would have been a province.  \n\tNow the execution thereof, that's on page 85, that would have been based on the KwaNatal concept, that is joining Eastern Cape and Ciskei/Transkei in a confederation.  There should have been influencing actions.  The Eastern Cape then acquires provincial status and second-tier government.  That would have put it in position to become a fully fledged member of this confederation.\n\tIn paragraph 4:  Lennox Sebe and his supporters then are removed from the political scene, they were not in support of this plan.  The same as phase 2.  \n\tAnd then in paragraph 5:  Lent Makoma and his party colleagues could then replace Lennox Sebe.\n\tAnd in paragraph 6:  There is a word \"Xhoscape\", Xhosa Cape Confederation is then established and that is then followed up by treaties and agreements for cooperation.",

            "There were different variations, once again because it was a broad idea.  So there were many ideas that could come into play with these different courses of action.  It can be noted that the first phases are the same.  That is then the liberation of Charles, the establishment of the resistance movement, getting rid of Lennox Sebe.  That's part of the first phase.  This also underlines the importance of a strong pro-RSA XWB in the Eastern Cape as a prerequisite for permanent stability and normality.  That is the counter-revolutionary front idea.\n\t13:  And with this plan a condition of permanent normality in the Eastern Cape can be attained.  Now the existing plans are good but it can't guarantee it and therefore this plan is also an extension of this.\n\tThen paragraph 14:  Lennox Sebe is an embarrassment for the government.  The SP, that's the State President, said it himself, and with the implementation of this plan he will be got rid of.  Now this action is not linked to a specific phase or plan, it could happen now.  That was now before this plan was approved or put into action and it can just facilitate the execution of this or similar kinds of plans.\n\tThen 15:  The proposed unification of Ciskei and Transkei is possibly the best logical means to satisfy the aspiration of the Xhosas.  One could perhaps just say that all the different aspirations expressed for Xhosa unity was emotionally loaded.  In the unstable instable(?) that we had in the Eastern Cape the fear we had was that there would be execution of Xhosa unity done without proper thinking and it would lead to further instability, so this had to do with ordering the situation.\n\tNow the feeling in the Eastern Cape was that Xhosa unity had to come.  The question was just how it should come into being and when.  And then the incorporation of the corridor in Xhosaland with upset the whites in the area, especially the right-wing people may try to get some gains out of this.  But there is a common factor which would make this more acceptable for people, and that would of course be the great economic growth that would be possible and the government must be prepared to pay for this incorporation.\n\tParagraph 17:  A formidable Xhosa ally would be positive for the RSA and this could then be used to keep the people contained and together Xhosaland can also then fight against this onslaught.   And from a military idea that was the aim, that was in the counter-revolutionary war.",

He enjoyed a lot of status, especially among the Security Forces, that's the police and the army of both countries.  He had the background, the ability, the personality, the stature, to activate and lead the XWB, but he was someone that you had to control - I don't know what the Afrikaans word is, he was a maverick.  And we felt that we had to strictly control him in order to let this plan proceed orderly.\n\tThen page 88.  He projects traditional authority and it can then be expected that the Security Forces and the older generation will support him.  Opposition from the left and the youth and also from Lennox could be expected, but that kind of opposition must be wisely turned around.\n\tParagraph 7:  Should Charles for any reason not be able to lead the XWB, then we would have to look at other leaders such as Brigadier Holomisa and Major Sandile who were part of the Transkei Army as other candidates for the leadership role.\n\tAnd D:  Charles' physical and psychological health condition must be strengthened after he had been freed.",

And then accommodation facilities should be made available, capital must be provided.\n\tAnd then page 89:  Covert Xhosa-speaking troops.  Now with troops it is meant people who had already received training as constables or soldiers so that you don't have to start with training right from the start.  They should be appointed to the XWB so that this movement could have teeth with visible power.  The XWB would then operate under the cover of a front organisation as a counter-revolutionary movement.\n\tAnd then just the conclusion.  The course of action or variations is then the cardinal idea to fight the revolution in the Eastern Cape.  2 and 3 are watered-down models and would not have the same effect as action 1. \n\tAnd then in 21 I ask for approval in principle for action 1 or then alternatively for courses 2 and 3.

I will work through them.  Now the first difference is the date is 9 July, approximately a month later, after the plan was presented in Pretoria.\n\tNow this plan does have annexures that the other plan did not contain.  Now here you will see that we here refer to Operation Katzen.  That is why there is OP given there, it's Operation and it had a name, Katzen.  We referred to it yesterday.  Paragraph 1 and 2 on 113 is new.  That gives an introduction and it refers to the order that we received from the State President - that is in paragraph 1 - that the situation had to be normalised by December, not only in the Eastern Cape but in the whole country.  I yesterday already said that it was an impossible time-frame, so it imply that the situation had to be stabilised by the end of October, which is even more impossible for us because the stabilisation bases that we had to create had come into operation.\n\tNow 2 is also new and it is very clear that the current unrest situation cannot be normalised against the background of the state of emergency.

And in 6, it should not be traced back to the RSA because of the sensitive political nature and also concerning the whites and their reactions.\n\t7 to 10 is also new.  That is the Xhosa aspiration for unity.  It's not new, it's also in 1.  Traditional leaders must be used maximally.  The present Ciskei Government must be replaced with a pro-RSA government.  Perhaps I should just add, because of the friction between the RSA and the Ciskei Government at that time, this Ciskei was not seen really as anti-RSA but they weren't pro, so this perception was strengthened by what Lennox Sebe said during his public statements that he made.\n\tParagraph 10:  Elements of the execution of the plan did not have to be dependant on one another.  \n\t11:  And then the scope.  That's also new except for the first sentence that is the resistance movements.  Then you have four phases and the first plan only had three phases.  And then the different phases are then given in terms of priority and they could also be done independently.\n\tThen page 116, that's the same.  Also 117, nothing new there.  118, there are a few aspects where there are differences.  On 118 you will see that it only says method.  It's not only an idea, the plan has been strengthened, it's not necessary to give different courses of action.  The method or the course of action given here with the four phases now contain what I expressed on 1, with three courses of action.  So it's now proceeding more in the direction of a plan, whereas the first one was more an idea.  \n\tAnd then the execution is done in four phases.  That is up to the date of December '87.  Now phase 1, it's difficult to say exactly which phase is new but I would say that phase 1 would be the newest of those included, and the aim is to stabilise the Eastern Cape and the Ciskei, November '86.  That's on the security terrain.  \n\tAnd then the execution ...(indistinct) of a climate at Namba Sebe and then also the establishment of the XWB and then the Transkei leader's acceptance thereof.  Now that at that stage had already been in existence, it had been achieved.\n\tParagraph 2 on that page, the establishment of the XWB and the expansion thereof.  And then also the Ciskei People's Rights Protection Party had to be extended and then also involving smaller moderate groups.  And then 4, climate creation for the Xhosa nation with all the different groups, Transkei, Ciskei and Eastern Cape.  And 5, the liberation of the Sebe group.  I think it was two of his sons, two children. \tChairperson, I can't remember but I think Namba Sebe's son was also involved, and then the appointment of Charles Sebe as leader of the XWB.\n\tParagraph 6:  Then the training and organisation of smaller moderate groups for the take-over of third-tier authorities.  Those are the local authorities.\n\tAnd then 7:  The coup d'etat.  I don't think that appeared as a concept in the first plan, where Lennox Sebe is then replaced by moderate people, pro-RSA such as Lent Makoma, Namba Sebe and Charles Sebe.\n8 is the same, that is the security alliance.\n\tChairperson, I'm going to continue with the differences, is that in order?  Then phase 2, the aim was to establish an Eastern Cape confederation of States before January '87.  That refers back to Strelitzia.  There's nothing new there.  Also not on page 120, also not on page 121, 122 also not, 123 also not.  Then the implications on 123, the same, 124 is the same, 125, 126.  127, there is a small technical difference.  In paragraph 22(a) I said the XWB headquarters would probably be in Port Elizabeth and here we say that it should be in the Transkei area.  128 is also the same, I also ask for approval in principle and I also signed it.",

It is not as tight, one can put it that way, as would be applied in a court case.\n\tWe, the panel have discussed this matter during the adjournment and we are of the view that it would be improper to allow the questions to be asked and make such a ruling, the ruling being that we will not allow it.  To do so would in our view, lead to various potential difficulties.  For instance if we did make the ruling that the questions of this completely irrelevant to this application, evidence be led, such evidence would then become part of the evidence of this particular application, which might, depending on the answers given or the answers not given or refused to be given, have an effect on whether or not the criteria of full disclosure has been made.\n\tIf there is not a full disclosure in respect to a piece of evidence that is completely irrelevant, but which is ruled can be pursued, how does that effect non-disclosure in this application, that sort of problem.\n\tWe also believe that this questioning would not really have the effect of shortening proceedings because the time taken in this, the questioning in this application, would be the same time, presumably that would be taken if the evidence were to be led, where it ought to be led at the application of Mr Jansen's client.\n\tIn the circumstances, we are of the view that seeing that the evidence is completely irrelevant to this application, that we will not allow the questions to be put.

You then come up with Plan Katzen, which has a thread running between it and Strelitzia, although there is differences, there are similarities.\n\tCorrect me if I am wrong, but I get the feeling that that Plan Katzen was drawn up as a reaction to a situation that you had been placed in, in other words come up with a plan to stabilise this area or normalise it, so you just improve on or amend slightly Strelitzia and resubmit it.  Did you in your heart of hearts believe that Plan Katzen was a Plan that could succeed, if not within that 18 months in which you were given to normalise the area and I think you had mentioned that you thought it was optimistic, do you think it could have succeeded at all?",

One can read of this desperate factors if you read Plan Katzen and even Strelitzia.\n\tBesides the very short time frames that we had, it is also true that the situation in the Eastern Cape reached peaks of being out of control, or not being controlled.  No, I did not think that Katzen could stabilise or normalise the whole situation.  In Katzen, I also wrote that this does not replace our existing plans and we had plans on a variety of terrains.\n\tKatzen was seen as, I won't say as a desperate effort, but as being a more drastic way to see whether we couldn't perhaps in that time frame, start to address this one big problem in the Eastern Cape.\n\tThe idea was that it should commence, make a start and then by means of good control, keep things on track and then through that, that we could address this one main problem, existing in the Eastern Cape.\n\tBut to put it in this way, I did not really put all my hope on Katzen.",
