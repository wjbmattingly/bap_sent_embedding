I would like to read the following to you\n\"With reference to this second application, we would like to confirm that the past few days, we have consulted with our client, and he has considered his position.  After deliberation with the Advocate and had regard for the applicable documents, we came to the conclusion that our client is not guilty of any misconduct and was not guilty of gross human rights' abuse and the application would be futile, because the subject thereof is not applicable to amnesty and we would be guilty of wasting your time and the State's funds if we should continue with the application, and therefore the application is withdrawn.  We apologise that this decision was finalised over the weekend, but we had to prepare ourselves properly and we will attend the meetings.\"\n\tMr Chairman, I don't have a mandate to furnish you with the same regarding Mr Clive Brink, but I have indicated to Mr Mapoma, that I will get in contact with his Attorney before the end of the day to enable you to make a decision on that as well.

It did cause certain problems because all these weapons had been sealed, to be watertight and we had to remove the vehicle from which we retrieved it and break the seals and that meant that we could be spotted by the Police or the public.  I understood later from Nieuwoudt that these four AK47 rifles, magazines and handgrenades had been given to four of his agents who would take it to Umtata.  These four agents were actively involved, according to him, and they were kept as a sort of a surprise for whichever purpose he required.  Whether they were there as contingency agents should something go wrong, or whether he had something else in mind for them, is unknown to me.  Later that day, after the delivery of the arms, we heard by means of news reports that the coup d'etat had not been successful, and that Colonel Duli and various other members of the group who had participated, had been killed during this attempted coup.",

While they were in possession of legal ID documents from the Transkei Armed Forces, they were charged and found guilty, but later they were released.  The ANC and the PAC after this availability of the Transkei, continued with their attacks especially on vehicles which were used by whites or which were driven by whites.  There were various incidents during which whites in transit on the roads in Transkei, were attacked and wounded.  There was also a base at Sterkspruit where six PAC members had established themselves in the town itself.  There was also a PAC base, approximately a kilometre from the Aliwal North/Transkei border.
