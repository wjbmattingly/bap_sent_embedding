            "Mr Maseko, just two or maybe three last points - in my dealings with other APLA applications and particularly where there was a repossession or a commandeering of property before an attack or an operation and let me just give you a general example.  If a target was to be attacked and the unit required transport to that area, they would commandeer, they would seize a vehicle from a member of the public if he was a member of the black population.  The unit would then say \"we are APLA, we require your vehicle for a - whatever purpose and you can fetch your vehicle from such and such place, we will leave it at a certain place\" or something like that in other words the victims in that robbery situation, if I may call it robbery for the purpose of my question, were informed of what the repossession or dispossession entailed and who was involved.  With that in mind, my question is - when you went to the University of Umtata, do you know or was it your instruction for your unit, attack and support unit, to indicate to the persons inside the building that you were APLA and you were about to repossess funds for the movement or something in that line?\n\tI know it's a long question, do you follow what I'm asking you and are you able to answer that?",

I simply mention that for the information of the Committee should any questions from the Committee arise from that and suffice maybe just to mention that the high command of APLA certainly referred to the repossession units as being part of the strategy but I don't propose to cross-examine or ask questions on this aspect.  Mr Chairman, may I be permitted just to finally put to Mr Maseko one other aspect.\n\tAt page 68 of the bundle and I'm referring to the statement that you made at Westonaria.  I refer to paragraph 7, the second portion of that paragraph towards the bottom of the page and I read or I quote from the last sentence:  \"I was not doing this alone\" referring to the selling of vegetables and ice cream in the streets, \"there were people like Sangoma, Tabang, Sandile and Mantani who were helping me.  Sangoma was the driver.\"  Then you said \"I did this job until the announcement of suspension of armed struggle by the President of the PAC\" and I continue on page 70 paragraph 10 continues and you said:  \"We had two items on the agenda, one was the coming elections, two, way forward on question of elections.  We all agreed that we must help mobilise people to vote for the PAC on the question of way forward.  We all agreed that the question of armed struggle is out because the political power is in the hands of the African people whether it is ANC or not PAC, the fact is the political power is in the hands of the African people so there's no need for armed struggle.\" and you go on but I end the quotation there.

That's how I fell, the gun I was holding fell down too, I lost consciousness after that.  After some time I recovered my consciousness, I noticed that the gun I was holding was no more around.  When I looked around that the person was coming to shoot me, he was descending the stairs carrying a gun bag.  That was the end, I shouted to the fathers I thought were registering saying that they must help us because I was injured and Sergeant Mkizwayo was also injured.

As has been stated before, the applicant has applied for amnesty in respect of twenty eight occurrences.  It has been arranged and I trust it will continue, that the applicant will be kept down here for the rest of the week and that will enable his attorney to consult with him with a view to obtaining proper information about the twenty seven other matters which are subject to a hearing or either hearing or decision in Chambers but quite obviously we will require a great deal more information about them and I trust that the applicant's attorney will consult with Mr Prior as to the details required.  Once those further particulars have been obtained the matter can be fully investigated and arrangements will then be made with the legal advisers of the applicant and the victims as to the date and venue of further hearings.  It may be that the hearings will be held elsewhere and the victims taken to the scene rather than coming down here if there are no more public hearings arising out of events in this vicinity but that is a matter which will have to be arranged after consultation between the parties.  \n\tIs there anything else any of the parties wish to raise for me to make a ruling on at this stage?",

I would recommend that for their own benefit they would like to make notes of what has transpired to date to assist them but there will be a transcript made of the evidence led which will be available.\n\tA further matter which I think I should draw to the attention of the applicant's attorney and that is that we've received a further affidavit which has been affirmed to, to today and there was an annexure to it but the annexure is not in the form of an affidavit which is not being confirmed by anyone and whether any value can be attached to such a document is perhaps doubtful.
