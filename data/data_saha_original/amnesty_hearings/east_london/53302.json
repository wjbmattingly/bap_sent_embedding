The facts to which I depose are true and correct and within my personal knowledge unless the context indicates otherwise.  I was born in 1971 at Hoopstad, Free State Province.  I grew up in Wesselsbron where I did my primary education up to Standard 6 in 1984.  In 1985 my family moved to Botshabelo near Thaba Nchu where I left school at Standard 8 due to financial problems.  I joined PAC through Azania 1986.  In 1990 I left the country to Zimbabwe to Tanzania where I joined Apla and did my military training.  I came back from Tanzania at the end of 1990 and I was posted at the PAC headquarters under the command of comrade Inox Zulu and the late Jan Shoba.  Late in 1991 I was deployed in the Free State Province.  I was involved in about seven operations and I have applied for amnesty in all of them.  I confirm that I commanded the unit which split from Pila Dolo's unit that attacked houses that belonged to policemen and security personnel in the South African Lesotho borders on the 10th December 1992.  I confirm that I went with Jabu to the other house, I was armed with R4 rifle and hand grenade and Jabu was armed with an Uzi and Molotovs.  We went to the house which was plus four houses from the one Pila Dolo's unit attacked the same night.  I broke the window with the rifle butt and Jabu threw Molotovs and also threw a grenade and also fired shots.  Thereafter we retreated and joined the other unit which was commanded by comrade Dolo.  The affidavit of comrade Dolo has been read to me.  I understand the contents and I confirm it insofar as it relates to me and specifically request that same be incorporated in this affidavit.  I respectfully submit that my application complies with the requirements of the act and that I have made full and proper disclosure of my involvement in the Ficksburg operation and I accordingly humbly request that my application for amnesty be granted.\"\nChairperson, now I would ask Mr Kgotlhe then just to give clarity on certain issues.\n\tMr Kgotlhe, Mr Dolo has testified before this Committee and told the Committee that he was called by you from Sterkspruit to assist him.  Can you in your own words give full picture to the Committee as to what actually happened, how did you come to the decision that these houses should be attacked?",

I went to Sterkspruit and we discussed this with Dolo that I received an instruction that we should carry out some instructions on my side and I really needed his help to come and help in my unit.  We also discussed the importance of our operations and the reasons why we had to attack that area, that is those houses that is those houses that we ended up attacking.\n\tFrom the information that I got it was clear that this area and these houses were occupied by the members of the SADF and the South African police.  I also indicated to him that I ensured and reconnoitred the place and I also interacted with the people who were working there, domestic workers and I engaged with them in discussions to get information from them as to whether those places were occupied by the members of the regime.  That is how I ended up making a decision that we have to attack this place because they were occupied by the security personnel.

We knew that it may also happen that some houses were not owned by the South African Police but our general belief was that because most of them were occupied by the police and defence personnel we have to attack all the houses.

After the sky was eliminated then they started shooting towards our direction.  At the time we were following comrade Dolo and Roger because they were in front.

            "Thank you Chairperson.\n\tChairperson, if I may proceed and read the affidavit of Mr Kgotlhe in regard to the second incident?\n\"I, the undersigned, Able Lerato Kgotlhe, do hereby make an oath and say that I'm the applicant in the above matter having submitted my application whilst being held at Grootvlei Maximum Prison, Bloemfontein, the facts to which I depose are true and correct and within my personal knowledge unless the context indicates otherwise.  I was born in 1971 at Hoopstad, Free State Province, grew up in Wesselsbron where I did my primary education up to Standard 6 in 1984.  In 1985 my family moved to Botshabelo near Thaba Nchu where I left school at Standard 8 due to financial problems.  I joined PAC through Azania in 1986.  In 1990 I left the country through Zimbabwe to Tanzania where I joined Apla and did my military training.  I came back from Tanzania at the end of 1990 and I was posted at the PAC headquarters under the command of comrade Inox Zulu and the late Jan Shoba.  Late 1991 I was deployed in the Free State Province, I was involved in about 7 operations and I have applied amnesty for all of them.  I confirm that I was involved in the Ficksburg Townhouse attack.  We were a unit of 5 operatives.  It was myself, Nduna, Kenny, Roger, Scorpion and Max.  I was ...\"\nChairperson, just for the clarity of the Committee, Max is the second applicant, Luvuyo Kuluman, Kenneth Kuluman.\n\"I was the commander of the unit.  Our target was the old age home.  I was armed with 9 mm pistol and grenades.  Nduna armed with pistol and grenades and others armed with grenades and Molotovs.  It was our decision that if there is any ammunition, grenades and Molotovs left after the attack at the old age home we will use them to attack the town houses.  Apla regarded the Free State especially as a bastion of White inherent folkism.  It was one of the stronghold of the AWB which represented the White inherent folkism.  We travelled from Lesotho to Ficksburg on foot.  On our way to the old age home we met police vehicle patrol.  We retreated and myself and Max entered a yard of a certain townhouse.  Whilst in the yard with Max I shot the police vehicle and it sped off.  The other comrades were no longer around.  Myself and Max threw Molotovs in this house whose yard we were, we thereafter retreated and I threw a grenade in another house and it hit the window and fell on the parking area and destroyed the car which was parked there.  We then went back to Lesotho.  Apla's mode of thinking and indeed operation did not distinguish between soft and hard targets nor indeed between military and civilian targets.  When it comes to White South African society.  We were simply fighting against criminals who sustained the apartheid system.  Anybody who was playing part in moving apartheid forward and those who supported it were therefore criminals.  This was the mode of thinking in the Apla code during the struggle.  I respectfully submit that my application complies with the requirements of the Act and that I've made full and proper disclosure of my involvement in the Ficksburg Townhouse attack and accordingly humbly request that my application for amnesty be granted.\"\nThank you Chairperson.  \n\tMr Kgotlhe, can you take the Committee through with your decision to attack the old age home.  Who took the decision and the planning and why was it the specifically the target, the old age home?",

            "Firstly I would say, at the time when we identified the old age home as a target, it happened that around South Africa, especially in Johannesburg, there were attacks in trains, there were attacks in Boipatong, Sebokeng, around Sebokeng.  Black people were killed like flies.  Then the understanding of Apla was that Africans were not killing each other as it was purported to be believed.  The Africans were killed by people who were hired by Whites so that to bring the idea that Black people don't like one another.  After Apla observed that it was unacceptable for Africans to be killed in that way, so it took a step so that it will be able to make Whites feel the pain the same as Africans who felt the pain.\n\tAfter that I was given an order that I should identify a target around Ficksburg area.  The target which would bring pain, more pain which Africans felt at that time because of the killings around Johannesburg in the Vaal Triangle and in the trains.  Then I went around Ficksburg area until I come across this area called an old age home.  After I came across this area I observed the area for some time as to whether people were residing there.  After that I consulted with the director of operations, that is comrade Mphashlele to inform him that I was able to identify a target.\n\tOut of our consultations he gave me a go ahead that I should prepare to attack that particular area.  I continued to gather the final details about our security going there and returning back.  What I would explain again is that in addition to the plan which we had about the attack about that particular area was that alternatively if it happened that when we arrived at the old age home the ammunitions and the arms that should be left after the attack we would throw them randomly around the houses which were nearby or if it happened that we encountered the police before, those police would be our target and then if they would flee the ammunitions we had there, grenades and Molotovs, would throw them around the houses there.\n\tOur aim was to fight a psychological war so again in addition to our primary objective to push them further from the borders so that we'd be having a territorial advantage near the borders, that is why we were able to attack that old age home.  Fortunately, we were not able to come nearer that old age home, then we engaged ourselves with our secondary objective or secondary target.  Then I threw a hand grenade next to the house then it fell on the car park then one car was damaged.",

People who took part in the oppression included old people and young people, we did not have preferential treatment for old age people and when we responded against oppression we had to have a clear objective that oppressors were not different from the age groups, all of them were oppressors.  Then again even before they reached that old age state, they come from a certain age, they were members of the youth, they were young and then they were middle aged and they participated in the oppression and when they were old at the stage they took part in the support of apartheid and they benefited from the apartheid itself.  Why I'm saying age was not an issue is that firstly the oppressors themselves when they see me they saw me as a boy.  My father was regarded as a boy, my grandfather was regarded as a boy, my sister was regarded as a girl, my mother was a girl, so they did not differentiate between the various age groups or they didn't see a difference between me and my father or my grandfather, we were all boys so therefore we did not have a problem to respond to that oppression knowing that there was no young persons and old persons, all of them were oppressors.",
