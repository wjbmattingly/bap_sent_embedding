            "Firstly I want to make this point clear, as the Chairperson of the ANC the policy and the principles of the ANC said that no one has the right to kill, but a person has to protect himself from the enemy.\n\tThe case of Mrs Nomsa Hanabe, it was a bad case in Klipplaat.  I have a picture of the circumstances as I am sitting here.  What happened is that Mrs Hanabe was Mayoress in Klipplaat and there was a national call that the Councillors have to resign and as the ANC we had to have a programme of the resignation of the Councillors, whereby which we made attempts to try and convince these people that we are not fighting against them personally, but we are fighting against the policy of apartheid in which they were defending.  We called them one by one in a meeting and we asked them to resign.  We were trying to show them that we are not fighting against them personally but we were trying to fight against the policy.  Some of them, five of them, responded positively, and they resigned.\n\tMrs Nomsa Hanabe was a stubborn person and she told us she will never resign.  She has her own beliefs.  It is when we went to the community to tell the people about the decisions taken from the meetings we had with the Councillors.   We told the community that others have agreed to resign, but it was only \nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR BLOEM\t98\tMR BLAAU\nNomsa Hanabe who refused.\n\tIt happened that the community decided that they did not want Mrs Nomsa Hanabe in Klipplaat.  As we were still busy with that decision we heard rumours from our sources that there is a list which was provided by Mrs Nomsa Hanabe to the AmaAfrica to eliminate the leaders of the community.\n\tIt happened on that day.  It was a Friday night and three taxi's came from Uitenhage.  They were full of AmaAfrica.  There was a Magutsa family where one girl Galane received a phone call, that we know that you are one of the people who want me to resign, to step down.  I am coming together with my people.  \n\tAs we were looking at this matter we heard that AmaAfrica arrived in this Magutsa family.  They were fully armed as we were still looking at that matter, the community of Klipplaat this was new to them and this was strange to them, because in this community such a situation never prevailed.\n\tThe youth decided to go to that house to observe what was going on and we saw that some members of the AmaAfrica were outside and we tried to chase them away.  We just heard people saying, shoot, shoot, and Mpati fell down.   He was kicked as he was lying down and he was taken to the hospital.   Victor Dose tried to protect him.\n\tAs the Chairperson of the ANC I went to the police to ask them if they were aware of the situation.  When I arrived at the police there was only one police there, and we did not know what to do.  We decided to go in hiding as the leadership.  And the decision was taken and the people were still discussing how to try and chase out Mrs Hanabe in the community.\n\tAs we know in the past there were many ways we used in order to protect ourselves.  There was a caucus held and it was concluded that this person is not willing to resign and we have EAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR BLOEM\t99\tMR BLAAU\nto see what we can do about her.   And that is all.\n\tThe following day after this incident with the AmaAfrica the women in the community stood up and they marched to the police station, asking for this group to be removed from the community, and that happened.  There was a man called Jantjie, he was the leader of this group, the AmaAfrica group.   This man said they did not go there to fight but they were trying to organise their organisation.\tWe told them this was not the first time such incident happened.   There was a function at school and they were looking for the Secretary General of the ANC, Nqele in that function.  They were driving a red car but unfortunately they did not find him.",
