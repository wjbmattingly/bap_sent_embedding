The driver was inside, but inside the car he was not hit and he tried to reverse and he left and his shoe was left inside the car, and we tried to get some spades to take our car, to try to remove our car, and we left the scene.  That is what I wanted to add.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULWA:</span> No, there is nothing else.  He mentioned everything.</p>

<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Were you carrying any firearms, yourself personally?</p>

<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULWA:</span> It was an Uzzi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Amongst the - did you notice anyone else other than the ones that Mr Matshaya has mentioned, as having participated in this shoot-out from your side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULWA:</span> There was a lot of confusion, full of people, I cannot remember who else was there.   During this shoot-out there was a pandemonium, the others were crying on the other side as we were also returning fire, we also had to save them, try to remove them and try to calm them down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> From your own firing, did you see anyone amongst the people who were struck by a bullet from your firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULWA:</span> No, I do not remember seeing anyone, because the area was bushy and people would see only shadows because even if you would try to peep through and you would hear a bullet hitting nearby and you would try and take cover.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Did you have a license in respect of this firearm that you were using?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULWA:</span> Yes, we got the licences - we got the firearms from the Commander, I did not have my own license for the firearm.</p>

<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Just one Chairperson.  Mr Mdlulwa, in your application, I just want you to clarify this point, on page 52 of the paginated pages, you say on paragraph 9(b) where the question is "state whether any person was injured", you say "yes, TDF soldiers and some people killed by the bandits", what do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULWA:</span> Will you please repeat your question, sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> In your application form there some part where you say that TDF soldier was killed and you say and some "people killed by the bandits".</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULWA:</span> You want to know more about the bandits?</p>

<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MDLULWA:</span> I think that is the language used by the person who was helping me writing this statement, because I never mentioned that term, bandits.  Poswa, the person who was helping me writing the statement, may have used his own language.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I see.  Thank you, no further questions, Mr Chair.</p>

<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> There is none Judge, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MGIDLANA</p>
