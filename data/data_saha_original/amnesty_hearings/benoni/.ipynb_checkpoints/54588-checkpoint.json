            "Thank you Mr Chair.  Perhaps with your leave Mr Chairman I intend to give a little bit of background to pick up the strings, as it were.\n\tMr Chairman, the first document which I wish to refer to is the notification in terms of Section 19(4) for General Viktor to appear before you and in particular Annexure A which is attached thereto, you will observe Mr Chairman that there are really three points made, if you have that document before you, it is Annexure A attached to a letter by your Committee dated the 23rd of April 1997.  \n\tThe three issues involve the following:\n1.\tIt is quoted both Cronje and Hechter testified that the former Brigadier, i.e. Viktor, instructed them to act pro-actively.\n\t2.\tAt page 92 of the record,\n\t\t\"General van der Merwe advises the Committee that former Brigadier Viktor has a different recollection of his instruction, the instruction is crucial to and understanding of the applicant's general motivation\".\nAnd that would take up most of our time obviously Mr Chairman.  And then point three is -\n3.\tIn respect of the Nietverdiend, that is incorrectly spelt, Nietverdiend incident, Cronje testifies that Viktor phoned him and congratulated him on the execution of the operation.  This response by Viktor forms part of the general motivation of the applicants.\n\tMr Chairman why we referred to this document is that there is one other crucial incident which the officer of your Committee seems to have left out, and that concerns the evidence of Cronje in regard to a certain person that was assassinated. I am referring to this a little bit out of context if you will bear with me for a moment I will attempt to find the reference on the record where actually Brigadier Viktor is directly implicated. Perhaps my learned friend Mr Mpshe could assist me, it's either Thabedi or Sibiya, the assassination or elimination of that gentleman.  \n\tIf you will allow Mr Chairman I will find it in due course, but I just wished at this point in time to draw your attention to that incident and just in the event of your wishing to obtain clarity as far as that is concerned as well.  While the General is here he may as well answer questions on that score as well.\n\tMr Chairman, prior to today - well first of all may I refresh your memory that General Viktor has filed an application for amnesty before you.  We are not going to refer to any of the details thereof, save for saying one thing, you will observe that he does not apply for amnesty insofar as he is implicated by the present applicants in incidents.\n\tThen Mr Chairman, prior to today, an affidavit by General Viktor was filed.  May I assume that you have that before you?  Yes.  We will confirm that in evidence and there is one issue that we will have to clarify as far as that is concerned.\n\tMr Chairman before General Viktor gives his evidence may I refer you to certain portions of your record.  May I first of all say that we did not obtain the full record.  What was provided to us are quite apparently extracts from the record so that if there are other references which we are unaware of we apologise that we don't know about them.  \tBut in regard to General Viktor's evidence, as we understand the evidence of Cronje and Van Vuuren, we haven't got Hechter's evidence, was that General Viktor would have given a general instruction as a result of which certain actions were taken by the Security Branch of the South African Police Northern Transvaal.  \n\tWhat is perhaps of interest to you is to be reminded, Mr Chairman, that General van der Merwe, who gave evidence, was asked about the instructions in general in Police circles and he was cross-examined as well.  \n\tVery shortly, Mr Chairman, and we are in your hands here, I could read the evidence to refresh your memory or I could simply give you the references. General van der Merwe, at page 82 of the record, on cross-examination by Mr du Plessis gave evidence.  The question by Mr du Plessis starts at line 5 more-or-less and it deals with instructions and commands.  And General van der Merwe, at the bottom of that page refers you to the system of how commands and regulations pertained in the Police, including in the Security Branch of the Police, it goes over the page Mr Chairman.  \n\tIt's a long passage, I'm not going to read it, but may I summarise that the gist of that evidence appears to be that these were done formally, it was a formal structure in which commands were given.  Why we mention this specifically, Mr Chairman, as we will remind you and we will come to that, that Mr Cronje's evidence was that the whole Police strategy changed, as far as he was concerned, because of one telephone call he received from then Brigadier Viktor, as a result of which there was a full-scale war set afoot.   And it's against the background of that evidence that we refer you to this particular piece of evidence.\n\tMr Chairman the other issue which you might wish to consider in the evidence of General Viktor is that the evidence of Brigadier Cronje was,  that because of this general instruction a licence, as it were, was given to members of the Security Branch to act illegally.  \n\tNow General van der Merwe also gave evidence on that score at page 84 around line 26, or starting at line 22 Mr Chairman and it goes over the page.  And he continues at page 85, at line 22 referring to how the Police were supposed to act, i.e. in terms of the Police Act and regulations.\tInstructions from the Security Council etc you will find that at page 85 Mr Chairman.  The gist of which again, if I may be allowed to summarise, is that the Police at all times were required to act within the law.  That is the evidence of General van der Merwe.\n\tAnd he says at page 87, perhaps I should just read this by way of summary Mr Chairman, 87 line 28.  Mr du Plessis says,\n\"Was a decision ever taken?  Do you know of any decision policy which provided that the South African Police would not act in a reactionary way against terrorist but also pro-actively to prevent these acts?\"\nAnd General van der Merwe answers;\n\"Are you speaking generally now?\"\nMr du Plessis says,\n\"Yes\".\nAnd van der Merwe says,\n\"Apart from action abroad....\"\nand you will recall Mr Chairman that General van der Merwe drew a distinction between the conduct of the Police internally and actions abroad, and he again refers to that distinction, he says.\n\"Apart from actions abroad where the general view was that because we didn't have the various rights and competencies which we had internally, other  actions were considered legitimate in order to level the playing field in combatting the enemy.  In many cases operations undertaken outside the borders of the country were authorised by the former government, but there were also cases where, especially as far as our neighbouring states, actions were taken without them being authorised explicitly.  But where actions were taken at a local level, that is internally, as a result of the fact that the opportunity presented itself to act against somebody identified as a member of the enemy......\"\nand then Mr du Plessis refers to page 10 of the Commissioner's submission where a reference is made in the second last line at page 88 to conventional warfare.  \n\tMr Chairman he goes on further on in his evidence, may I just be allowed to summarise.  At the end of the day van der Merwe's evidence can be summarised to say that internally the Police were called upon to act and were expected to act legally.\n\tAs far as instructions further are concerned Mr Chairman may I refer you to page 89 line 21 ...(intervention)",

I am here, I am speaking from here, sorry to interrupt you, I don't know how many more pages you are going to take us through, I am just wondering whether we are not in fact not simply putting the record on record, because that's what we are doing it seems to me.  Would it not have been better if, for example, if you go stage by stage that way, at the same time we invite the witness to comment so that we could immediately capture, you refer to a passage and possibly you read it and then thereafter we invite the witness to capture his response to it as we go along.",

            "I understand Mr Chairman.  The point here, and I should have made it more clear I think, the idea was not to take General Viktor through the evidence of General van der Merwe by myself because he can't really give evidence about what van der Merwe gave, but rather where he is implicated himself.  So what I am doing at that moment is just summarising where in the record these issues do arise and what the issues are so that if cross-examination is going to be directed at General Viktor at least your Committee will know where to find these references.\n\tThere are only another five, may I give you the page numbers without any further detail.  It's page 89 at line 21, going over the page to page 90 Mr Chairman, line 18 and you can stop there.\n\tAgain at page 95, dealing with the undeclared state of war from line 3 to line 20.  \n\tThen regarding the authority of Viktor to have been able to give the instruction which Brigadier Cronje says he understood, at page 96, in our submission, is an important piece of evidence by General van der Merwe, from line 15 to line 23.  And he ends and may I be allowed to just read this to you referring to General Viktor,\n\"No, he never had the power or authority to give such an instruction\".\nThat is an instruction to eliminate and to kill.\n\tMr Chairman, as far as the Nietverdiend matter is concerned we will deal with that, the reference in the record is page 97, i.e is the third issue there on Annexure A line 14 to line 22.\n\tAnd the second-last evidence in General van der Merwe's evidence, Mr Chairman, is at page 102.  Again dealing with Viktor's instruction and the whole page is relevant, but especially from line 28 to the bottom of that page.\n\tThe last reference, Mr Chairman, as a general background, is at page 106, dealing again with illegitimate actions from line 24 to 28.\n\tI am sorry Mr Chairman there is one further one and that is the question of whether General Viktor was authorised to give instructions from higher up as it was put, and that is at page 107 line 22 from the words, \"I must, however, state.....\", over the page Mr Chairman.\n\tNot that we have been informed that this would be part of the evidence, but you will recall in the evidence of General van der Merwe, Mr Chairman, there was reference to TREVITS, and I am referring to page 108, and at .......\nPOWER FAILURE",

We are not going to go into the details of that incident but if I remember correctly what it entailed was injecting certain occupants of a combi motor vehicle and thereafter driving the combi into a ditch and blowing it up with the resulting death of some number of persons.\n\tAt page 97 of the record, at line 20 thereabouts Mr Chairman, that paragraph deals with the Nietverdiend incident, it was suggested to General van der Merwe that there would be evidence to the effect that you, General, telephoned Brigadier Cronje and congratulated him with his success of that particular operation.\n\tAnd if I then may refer you to the other references, pages 603 and following Mr Chairman.  It deals with the incident again from page 603 and at page 605, well perhaps at the bottom of 603 line 30 I may read to refresh your memory.\n\"The Botswana Police investigated this car wreck and the remains of the persons in it.  There were some newspaper reports after which General Viktor phoned me to ask me whether it had been our staff who were hurt.  I told him that was the case\".\nWell that's not strictly correct because Mr Chairman if we recall correctly I think it was a member of the South African Defence Force that was hurt, but be that as it may.\n\"I told him that was the case.

I will read to you from the record from page 9.\nThis is now in English.\n\"We will give evidence about our actions during the time of the conflict and will show that all our actions were purely and simply associated with the political objective, namely, to uphold the National Party government and apartheid, to fight communism and to resist liberation of South Africa and democracy for all in South Africa.  We are not criminals.  We have never committed any criminal deed outside the sphere of the conflicts of the past, and we have not accepted any extra financial or patrimonial incentives for anything we have done.  We believed that we acted bona fide in the interests of our country and our people.  We will show that we at all times believed that we were acting in the course and scope of our duties and within the scope of our authority\".\n\tPage 11, and I would ask you to listen very carefully please General.\n\"We, as proud Afrikaners, are part of this country and shall be part of this country in the future.  We are prepared to forgive those who have sinned against us in the past.  We have forgiven the concentration camps of the Boer War where innocent women and children have died.  We are prepared to forgive those who have waged war during the struggle, also on innocent women and children.\n\t\tWe similarly ask forgiveness for those who lost their lives and those who were injured and we share the grief of those family members of victims who have suffered during the era of conflict.  \n\t\tWe have sincere regret that people have suffered on both sides and we wish to express the sincere hope that the time for truth and reconciliation in South Africa has now arrived.\n\t\tWe call upon our superiors, and the previous government, not to deny responsibility but to stand by the people and to admit responsibility for what was done by us in our endeavours to keep them in power.\n\t\tWe all supported the National Party until 1994.  What we had done was always in the interests of the National Party and its objectives.  We believed in the policies of the National Party and believed that we had to carry out our duties in support of our party.  \n\t\tWe state emphatically that we have been deserted by the National Party and that we have so-to-speak been thrown away in the gutter where we now have to take the responsibility on our shoulders to deal with our past, to motivate our actions and to present our view, as Afrikaners, of the conflict.\n\t\tWe call upon the previous government and our superiors to explain certain orders given to us about which we shall testify and to admit to authorising actions outside the normal processes of the law such as are demonstrated by the facts of our deeds and the authorisation thereof\".\n\tNow General this is the gist of the opening statement prior to Brigadier Cronje's initial testimony, do you take note of this?",
