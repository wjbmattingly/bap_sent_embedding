<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Mr Chairman, I would ask for some direction here.  I am not sure what this Committee proposes to do.  When this Committee proposes to close for the day.</p>

<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Mabore.  Actually it was misprinted because during those days, we had problems.  Now my name is being changed to be Mabore, my real name is Mabope.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> I have found the document I was looking for, if I may proceed Mr Chairman.  Thank you for the indulgence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>	Is it correct that you are one of the applicants in this matter and an applicant in terms of you being, or having been a member of the Johannes Nkosi Unit?</p>

<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now, would you tell the Commissioners, the Honourable Committee Members before we go into the details of the acts for which you are applying amnesty, who you are, when were you born, when did you join the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Okay, actually what I will do is I will read the biography that has been prepared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>	My name is Alfas Mabore Ndlovu.  The address is 35 Esangweni Section, Tembisa.  The date of birth, 1964-07-02.  I joined the ANC and the People's Revolutionary Army, MK in September 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>	I joined the liberation forces during the time when colonialism and perilous forces were displaying African people in particular, and killing them.  The total full, calculated military aggression against the front line States, suppression of student bodies, that is COSAS and working class formations (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>	The military skills which I acquired within the ranks of the African National Congress and Umkonto We Sizwe is as follows:  I received the following military training in Angola in 1985.

<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now, will you tell the Honourable Committee members, the offences for which you are applying for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually what I would say is that I am applying for all offences which my fellow applicants spoke about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Will you please enumerate them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Number 1, that is the bombing of "Kitskonstabels" in Mnisi Section, Katlehong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> ...[inaudible] for which you are applying for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually what I would say is that I am applying for all offences which my fellow applicants spoke about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Would you please enumerate that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>MR NDLOVU</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>1)	Number 1: That is the bombing of "Kitskonstabels" in Mnisi Section, Katlehong.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>2)	The bombing of sewerage pipes in Sunwatt Park.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>3)	The bombing of "Kitskonstabels" and SAP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you carry on, the bombing of the "Kitskonstabels" in Mnisi Section, what did you so there?  What was your role in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> My role was that physically and practically I went there to execute the operation and even part of the planning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Okay, the second one is the bombing of the sewerage pipe.  In this one I do agree with my fellow applicants, that together being a unit that was stationed or to organise activities around East Rand, I also planned and approved the operations that it must executed.  ...[indistinct] the planning.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>4)	The third one: Ambush of the "Kitskonstabels" and SAP in the Motsamai Section.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>My role, it was that I went there physically and I took part in the execution of the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> How?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> By carrying an AK rifle and went there to demoralise the enemy by firing shots.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>5)	The other one is the bombing of Wimpy Bar.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>And this one I went there personally to execute the operation.  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>6)	The bombing of the rail line and electrical sub-station next to Katlehong Station.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>My role was that I went there physically to execute the operation in benefit of our people.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>7)	The last one - not last.  The bus terminus in Germiston.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>I also took part in planning and giving the approval with other comrades and my commanders, that the operation should be carried out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Is it correct that the incidents that you are referring to are all enumerated on page 10 of Exhibit A?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Is it also correct that in all these operations, even though you did not personally, you may not have personally carried out or executed an act, however you were involved in the planning thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes, I was involved in the planning and the other things, the operations which were being carried out by our sub-unit.  That is the attacks against councillors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I didn't hear that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> I'm talking about the attacks against councillors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> What about them, did you also take part in their planning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know the names or identities of these councillors who were victims or possible victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> No, I don't know the identities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you don't know if any attack took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually through media we heard the reports ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't know yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't know yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually I'm trying to indicate that operations were being carried out, especially by our sub-unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> But didn't your sub-unit come back to report to you as people who must have been higher than them, about how they had fared with the operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually, when it comes to that issue, they do give reports but it was not possible or easier to locate our comrades, especially in the sub-units, to give proper reports because we also were operating under difficult conditions which were by that time, it was not conducive enough for our units to operate.  We operated under difficult conditions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Difficult conditions which made it impossible for your sub-units to come back and give you reports about operations that you had given them instruction to execute?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes, that's too difficult to locate our  units, especially after operations you find that, let's say a person might be under serious stress or either fear of being caught, would take retreat position or take underground retreat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> How many instructions did you give to these sub-units to carry out in respect of the councillors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually the instructions which we gave is that they were collective, not as an individual.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Was it at one given time or were you able to meet and give them further instructions with regard to the conduct of further operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually what I can say on that issue is that we do, sometimes we do meet but not meeting - how can I put it, regularly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I'm still a little unclear about it, how these instructions were given and how reports were actually given to you from your sub-units.  You must have been in some kind of control of your sub-units?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes, we do have the control but the other thing is that a unit cannot give, let's say names, we have to consider the security situation, that we are not allowed, we are going to guerilla warfare, that we should write reports.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> The only reason why we are posing these questions is we have to ascertain whether there was an offence which was committed or not before we can either consider whether you qualify for amnesty or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I hope you understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> I'm saying that to throw a grenade against a councillor, during those days and even presently, it is an offence according to the law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Yes, but you don't know whether that grenade was thrown to a councillor or not since no reports were ever given back to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> What I'm trying to indicate is that new in the newspapers were being read, that there were attacks, and we knew that our sub-units were carrying attacks against councillors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Sir, can you maybe state to us how did you ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> May I just say that there are no further questions from my side at this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KOOPEDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV STEENKAMP:</span> I apologise Mr Chairman, to my colleague there as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>	Sir, can you state how did you see or how did you understand your political motive?  Can you explain to us your political motive for engaging in these acts for which you are applying for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> The political motive, it has been stated by my fellow applicants, and I don't think that we have to continue with the same question in different forms, because it has been answered by my fellow applicants and even my commander as a head of the unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> But Mr Ndlovu, you are before us as an applicant, and if we had to look at you and say the others have answered for you, what would ...[indistinct] be saying what you said before us, which would be considered either to grant or refuse amnesty, we wouldn't be having that.  So it might be a repetition but please answer the questions as posed to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Will you repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Can you indicate to us what your political motive was, or how did you understand your political motive at the time, when committing these acts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> The political motive was that I wanted to liberate our country from colonial forces and imperialist forces because our people were being under constant military attacks, assaults and tortures.   And again, to boost the moral of our people and to secure a clear environment for victory in our liberation struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Help me if I'm wrong.  I don't know the ANC policies as well as you do, but was it also the ANC policy to act against colonialism or actions, or can you explain what the ANC policy was regarding these attacks?  How did you understand the ANC policy regarding the identification of targets.  Let's start there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually what I can say is that when it comes to ANC policy, the policy of the African National Congress there's never mentioned in its political history that we should attack whites in particular.  And again there is no policy in the ANC that states that we should run amok attacking civilians, either black or white.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Who gave you your instructions Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> To do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Sorry.  In the Wimpy Bar and the Katlehong incidents, who gave you your instructions in those incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually in that question, the decision was taken after we have met and we have discussed extensively about the presence of the enemy at Wimpy Bar, but Wimpy Bar, it was not the actual target, our target was these people who were murdering our people and sustaining apartheid structures within our country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> And who did the reconnaissance in the Wimpy Bar incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually I was given the mandate to that, to do that reconnaissance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Can you tell us what exactly you reported?  What information did you get that you reported to your commanding officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually, the reports were as follows:  Every Saturday, because the enemy spent sleepless nights working overtime until Saturdays, Sundays, during the week.  The information was that the security, especially those who are from the higher ranks, were meeting there inside the Wimpy Bar to debrief their informers, to extract information from various operatives under their command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Where did this information come from, where did you get this information from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually the information, it was from the former political detainees around our country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Sir, help me if I'm wrong please.  On your own you couldn't verify this, you heard this from other detainees, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> No, you are wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Can you explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually we got information from former political detainees, those who were involved in our revolution, that those policemen were buying food from Wimpy Bar and they are frequenting the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> But have you seen this yourself, have you seen police actually buying, Security Branch police visiting and frequently the place, having meetings with informers, did you see this yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> How did you identify the Security Police, did you know them, because we all know they were wearing plain clothes?  Did you identify them yourself and the informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually I've seen them several times doing their job inside Wimpy Bar and so through continued reconnaissance we have decided, together with my fellow applicants, that our operation should be carried out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> But how did you know they were Security Branch police but just visiting the Wimpy Bar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually they were using or utilising the cars which belonged to the state with the registration at the end, B and in the beginning, B.  So that is the identification that this vehicle belonged to the state.  Whatever they are wearing civilian clothing, an enemy is an enemy, it can't change.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Did you know there was a police kiosk just opposite the Wimpy Bar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Our mandate or our main focus was not ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> No, no, my question is: "Did you know there was a police kiosk opposite the Wimpy Bar"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Didn't you see it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> If I put it to you that evidence will be led that there was a kiosk operating, it was an operational kiosk used by the police, or basically a small police station, you can't say anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually what I can say is these are news and the new information for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> But Sir, you did the reconnaissance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> You frequented this area, as I understand from your commanding officer, not once but a few times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes, but the concentration was not on a kiosk, we wanted to hit the main target, the main planners.  Kiosk it was nothing because let's say we have attacked their seniors, it will put a direct impact on the psychology of apartheid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> My question is this Sir, the Wimpy Bar had a lot of civilians, we know today that no police were killed.  Opposite the Wimpy Bar there are police, a lot of police, and you're saying now today that you didn't want to attack the police ...[indistinct] opposite but rather the one or two individuals in the Wimpy Bar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> I've answered that question, that I couldn't know that there was a kiosk.  If I'd known by that time I think they're also going to be our target because we wanted to attack the enemy whatever they are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Maybe you can answer this question, who decided to attack this Wimpy Bar on this specific day and specific time, was it you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Will you repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Who decided on this specific day, which was a Saturday at noon, 12 o'clock, who decided at this specific time this bomb must be planted and the operation must be executed?  Who decided on this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually the whole unit decided on that because we took a common grounds, especially on planning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> So wasn't the reason because it was the anniversary that you decided on this specific day, not because people were frequenting this place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> No, actually what I'm trying to say is that we took a general planning and we took a collective mandate or to execute the operation.  And the other thing is that we were celebrating the anniversary of the South African Communist Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> So that's the reason why you decided on a week day, or early morning, or late afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Will you repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Why did you decide on a weekend, or during the week, or early morning, or late afternoon, why noon on a Saturday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes, we have to decide for Saturday because the enemy was supposed to be there exactly 12 o'clock or past.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> You planted the bomb as well, I mean the limpet mine, yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes, I did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> When you planted the limpet mine, did you see any police in the Wimpy Bar at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually during the time when I went there to organise the thing we knew that their are coming.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> No, no, no, my question is Sir, according to our information this limpet was planted inside the Wimpy on a leg of a table, am I right?  That's right, that's were the limpet mine was planted, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Not on the leg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Where was it planted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Underneath the table.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Underneath the table.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> And you did it yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes, I did it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> When you did this, this is my question, did you see any police, security, high brass police in the Wimpy Bar when you planted that bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually I've been repeating that the enemy by that time, they were supposed to be there at twelve.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Sir, you said repeatedly you knew these people, you identified them, you did reconnaissance.  My easy question is, I think it's just yes or no, were there police inside the Wimpy or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually what I can say is that through my reconnaissance it's been said that the police personnel and those who belong to the high structures are visiting or frequenting that Wimpy Bar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ndlovu, when you planted the bomb, were there policemen that you knew of in the Wimpy Bar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> What I can say is that ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see any policemen there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Is not(?)</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>INTERVENTION BY AUDIENCE CLAPPING AND COMMENTING</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm not going to tolerate that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> I'm sorry Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>	Sir, did you check, before you planted this bomb, that there actually were other people or police close by the Wimpy Bar?  Before you did that, did you check whether or not there were police close or even inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> I have checked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> And what did you see, did you see any police close by?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually through my reconnaissance, as I have indicated, at 12 they were supposed to be there and so attacking Wimpy Bar, it was meant for attacking, it was not meant to attack civilians.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Sir, to be frank and honest with you, you knew very well because you knew the place, there was no police inside or even close to the Wimpy Bar.  Am I right in saying this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> No, you're wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He just said so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>	Did you get paid?  How did you sponsor yourself, or this trip, did you get paid, did you get any amount of money for this work you've done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually we were being assisted from our frontal commands, to be sustained, especially financially.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, the question is: "Did you get paid for doing this job"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] question was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Can you answer the question?  Did he answer, I didn't hear.  Thank you Mr Chairman, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>	Sir, who was your commanding officer and who gave you your instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> For attacking the Wimpy Bar and the attack on the police in Katlehong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually what I said previously is that we took a decision together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Because I don't see that anywhere in your application which was submitted to the TRC, can you give an explanation for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Can you repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> I don't see this information anywhere in your amnesty application which was submitted to the TRC, that you took a decision collectively, and you don't mention anybody.  Is there a reason for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually through our organigramme it has been stated that our structure, it was structured the way it exists on the bundle of papers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> No, I'm talking about your own application.  I can refer you to your application ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> With respect to my learned friend, the organigramme was supplied as part and parcel of the further particulars requested by the TRC from all the applicants.  It may well have been supplied by one of them but this refers to all of them and it would improper and unfair to say that this organigramme is not part of his application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] Mr Steenkamp, look at page 32.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> I've seen it Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>	My last question to you Sir, I see here in your application you refer to page 32, paragraph 11(b):</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>"The order by Chris Hani at Zimbabwe"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>What is the relevance of this information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually what I can say ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What's the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>	I see you are stating there, on the question: "Who gave such an order".  You said:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>"It was in line by ANC police to conduct such an act.  The order by Chris Hani at Zimbabwe"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually we never instructed by Chris Hani to attack a Wimpy Bar because Hani belonged to the MHQ, he never issued out such an instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Can you explain to me what your role was in the Katlehong attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Which one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> The one where the police were injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> What was my role?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Yes.  The Lindela Hostel, can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes, I remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Can you tell me what your role was exactly and your part there in that action?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> My role in that action, we went there to execute the operation by shooting at the enemy personnel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Why did you decide on this specific place, Katlehong, was there a specific reason or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually we decided to attack the enemy at that point because we knew and we were reconnoitring that area, that the enemy they are exchanging their shifts using that barrack within the hostel vicinity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Can you just indicate to me, as far as your knowledge serves you, as far as I know there are two incidents where people were injured or killed, this is the Wimpy incident and the Katlehong incident.  Are you aware of any other incidents where you were involved in where people were either injured or killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually what I can say is that we have been reading newspapers.  We couldn't go back and verify because the only thing we knew was that was an enemy, enemy territory.  In order to verify we are supposed to be taking other initiatives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Re-examination Mr Koopedi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Nothing in re-examination, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR KOOPEDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Ndlovu, my questions are going to be in respect of your reconnaissance with regard to the Wimpy bombing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>	I want to know how long it took you to do your reconnaissance in terms of days, in terms of weeks, in terms of months?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually we took several months monitoring that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> How several, two, three months?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> I cannot remember because it's an old incident, but what I'm saying is that several months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> With whom were you when you were doing your reconnaissance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> I was on my own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And the information that you had received from the ex-detainees, what exactly did it contain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually the information contained that when people were being captured for being involved in the liberation struggle, they could be taken to Benoni Police Station and then during the process of undergoing severe interrogation, they could be taken to the Wimpy and those security guys would buy food and eat there, went back to the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> So the information was that the people who were detained were taken to Wimpy by the security members, given food and then taken back to the police station for further interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> What I'm saying is that they could be taken there - let's say they are inside this security cars and so the security personnel, they will went inside buy food and then they will come back and take them to the prison.  The other thing, they could go there on a daily basis for consultations or to plan other operations which we couldn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> So the information was that the security members were frequenting that particular Wimpy Bar on a daily basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And it wasn't that they went there on Saturdays?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually what they were doing is that they could frequent the area every day because enemy we knew that it was operating seven days in a week, because they couldn't rest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> What kind of information did you elicit from your reconnaissance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually the information that I've got is that the enemy forces were frequenting the Wimpy Bar and on Saturday, specifically Saturday, they could organise a meeting there or take their lunch after their ...[indistinct] or extracting information from their ...[indistinct].</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And how was this information obtained, how were you able to obtain this particular information with regard to the meeting on Saturdays?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually I've managed to extract the information because I was also using a Wimpy Bar to get food and to listen and to see the environment inside, what they are doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And in your frequenting the Wimpy Bar for purposes of collecting this kind of information, were you able to see whether there were any black patronage of that particular Wimpy Bar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually in my position what I've noticed is that if the enemy is within the given territory with the support groups, meaning people who are supplying the enemy with information, they could be there always, especially on Saturday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> So in brief what you are saying is that you were able to observe black patronage in that particular Wimpy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> How big was that compared to the overall number of people that you were able to observe, for the past three months that you did your reconnaissance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Will you repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> How big was the black presence of people who were patronising Wimpy?  You were able to do this reconnaissance for the past two to three months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> What I can say is that our people couldn't have a chance to enjoy themselves, especially in Wimpy Bars ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> How big?  I'm talking of numbers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Oh, the number?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> I cannot remember but they were very, there were a few but what I can say, I'm not so sure if I can say there were a few.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Were you able to also observe the number of workers who were at Wimpy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Generally I could say they were plus minus 6 or 7, not so sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And did you give this information to your command structure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And was there any attitude adopted with regard to the presence of black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually what I can say is that when we planned to execute that operation, our main objective was to attack the enemy forces, not civilians as it has been stated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Yes.  And how did you hope to achieve that, after you had seen that there was a small presence of black people frequenting that particular Wimpy?  How would you then have averted a civilian attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually I'm having a problem concerning the concept, civilian.  During the year 1985, our comrade President, Oliver Tambo, once spoke about a civilian and a policeman.  Now my problem is, how do you differentiate between a person in uniform and a person in civilian clothing but serving the same principle, being a policeman in disguise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Did you take any precautions at all Mr Ndlovu, to avert any civilian casualty?  Can you honestly say that you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Can you repeat yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Did you take any precautions to avert any civilian casualties, in carrying out your operation in that particular Wimpy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes, we did take precaution.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Can you explain what precautions you took?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> The precaution is that during our operation we knew that that Wimpy Bar, especially 12 o'clock, the enemy forces will be there in large numbers and even their recruits in our townships, to supply them with information and to debrief their agents.  According to the area - according to the building itself, the Wimpy, it could not accommodate a large number of people and we know that by that time the enemy forces will be inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> What time did you go into this particular Wimpy to plant the bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> If I could remember, if my memory serves me well, I was there plus minus ten, half past ten, I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Half past ten.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> I'm not saying half past, I'm saying from ten onwards until half past, I'm not so sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And the people who were there, were you able to observe any security members, of the people who were already there at 10 o'clock or past 10 o'clock?  Were you able to recognise any members of the Security Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Will you repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Of the people who were there when you went in at past ten, were you able to recognise any members of the Security Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> As I'm saying that you could recognise the enemy presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> You could?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> I'm saying that you could recognise the enemy presence by the virtue of, they are utilising their state vehicles, meaning that they could be around there or waiting outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Were you able to identify any vehicles belonging to the state at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes, because I have been carrying reconnaissance against the enemy forces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> So from your prognosis, you then concluded that there should be the presence of the enemy inside Wimpy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> If they were not inside, it simply means that they were on stand-by to attend a meeting,  Outside, they may be outside or whatever, corner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> They would be outside until about 12 o'clock, because your reconnaissance had actually elicited information that the meeting at about 12 o'clock, that's your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And they would be standing outside from about 10 o'clock until 12 o'clock?  Could that have been probable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> I'm not so sure about that because when I'm saying that - let's say somebody is attending a meeting, he can decide to stand outside.  Let's say like he will be taking a cigarette and smoke for a while ...[indistinct] to a meeting or he is still busy with somebody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> With regard to the Lindela Hostel attack, how many people did you actually shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually you couldn't went back to the enemy forces and ask them that: "How many people have been attacked"?, but what has been happening is that you have been reading reports from media, especially from Citizen or whatever newspaper, if I remember very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> From which position did you shoot at these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually would you clarify your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> If you are unable to know how many people you shot at - did you shoot at a police vehicle with the "Kitskonstabels" inside the car or what happened?  How did the ambush take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> We shot them while they were inside the thing, inside the truck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Inside the truck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Mm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Thank you, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Just two Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>	Just returning to the Wimpy Bar incident.  Other than the state vehicles, did you know any Security Branch policemen?  Other than the vehicles you saw parked there and the assumption that it belonged to them, they might be in Wimpy Bar, did you know any?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually their appearance you could see that this guy he belongs to the state.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Wimpy Bar had the hall, restaurant itself for eating inside and there were people who could also dine outside, would I be right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> If I could remember well, I'm not so sure about dining outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> In fairness to you, we have several statements that say some would dine outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> I can't remember that because it is an old incident, I cannot remember everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Now let's return to your bundle, your application itself, page 32, paginated.  In response to a question asked there you said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>"It was in line with the ANC policy to conduct such an act"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>And if we look at your application you are talking about the "Kitskonstabels", you are talking about Wimpy Bar, why now singular it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Will you repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> If you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>"in line with the ANC policy"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>then you say:  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>"policy to conduct such an act",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>you are not speaking of acts and you are making application for several acts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> What I can say, especially when it comes to the position of ANC policy, yes, it's being a policy to attack an enemy forces but not to attack civilians.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> No, no, I think we are at cross-purposes here.  I say my reading, correct me if I'm wrong, I say reading this submission you are making, you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>"such an act"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>and when we listen to your evidence, you are applying for several acts or attack acts, if I may put it that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> I think it was a mistake and you have to understand that English is not my mother tongue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> And you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>"The order by Chris Hani at Zimbabwe"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>Did Hani give you any orders whilst he was at the HMQ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Actually the orders that we have been given, we've been given the order during the time when we were stationed at Zimbabwe.  And now it is being ordered that we should escalate assaults and intensify attacks against enemy forces and we have to take the struggle into the white areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR NLDOVU:</span> Okay, thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
