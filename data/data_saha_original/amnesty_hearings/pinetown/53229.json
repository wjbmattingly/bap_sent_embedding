            "Well in the event that I do, Honourable Member Judge Khampepe, I'm sure that you'll put me straight.\n\tMembers of the Committee, we've heard over some five or six weeks of testimony last year, a trail of destruction, of murder, of attempted murder, which to all of us and indeed Members of the Committee who have sat in countless applications, I'm sure even for yourselves that much of what was heard was quite shocking.  And of course in many, many other applications a similar history, a similar background, has been painted, and similar incidents and events have been committed and have been spoken about.  \n\tBy way of seeking amnesty in this application, we found it particularly difficult to identify the specific offences, more particularly in relation to the individuals who were the victims of those offences, and Members of the Committee will see that what we've sought to do in the schedules attached to our Head of Argument, is to set out as best we can the various acts, omissions and offences in respect of which amnesty is sought.  So far as we can tell through going through these schedules carefully we've covered all the necessary incidents.  For example it might be recalled in the evidence of Mr Dlamini, he withdrew his request for amnesty in respect of one particular incident because he wasn't able to clarify in his mind just which incident it was although it did appear in his statement and it got mixed up with some of the others.  That incident doesn't appear in these schedules, and we've done the best job that we can and we hope that they're all in order.  Those are the acts and offences in respect of which we apply for amnesty.  They cover, as of course you're aware, a number of years, commencing on the whole in 1986, when each of the three applicants whom I represent, received training, well two of them received training, one of them was involved in doing the training at the Caprivi, and then they returned, and from that time, from late 1986 until into 1993, they were involved in a whole range of incidents, as the Committee's heard.\n\tBy way of comparative background, it may be worth giving some brief consideration to one event in the second world war, and I have alluded to this in my Heads of Argument, and I do it only to answer the vexing question as to whether the so called random attacks on civilians and in civilian areas, can be regarded to be attacks associated with a political objective, as the requirement of Section 20, sub 1, of the Act which covers these proceedings dictates.  And it will no doubt be known to Members of the Committee and indeed possibly better known to you than to me because I'm no historian, that towards the later stages of the second world war Allied Bomber Command took a decision to deliberately bomb civilian areas in Germany, and more particularly in Dresden, being the more significant or well known of these incidents.  And in February 1945, Sir Arthur Harris, who headed that bomber command and became known as Bomber Harris, was instrumental in taking that decision, and attacks were launched on civilian areas in the city of Dresden.  In the first night alone 772 aircraft dropped bombs on Dresden, and it's unclear but the estimates range between 50 000 and 250 000 people were killed in the ensuing weeks of attack.  And that incident in particular has raised much moral controversy at the time and subsequently, as to whether that could have been justified, or was justified.  And the way in which it was justified at the time, or the objective which was given, sought to explain that activity.  There were many.  \n\tThe first was, and perhaps the most prominent, was that it was an attempt to lower the civilian morale in Germany at the time, and to try and ensure that German citizens removed their support for the Nazi war effort, and it was consequently to make the continuance of the war more costly for civilians.  It was also described as a policy of dehousing, as opposed to trying to kill civilians particularly, but to dehouse them, because that then placed added demands politically and in the form of resources.  And it was even regarded to be something of a retaliation for the ongoing attacks in London, although there was no equity there inasmuch as only some 60 000 people, civilians, were estimated to have been killed in bombings in England, and some 800 000 in Germany during the course of the war.\n\tNow of course, the question or the issue before the Amnesty Committee is not one of morality, and the debate which has focused or centred on the bombings of Dresden, has been one largely of morality.  But the Members of the Committee are not called upon to make a moral judgement as to whether the incidents in respect of which we seek amnesty were morally justifiable.  And indeed in respect of some of them it would be very difficult to advance an argument that they were morally justifiable.  But the way in which the Act has been structured, and the political compromise that was reached, is in my understanding and in my submission one which doesn't pertinently raise that question of morality.  \n\tThe Members of the Committee are asked to decide, amongst other things, whether those acts were ones associated with a political objective, and then there're other considerations in particular which are set out, which would assist the Members of the Committee in arriving at their conclusions as to whether those acts were really ones associated with a political objective.  And we submit that in each of the incidents, and we don't intend traversing each one although we will draw specific attention to some of them, we submit that in each of the incidents it has been established with sufficient certainty that the acts were acts associated with a political objective, and that includes the so called random attacks, and I'll get to those more specifically.",

            "If I understand the Committee Member correctly that's particularly in relation to orders being given.  Yes indeed, indeed.  Of course, it's my submission that it's not a requirement, inasmuch as someone may be placed in a position where they have the authority to make the decisions, and to order and to command others to do certain things, and they're not themselves acting under orders, yet they would qualify for amnesty, or the circumstances might be such that they would qualify for amnesty.  And that applies in particular in the case of Mr Luthuli in these hearings, that there are occasions in which he didn't necessarily have specific orders, he had general orders, and he had authority, and in, within the scope of that authority he then took decisions which involved either himself acting on things or ordering other people to do so.\n\tSo it's in my submission not a requirement but that, where there are order from high authority, then it's that much easier for the Committee to conclude that it's an act associated with a political objective.\nNow insofar as the various incidents are concerned, as I've indicated, we will draw particular attention to some of them, but it's not, in our submission, practical to deal with every single one.  We would be here for a week, and in respect of some it may not be necessary at all, and we would be wasting your time.  But in the event that Members of the Committee have particular concerns or questions about any particular incidents, then obviously we would welcome the opportunity to  address you on those particular concerns.  It may be that we don't ourselves have all the facts and the record immediately to hand, but we would be able to do so as quickly as possible. \n\tMembers of the Committee will notice that in the schedules that we've prepared there are cross-reference from the affidavits forming the applications by the members, and to them the places in the record where the incidents are dealt with.",

But in respect of amnesty in particular, he can only, in my submission, apply for amnesty in respect of offences which he, for which he himself might be convicted, and so where some of his Caprivi trainees have gone and done certain things that he knew nothing about and hadn't specifically ordered them to, he would be a step removed, and the prospects of conviction on those things would be negligible ...(intervention)",

The Members of the Committee are well aware, having sat through many applications, but it is nevertheless a critical point to traverse, and that's the background to the political conflict between Inkatha or the IFP, I'll use the terms interchangeably, on the one hand, and the ANC, UDF on the other, and that's well documented and indeed there have been findings by the Truth Commission itself in respect of that conflict.  And I've set out extracts from some of those findings in my Head of Argument.  \tIndeed the findings, or the chapter dealing with KwaZulu Natal in particular and the findings in relation to that, give even more detail than what I've set out here.

            "MR STEWART",
            "Thank you, thank you Mr Chairperson.\nThat then takes me to the role of each of the individual applicants in broad terms.  The Committee of course is well familiar with these as well, so I won't traverse it in detail.  \n\tThe important point insofar as Luthuli is concerned, is the way in which he, on being released from prison having been there on charges related to ANC activities, then wore two hats for a period, ANC and IFP.  And that was a period in history where that, the relationship between the two organisations allowed that, and indeed encouraged it.  And then shifted his allegiances over a period of time to the IFP and became involved intensively in IFP activity.  Initially in organising  the formation of the trade union Uwusa and then on being recruited into this role as political commissar in the Caprivi, and subsequently to being the commander, or what he described as the overall commander of the Caprivi trainees on their return and their deployment in KwaZulu Natal.\n\tNow at this point it's worth digressing slightly to try and develop something of an analysis as to what happened in that time period.  It was clear, in my submission, that on the Caprivi trainees returning to KwaZulu Natal there were structures in place, there was quite a sophisticated idea at least as to how those structures should work.  The Caprivi trainees were split up into different groups, as the Committee is well aware, the offensive group, defensive group, contra mobilisation, and so on.  And they were each supposed to have their own roles, and they were commanded, below Luthuli, by particular people, and there was the planning committee with the ongoing liaison between the IFP people responsible on the one hand, being chiefly NZ Khumalo and Mr Luthuli, and on the other hand the SADF and the SAP.  And Luthuli speaks about the first meeting of the planning committee, which he attended.\nAnd at that time it seems that there was an attempt to implement those structures, and ensure that those groupings worked in the way in which it had been planned that they would work.  \n\tAnd the kwaMakutha massacre which took place relatively shortly after the return of the Caprivi trainees, and which was perpetrated in, initially at least, a model way inasmuch as it, there was prior surveillance, there was a reporting back, there was proper planning, there was a proper liaison between the military and military intelligence and SAP security branch on the one hand, and the Caprivi trainees on the other, and then the move in to hit the house.  It turned out that it may have been the wrong house, but certainly it turned out that it may not have been planned that so many uninvolved people were murdered.  But prior to that it seemed that it was implemented in the fashion that had been intended.\n\tBut we also know that, from what Luthuli has told the Committee, that he became, on returning from Caprivi and attending the first planning committee, and seeing the involvement of the SADF through military intelligence, and the SAP through the security branch, he became concerned about the extent to which, as he put it, the boers were directing things, and the extent to which Inkatha was dependent on the boers.  And he then didn't attend planning committee meetings thereafter, save for one which he was called to, to attend to explain a certain incident. \n\tAnd so right from then the channels of command started to disintegrate, and although we have statements in the affidavits and on record about how things were intended to happen, and how things were intended, and how orders were intended to be relayed, that as time goes on we see that those structures were operating in the initial planned fashion less and less.  There was a level of disintegration, there was a level of informality, whereas at the beginning, for example, reports to NZ Khumalo were done only through Luthuli.  It happened fairly soon after the kwaMakutha massacre, for example, that some of the Caprivi trainees were reporting directly to NZ Khumalo themselves.  They were going direct to NZ Khumalo themselves to get weapons.  And that sketch of an analysis as to how things became less formal, and the lines of command became less formal, explains, in my submission, how it is that in certain circumstances there were attacks where there hadn't been specific instructions.  There were general instructions, about fighting the ANC, about clearing ANC people out of certain areas, and so on, but no necessarily a specific instruction from the highest command.  \n\tAnd we saw also then an attempt to integrate the Caprivi trainees into first, well at one time into, well let me not use the word integrate.  There was an attempt to offer the Caprivi trainees some sort of cover under the auspices of the KwaZulu police by the issue of appointment certificates, and even by the stationing of certain of the Caprivi trainees at KZP police stations.  Mr Mkhize, my learned friend Mr Wills' client, being stationed at the police station in Izingolweni for example.  And then, we saw an attempt, and now I use the word integrate, to integrate the Caprivi trainees into the special constable forces of the South African Police, and we have that particularly from Mr Khumalo and Mr Dlamini.  Mr Khumalo explains how they were trained at Koeberg, they returned to Pietermaritzburg, they had certain duties there, but in respect of themselves and some of those that were with them, that only lasted a month or two and then they became disgruntled and they left.  But all of that is an indication, in my submission, of this lack of formality in the lines of command, and the cross over in areas of responsibility between the formations of the South African Government on the one hand and the formations of the KwaZulu Government and the IFP on the other.  And as I've suggested it explains that in certain circumstances the strict lines of command, or channels of command, weren't necessarily followed.\n\tI've dealt briefly with the position of Luthuli, but to add to that, and it fits into the picture I've tried to portray, whereas Luthuli was initially regarded as being the overall commander, really responsible for the deployment of all these people around KwaZulu Natal, and telling them what to do, not long after he returned from Caprivi he was sent by NZ Khumalo to Hammarsdale Mpumalanga specifically to take care of problems there himself, and he resided there, and he was involved in attacks on people's houses and so on, as it is documented.  And that's not consistent with a continuing role of an overall commander.  Or it's not entirely consistent.  He continued to play something of an overall commanding role, but as I've suggested NZ Khumalo was playing more of a hands on role, and indeed many other people he mentioned.  Captain  Langeni, and others.  And once again that explains in at least part why certain lines or channels of command may not have been followed.  Perhaps it can be, perhaps also it can explain why, in my submission, it's inappropriate to try and place each incident into a model framework, a model framework which had been intended to operate at the beginning, but which clearly didn't operate for very long.\n\tIn respect of Khumalo, his history is set out, how he became involved in the IFP, thought he was going to be a policeman, he got taken off to the Caprivi, he was trained along with Dlamini in this very intensive counter-revolutionary or guerrilla warfare, urban guerrilla warfare, with explosives, high powered armaments, and so on and so forth.  And then coupled with that was the political indoctrination and training about who is the enemy, who are we going out to kill, what our job is on returning to KwaZulu Natal.  And that sets up a background for him, which indicates that unless there's some clear indication to the contrary, the various hits that he was involved in, the various incidents that he was involved in, were in pursuance of that overall political objective which he had been instructed to pursue when he came back to KwaZulu Natal.  \tWe know as well that he was one of the witnesses in the case of the State v Msani, which was the so called Malan trial, and indeed has given in other cases, and on Luthuli's encouragement, he told his story to the ITU and he was then placed in witness protection, and has given statements explaining various incidents.  \nIt's not a case, and by this I don't mean to detract from the validity of the applications of Mr Wills' clients at all, but this is not a case of someone who's in prison, whose been convicted of something, and who's now seeking to get out and this is the one hope there is, is amnesty.  \n\tThe Committee, Members of this Committee and indeed Members of other Amnesty Committees that have sat, have on  occasion refused amnesty where clearly those were cases where someone's been convicted of something, they try and dress it up in political clothes in order to try and get out of prison.  These in respect of those applicants that I represent, that doesn't apply.  And in respect of most of the incidents, or certainly many of the incidents that they've been involved, they have been the only sources of information in the hands of the State, broadly speaking about these incidents.  It's not as 'though they faced imminent prosecution.  They've come in a genuine effort to tell their whole story.  Khumalo was also issued with a KZP appointment certificate and, as I've indicated, he did spend some time as a special constable.\n\tBy way of cross-reference, as it were, the Committee will be well aware of the amnesty application of Brian Mitchell, in which Brian Mitchell was granted amnesty, were some detail is given as to the purpose of the training of special constables, and the incorporation of Caprivi trainees within the special constable force of the SAP and the deployment of them to various areas, and the involvement in fighting the ANC, taking that fight to the streets of township and rural areas.\n\tInsofar as Dlamini is concerned I must, at the outset, make the apology that I've made the error of putting an H in Mr Dlamini's name when it shouldn't be there.  His name is D L A M I N I, not D H L, so I apologise to Members of the Committee for that.  \nAt the time that Mr Dlamini was sent to the Caprivi for training, he was only 16, and in the years before that he had already been involved in violent conflicts between Inkatha and ANC or UDF supporting youths, and he had come from that politicised background at the hands of Zakele Mkehle in the Hammarsdale area, and also on the understanding that he was now being trained to be a policeman he was sent to Caprivi, and received the same intensive military or para-military training that the others received.  And really, that's all he's known from that age until now.  And all that he's been involved in, as documented in these papers, stems from that background.  He also was issued a KZP appointment certificate at one stage, and was trained as a special constable.  And once again, on the encouragement of Luthuli, he left where he was at the time, which was essentially gun running for Themba Khoza in Johannesburg, and he left on Luthuli's encouragement to come clean, as it were, and to tell his story.\n\tThat takes me then to, I'm on page 15 of my Heads of Argument, it takes me then to the specific requirements of the Act insofar as amnesty is concerned, and the first one which I seek to deal with is the one of full disclosure.  Now it's not uncommon in amnesty applications for applicants to apply for amnesty but to seek to limit their culpability in certain respects, in particular to limit it to what information might be otherwise available to the Members of the Committee or available to the Prosecution Services.  And one's seen, in my submission, in certain case, attempts by amnesty applicants in that way really to say I'm applying for amnesty for a incident that I was involved in, but I was not involved in anything else, where we know that it's simply not credible for that claim about non-involvement in anything else to be, simply not credible to make that claim.  But because there's only public information about their involvement in incident A that's the only one that's applied for.  Now these applications, those of my clients and those of my learned friend Mr Wills, really are in an entirely different camp, in my submission.  One has a situation here where they may indeed be criticised, and I think Mr Hewitt may have criticised them for this, for saying too much rather than too little.  They've, in my submission, really made an attempt to say, look, these are the terrible things that we've been involved in, and they stretch over a long period of time, and we're now ashamed of them and we seek forgiveness for them from the communities concerned, and we seek amnesty for them from the Committee. ...(intervention)",

            "Thank you, thank you Mr Chairperson, I won't then dwell on that.  I would like, though, just to make, in a way to take us out once again from this sorry morass of murder and mayhem that we're in, to make one reference again, and I've said again I'm not an historian, but to make one reference again to what was said by Simon Wisenthal who was a well known Nazi war crimes prosecutor, and had spent much time in concentration camps in Nazi Germany during the second world war, and he was in a concentration camp when the war ended.  And he and his colleagues were emaciated and had no strength, and they invariably, they had to stay for some time in the camp, at least a few weeks afterwards, to try and recover before they could make arrangements to go to other places.  And the comment he made in his book, Justice not Vengeance, is particularly telling, and it was a comment about the local civilians who had really, in effect, been supportive of or complicit with the Nazi war machinery, and that they then, after the war, came to the concentration camp to see the people who were held there, and made the claim that they did not know what was going on, and they tried to really reduce themselves, or remove themselves, from the conflict.  And the quote is very short.  What Wisenthal says is, he says, \"...for the first time in my life I saw what enormous cowards these people were.  How instead of dealing with their guilt they tried to deny it, to suppress it insofar that in the end they couldn't see it themselves.  We didn't feel like talking to these people but we realised one thing, that the Germans and the Austrians would not simply acknowledge with shame what we had experienced, they would dispute it.\"  And as the Chairperson has indicated, the case of the applicants here today is really quite different.  They're not coming and disputing an involvement, quite contrary.\n\tWhat I have sought to do this, from page 17 onwards, and dealing with the question of acts associated with a political objective, what I've sought to do is to try and categorise some of the different acts and activities that the applicants have been involved in in different ways.  \n\tThe first category there is the assassination of identified targets, and those are in a sense easier for the Committee to deal with.  Questions have been raised as to whether the particular targets in some cases were political targets, and that's a matter that can be debated, but examples are, as I've said there, the murder of Zazi Khuzwayo, the attempted murder of Pearl Tshabalala.  And there are many others I can refer to, the murder of Nagtval Khumalo, that's Dlamini incident eight, the murder of Natie Gumede, Dlamini incident 11, the murder of April Khayiwe, Dlamini incident 12, the attempted murder of Welcome Ntumkulu, Dlamini incident 15, the murder of Mrs Thaba, that's Khumalo incident eight.  The numbers I'm referring to of course are the numbers in the schedules.\n\tIn each of these cases the targets were identified as being prominent members of the ANC or UDF or of playing a significant role in the conflict on the other side.  Arguments may be raised well that perhaps those people weren't, or perhaps insufficient double checking was done to ensure that they were prominent members, but on my submission there's no credible suggestion on the evidence before the Committee, that the belief the applicants had that those were prominent people, that did need to be murdered, or were within their instructions to murder, or assassinate, there's no criminal suggestion that they didn't bona fide believe them to be so.\n\tIf we deal with the case of Zazi Khuzwayo, for example, it was suggested, or an attempt was made in cross-examination to suggest that perhaps this was just an attempt by Samuel Jamile to eradicate one of his business opponents as opposed to political opponent, and thereby secure a business advantage in Claremont, and in that sense it wasn't a political assassination.  \nNow in the first place I would submit that it's clear that Zazi Khuzwayo did play a prominent political role in Claremont.  That's been detailed in the amnesty application of Mr Hlope, where Mr Hlope if I remember correctly was granted amnesty in respect of that murder.  It's been detailed, for example, by his lordship Mr Justice Hurt, in the case of the State v Mshengu, and others, where Pumulani Mshengu Bengu and Thlangani Pani Jamile were accused of the murder of Zazi Khuzwayo, and Mr Justice Hurt detailed there the political background to that murder, and that one of the main problems that faced the State there, I beg the Committee to bear with me but I've got the wrong, ...(intervention)",

Indeed, that is the starting point, insofar as any of the other documentary  reference are concerned, those are only corroboratory, and that, but that they are public documents and in that sense can be placed before you.  The other amnesty decisions and the decision of Mr Justice Hurt and so on.  But in Zazi Khuzwayo's case, yes indeed the evidence before the Committee is that he was a prominent political leader in Claremont.  The problem that he represented for the IFP is that he was resisting, or leading the resistance to the incorporation of Claremont into KwaZulu and played a prominent role in that respect, and he was clearly a political opponent of Mr Jamile and indeed of the IFP in the area as a whole.  And the IFP was weak in Claremont at the time.  We know that from the evidence of Mr Luthuli and Mr Khumalo who was also involved in that hit.\n\tBut in any event, even if Jamile's motives were that Mr Khuzwayo was a business opponent and should be eliminated on that basis, there's no suggestion that in the minds of Luthuli and Khumalo, who were involved in this murder, that they thought that their involvement was on the basis of him being a business opponent to Jamile.  They thought that they were pursuing a political hit against a prominent ANC or UDF community leader, and that's what they were involved with.  And the same goes, my submission, in the case of Pearl Tshabalala, notwithstanding that she was a business person in Claremont.  She was clearly a leading political figure in Claremont, and a political figure in the opposition, and there's certainly no evidence before the Committee to suggest that her businesses were the same of Jamile's and that they were in conflict in some way, or in opposition to one another in any way, in fact and very similar explanations in respect of each of the other targeted assassinations that I've referred to.",

And one had for example the Clewer(?) incident, where Luthuli and others were travelling in a car, some pedestrians said something insulting about Inkatha recognising the car, and that knowing that it was a car associated with Mr Jamile, and consequently Inkatha, and they stopped, and on Luthuli's instructions they went and they fired into the pedestrians.

Well, let me put it like this, it was in my submission, within his overall authority and objective to create terror, to shoot ANC supporting people and so on.  But in, the suggestion has been made, this specific incident may have been merely an angry outburst, and the way in which Luthuli described it on one occasion under cross-examination by Mr Hewitt, this is at page 153 of the record, towards the foot of the page, he was asked\n\"...Now can you explain to this Committee what possible political objective you could be achieving for your masters, for your party, by doing that\"\nand the incident referred to is the Clewer incident.  And Mr Luthuli said:\n\"...I will explain that in Claremont the IFP no longer existed.  Mr Jamile wanted by all means that he IFP's strength should be clear and be evident at Claremont.  This group of people and this remark that you are talking about from the IFP side, the person who makes this remark provokes the IFP, was is showing the people that he is with that here is somebody belonging to the other side, something must be done to him. Therefore, what happened at this incident was to show that he IFP at Claremont is there.  Such remarks shouldn't be used anyhow.  That was helping Jamile at Claremont.\"\nAnd I don't deny that, or don't seek to deny that there may have been some anger or some level of insult being felt, but this falls within what Luthuli has described, if anything, as retaliation rather than revenge.  And the Members of the Committee will recall that that was a distinction that was drawn by him.  Revenge, he said, would be where if his brother was killed and he felt the need to revenge that death.  But retaliation he put very much in a political context.  Someone attacks us, we must go and attack them.  It's a means of defence, it's a means of showing that we're not vulnerable to such attacks, that we have some strength, and it may indeed be done in anger but that doesn't put it within the category in the Act of spite, of motive of spite for example, it doesn't remove it from the realm of being an act with a political objective.",

That the rewards, such as they were, can be equally consistent with the objective being a political objective to eradicate the ANC in the area, to assert the IFP's presence, to try and further their campaign for the incorporation of Claremont into KwaZulu, and so on.  That Jamile was a political leader inasmuch as he had businesses, he was a political leader, he was a member of the KwaZulu legislative assembly, he was later a cabinet minister in KwaZulu and he had political objectives.  And the fact that he rewarded people for assisting him in his political objectives is not inconsistent, and not only consistent with a business or eradication of business opponents kind of objective.  That would be my answer and my submission in that regard.\n\tSome of the justifications and explanations in regard to these incidents and attacks also occur in the cross-examination by my learned friend Mr Wills of Mr Luthuli.  And indeed by the Members of the Committee.  The cross-references, much of the  cross-referencing is already in the schedules, but that, those refer on the whole to evidence in chief rather than the cross-examination, but it is there and in my submission falls into those particular, particular incidents, or particular justifications.\n\tNow, the Honourable Member Ms Khampepe has pointed out to me that in the first instance the most reliable place to find answers in this case is the record of this case, rather in other cases, and I'm equally mindful that in a particular case the Honourable Member gave a dissenting opinion or decision, but in a sense, the amnesty decision in the case of those who were involved on the attack, the AWB attack on a bus, which I think was on its way to Inanda, if I remember correctly, falls into a like kind of category.

I don't come before the Committee to argue in support of those decisions, but only to suggest that those decisions do offer some support to amnesty being granted in respect of the incidents which fall into this category here, of so called random attacks, or attacks on innocent or unidentified civilians but nevertheless pursuant to an overall political objective or motive as I've suggested.  I appreciate of course that in the case of the AWB bus attack there's some very different considerations as well, if anything that case is much worse.  It's far more retaliatory.

And they don't offer assistance because this Act is not seeking to, it's not seeking to question the morality of the tactic that were employed, which, in my understanding, the international conventions seek to do.  They seek to set an international standard of morality, which says there will be warfare in our world, unfortunate as it is, now let's all agree that we'll conduct warfare within certain moral boundaries, and that isn't something which this Act requires to be done.  There are very specific requirements that need to be met and if those are met then amnesty, in my submission, has to be granted.  If they're not met, then it has to be refused.\n\tBy just way of example, and I, this will be my last reference, I hope not to bore the Committee with references to the second world war, but by way of example, before the second world war the United Kingdom participating in the discussions which led to the Geneva Convention, originally had the position that there should be no bombing at all, not even of, this is air bombing, not even of oil installations or military factories or whatever.  That position was then abandoned in recognition that there will be bombing, but at the beginning of the war the bombing that was embarked upon was only on so called military targets.  By the end of the war the position had shifted and it was bombing for military objectives on civilian targets.  And I raise that only because the circumstances there determined for the people involved the particular tactics that they would employ, and indeed there's severe debate about the morality of some of those tactics, and in this case there may be less debate about the morality only because some of these attacks are so clearly immoral or morally unjustifiable.

So really, in my submission is that I'm on far more solid ground today in relation to these sort incidents. ...(intervention)",

            "(Cont)\n\t...(tape blank) in addition to which Mr Luthuli and then Mr Mbambo in particular, and some of the other applicants too, discussed really what they saw as the two faces, the private and the public face, to IFP policy.  And the public face being one which said, we're a peaceful organisation, we embark only upon peaceful tactics and objectives.  But the private face, the one being propagated from the meetings of the cabinet of the KwaZulu homeland through to public meetings, mass meetings, was one of anger and of revenge and of attack, and that was the very real experience of the applicants in the way in which they explained it to the Committee, that public and private face.\n\tAnd so their understanding is that that was the policy that was being embarked upon and they had it confirmed to them in so many ways.  In addition to which it was confirmed to them inasmuch as they were hidden and protected when the arm of the law was able to reach out to them.  So in instances where Mr Khumalo was arrested, where Mr Dlamini was arrested, he was whisked out of hospital where he had been lying with his leg up in a sling and he was pulled out of hospital and taken away in a car and then hidden for a long period of time in different places including in Venda and in the Mkuzi camp.\n\tThe same with Mr Khumalo when it appeared the police were on his trail, in fact on the one occasion he was arrested and bail was paid, and then he was hidden away and instructed not to go back.  And those activities, in hiding and protecting the applicants from the law, in those instances, that was done by senior members in the IFP itself and in the KwaZulu police, and that gives credence to their claim that this was the policy and this was how they understood the policy to be, that these are the things they should be doing.\nMr Dlamini in particular makes really an impassioned statement towards the end of his evidence in, I think it was his evidence at Mpumalanga and it also happens to be quoted in the Truth Commission final report, where he talks about the betrayal that he felt that all these years he did al this, he did so much for his organisation, and he did what he was trained to do, and he did what he was instructed to do and he really sacrificed so much, and now at the eleventh hour he's deserted, and those people who had told him that he should do these things and those people who had trained him to do these things are now denying it, and denying any involvement, and denying that he was acting on any instructions.\n\tAnd indeed my submission is that the evidence both from here, from these proceedings, and indeed in other proceedings and elsewhere, is quite clear that there was indeed that private face of fighting a war, and a particularly ruthless war at that.\nAnother category of incident would be that of defending individuals and property.  Now this would seem to me to be relative uncontroversial.  That there're incidences, Mr Dlamini's incidences two and three, Mr Khumalo's incident five, where really the applicants were involved in defending people and property.  Dlamini two and three is where he was involved in shooting a policeman where he was guarding a house and they came under fire and they retaliated, and he found he had shot a policeman, and they subsequently discovered that the policemen and themselves considered themselves to be on the same side, but nevertheless he had shot that policeman.  Three was the defence of Mgwabe's house at Natingi, and Mr Khumalo's incident five is that same attack at Natingi.  And there, as I've said, relatively uncontroversial, what's been done there was defending from attack and that that involved itself a certain amount of attack but in essence it would be what one could described as a defensive operation.\n\tAnd a final category which I've identified there, of course these are my own categorisations, is that of enforcing allegiances to chiefs and to the party, being the IFP.  And Mr Luthuli in particular deals with this in his affidavit from page 253 onwards, in paragraph 16, and he talks about the strategies that were employed in the rural areas, in particular in the area out towards Elandskop, Gezubuso and beyond, the other side of Edendale, of trying to ensure that the chiefs who may have been wavering in their support for the IFP were encouraged to strengthen that support, and also ensuring that the people in those areas supported the IFP supporting chiefs, and it included seizing cattle and so on.  Mr Luthuli was not involved in those things himself, but he's talking about what was going on.\nThere is the one, or perhaps more controversial incident than others, of the murder of Natie Gumede in which Mr Dlamini was involved.  \n\tNow Mr Wills will deal in more detail with this because it involves also Mr Hlongwane and Mr Mbambo, but I'm briefed of course today to speak on Mr Dlamini's behalf, as to his involvement, and there was a suggestion in cross-examination that this hit had something to do with a motor vehicle or a charge about a motor vehicle, and so on.  But it's quite clear from Mr Dlamini's evidence that insofar as he was aware, and insofar as he was concerned, this was another one of the political hits and he was instructed that this what, this was an ANC supporting person who needed to be eliminated, and he really, as a, as more of a foot soldier than any of the others in this hearing, went along and did what he was instructed to do, and if there was anything about a car or something like that he didn't know anything about it, and he in my submission held the bona fide belief that this was a political hit, and indeed as I submit it was, but I don't need to go that far on behalf of Mr Dlamini, I only need to go so far as to show what he thought that he was involved in, and whether or not he thought that was a reasonable belief, and indeed in the circumstances my submission it was.  They were involved in, on the same day, in identifying two people at the Eshowe hospital, a security guard and a nurse, that had to be eliminated for political reasons.  They decided not to carry out those hits on that day because there were too many police and so on around, and then they went off to find Natie Gumede and Mr Dlamini explains clearly in his evidence what he thought that that was about.\nSo that then deals, in my submission, ...(intervention)",

Are you saying then that the actual motivation behind the killings is completely separate from the taking of the video recorder?  So when they went into the house it was there for the clearance purposes, to attack them because it was an ANC or UDF area, and coming out the taking of the video recorder, although it is looting and theft and there is an element of personal gain, it's not linked to the reason why the inhabitants of the house were killed?

It may have been something en passant but we are looking for it and we'll come back to it.\n\tThat then takes me to the next eliminating consideration, as it were, in Section 20 sub 3, Roman two of the Act, which is the question of personal malice or spite.\n\tNow, as I've suggested in my heads there is no evidence of this.  Of course, I say there isn't even a suggestion of it.  Well in cross-examination there was a suggestion of it, and it came in particular in relation to the murder by Mr Khumalo of Mrs Xaba in Mpumalanga, and as Members of the Committee will recall, this was the case where he had, a particular target had been identified, it's Mr Khumalo's incident number eight, a particular target had been identified as supplying guns, I think it was, to ANC people in the area, and it was decided that Mrs Xaba being the target should be eliminated.  Mr Khumalo enlisted the support of Mr Musa Gqulu and early one morning they then followed her as she went towards work, and it was dark, and Mr Khumalo followed her, and as she was going up some steps he caught up to her and he trod heavily to attract her attention, he was about two and a half metres away, she turned round, and he shot her.  And the suggestion that was made in cross-examination, well that is evidence that really he was doing this not because she was a political target that needed to be eliminated, but because he enjoyed killing, or he was wanting to torture her because of his lust for killing.  Now the suggestion is there of course.  There's no suggestion thought that there was personal malice as between him and her, or personal ill will or spite.  It's not something which arises out of some other private as opposed to political feud, which has now been dressed up in political clothing.  The criticism, it seems to me, of Mr Khumalo in the circumstances, is that he was being inordinately callous, where he could have killed her without her knowing, he ensured that she did know.  His explanation for that, such as it was, was that he had a policy, a personal policy which he pursued, of not shooting people in the back.  \n\tThe murder of course, one way or another, was a brutal murder, but it was one, in my submission, which was clearly one with, associated with, a political objective.  There wasn't really besides this suggestion of a lust for killing, there was no, there's nothing more to show that it was out of personal spite or malice.

            "Yes, thank you Mr Chairperson. ...(inaudible)\n\tMembers of the Committee I act for four of what must be described as foot soldiers of the IFP's military machine, and persons who were primarily responsible for the actual killings on the ground.  Like Mr Stewart I have annexed to my Heads a list as Annexure A of all the matters, all the incidents, which the applicant whom I represent, in respect of which they apply for amnesty.  Obviously I think that it's clear to the Committee, its' very difficult to be specific about the offences, simply because of the lack of evidence as regards who the victims were and also because of the large time scale involved.  It's very difficult to give actual dates and link that up to any event at any particular place, but be that as it may I still think it's important that we maintain our application for amnesty in respect of these matter, even 'though the details are somewhat vague, particularly in the light of developments that it appears that in respect of people who haven't applied there is going to be an attempt by the Department of Justice to prosecute those persons.  And I think in the circumstances it would be extremely unfair to these applicants, who I submit are some of the few that have taken the Commission and the Committee, I say the Commission and the Committee, both the Human Rights Violations Committee and the Amnesty Committee, in to their confidence to such an extent.  \n\tI think rather than just following my Heads I'd like to just deal with the issue which is last in my Heads, and that is the issue of full disclosure.  I know it's not really a big issue in this case.  I just want to make the point that even 'though the person whom I represent are in gaol for certain offences, they represent a small proportion, or a small amount, of the acts in which they were involved.  And in fact in the majority of incidents no-one would have known about the fact that these incidents had taken place, had it not been for the applicants themselves coming forward.  So clearly one cannot ascribe the fact that they're in prison to their application to, or their application for amnesty.  In fact the converse is true.  I'm not sure if it's part of the evidence, I think it did come out in one of the applicant's evidence, that they made the revelations to the Goldstone Commission well before this Act was published, and they've been helping the State with investigations since late 1993 or early 94.\n\tI've divided the argument up into geographical areas, but first of all I think it's important to look at the context, and this is the overall context, which in my submission, applies to all the incidents in all the areas at all times.  The first, and I think most important thing, is the simple fact that all of the members were part of a military operation which Inkatha had set up with the express purpose of, I think in Luthuli's words, eliminating the ANC in KwaZulu Natal.  \tNow it is my submission that every act that was committed by the applicants who I represent, was associated with that objective.  It's clear that, from Luthuli's evidence, that Inkatha had decided to form an armed wing to fight the ANC.  My case is slightly different to that of Mr Stewart's, because from the fact that the applicants who I represent are in fact foot soldiers, it's my submission that they had the general instruction to carry out these attacks from people in higher authority, and it's clear from Mr Luthuli's evidence, and specifically my cross-examination of Mr Luthuli, that he knew more or less what each of these applicants were doing.  Possibly not with each specific incident, but clearly their main purpose of, as I say, eliminating the UDF was well known to him and he supported them.",

            "Not to my knowledge, and I submit to be corrected because there is a voluminous, there's literally tens of incidents, but I've divided the issue up in my Heads to specific incidents of orders, where like Mr Stewart I've referred those to, as you'll see in page 9 of my Heads, identification and elimination of specific targets relating to the Izingolweni matters, and there I've detailed where they got the orders from and what's that about.\n\tBut then the issue, the second issue that I deal with, and I'll get to, and I think I need to elaborate slightly on what Mr Stewart has said, relates to the, what I term the so called indiscriminate attacks, and I think in that category there are certain cases where it may be submitted, in my submission without merit, that they were acting outside the mandate of their superiors.  \tBut if I could just, with respect Mr Chairperson, just focus for a short while on the importance of the membership of this military machine and its implications on the applicants.  Because it's my submission that it's this very membership, without, if they didn't have this membership they wouldn't have been in the position they were, and obviously also the dehumanising effect of that, on each of the applicants, I think must be taken into consideration.  Particularly in relation to applicant seven, Hlongwane, who was involved in horrendous direct conflicts from a very young age.  And it could be argued with merit that somebody who finds himself in that position would not be able to be discerning in his later life, and that I think is borne out with his subsequent history.\n\tThere's also the division, as I see it, in the IFP military structures.  On the one hand you've got people like Mkhize and Luthuli and Dlamini, who got involved, and Mbambo, who got involved in formal hit squad structures, and later on Hlongwane joined, but I think there's also an important aspect of just youth getting involved through informal structures and being controlled specifically by local people on the ground, particularly the people in Hammarsdale, Mr Mkehle was a dominant influence in regard to Hlongwane, and because the relationship was quite a loose military relationship, there were just broad instructions given to attack the ANC and the UDF, and obviously if that is the case, there would be a wide range of activities which possibly might not be sanctioned other than by a broad instruction.\n\tAnother aspect which Mr Stewart has referred to briefly, which I concentrate on and I think is important, is at page 5 of my Heads, and it's what I've titled the territorial dynamics of the conflict.  It's a unique feature of the Natal violence, in my submission, that the conflict relates so directly to territory, and the whole of the conflict was about dominance of particular geographical areas, to the extent, as I say in my heads, that one could more or less rely on the fact of if one lived in a particular area than one would be a member of the political party that was dominant in that area.  This aspect of the conflict I submit is important particularly when one looks at what might, had it not been for that characteristic, be considered indiscriminate attacks.\nI think the evidence of Hlongwane in the Hammarsdale record, is pertinent in this regard.  He, as a young man, was under the impression that it was his, it was for him to fulfil the objectives of his organisation, that the UDF should not exist and not be able to govern Mpumalanga.  \n\"...We were supposed to eliminate the UDF, everybody, everybody belonging to the UDF was supposed to be eliminated at the time.\"\nLuthuli also comments on this, that it would be assumed that because in an area there are certain people who belong to a certain political organisation, which is controlled by a certain organisation, those people would have to be killed.  And I think this relationship which the foot soldiers had with  their superiors who had this attitude, clearly gave them the distinct impression that it was their party's policy to adopt this approach, and it was part of the policy of the IFP military to take, to attack anybody in an ANC area.",

            "I would go so far as to say it was policy, in the sense that it relates to what Mr Stewart and what Mr Luthuli brought out as regards the public and the private face of the Inkatha's tactics.  I submit it was used so commonly that what might have been a practice certainly developed at least, at the very least, in the minds of the applicants, to be a policy of the organisation.  And from a very young age Inkatha youth, particularly Hlongwane were, and applicant four Ndlovu, taught that you had to be a member of Inkatha to live in this area.  And being a loyal member of Inkatha you had to, you had no choice, you had to attend at camps, you had to obey the instructions of military commanders, and you had to chase the ANC out, or the UDF out of the area.  So I'd submit it was a policy.\n\tIn regard to this, going to page 7 of my Heads, in view of this territorial, this territorial nature of the conflict, and in view of the fact that all the applicant who I represent were involved in this military attack, it's my submission that all the applicant believed, on reasonable grounds, that they were acting within the course of their duties, or with express or implied authority as IFP hit men.  And I submit that the evidence of Luthuli reinforces this point.\nAnother important aspect is the specific hit squad that was set up at Izingolweni dealing with Izingolweni matters.  Here what was important was that applicant five was called to Ulundi, spoken to by very senior IFP people, and asked him if he'd be capable, if he, well he was ordered in fact, to set up a hit squad.  He then was given the task to recruit other people and he was informed how things would basically operate.  He appointed first of all applicant five Mbambo, and then later on Hlongwane was sent on instructions by Luthuli to join, and so to was Dlamini, applicant three, to join in.  The significance of that, from my point of view, from the evidence it can be seen, is that at least in relation to those people acting below Mkhize, and in every event wherein Mkhize were involved, they had orders from Mkhize, and Mkhize obviously got his orders in the main from Captain Langeni.  And the Committee Members will recall the main person who was communicating with Ulundi, and in fact with the local IFP leadership whose role was mainly to identify targets, was in fact Mkhize, and to a lesser extent, at least with the local leadership, was Mbambo, who in fact, when Mkhize was available, took over for a short period as the leader of the hit squad.\n\tOn page 8 I refer to the modus operandi, the identification and  elimination of specific targets, and the indiscriminate attacks on ANC areas and persons.  The only issue, I think that it would waste the Committee's time for me to go through the actual incidents, I've documented them here in relation to Izingolweni, the only thing that I want to touch on is the so called what I've termed the cross fire cases.  \tYou will recall that there were a number of incidents where, for example in the murder of Sergeant Dlamini, Sergeant Khumalo, where Mr Mabiko was killed.  You'll also recall the incident where there was an attempt on Mr Ntimkulu's life, and it turned out that there were in fact women in the car, and Mr Ntimkulu was nowhere to be found.  It's my submission in those incidents that the motivation was still political in the sense that they went out to perform those deeds, and secondly that because the deeds in the main occurred within the context of this territorial conflict, that they were relatively certain in any event that the persons found in those areas would be ANC supporting.  And so in a sense the two types of attacks dovetailed, and weren't outside what the policy of the military strategy was.\n\tWhat's also important from, from my clients' point of view, is the fact that they invariably reported back the incidents to, usually in the case of Mr Mkhize to Ulundi, and always to the local leadership in Empangeni, usually either to the, to Mr Bhiela or Mrs Umbuyazi.\nMr Stewart referred to the issue of the kidnapping and murder of Natie Gumede.  Clearly from the, the evidence suggests and it's not contested in any way, was that there was a direct instruction given at a meeting in Ulundi by Prince Gideon Zulu whose a very senior person within the IFP, that this person should be eliminated.  Not only did he give the order but he also ordered his subordinate, a Mr Naiwozi to organise a car from the chief minister's department, and the car was utilised, and after the attack it was, after the execution of the order, a report back was made.  There was, I remember at the trial, and also the suggestion in cross-examination that  there might have been an ulterior motive particularly from Mbambo, relating to the stealing of a car, but on balance the evidence clearly weighs in favour of the applicants that that was in fact no the motivation.  \n\tYou will recall that a considerable time was spent in checking up the deeds and the activities of Gumede, before the decision was taken to kill him.  In fact Mkhize and Mbambo conducted certain investigations and only after they were satisfied that this was in fact an ANC plot, when I say they were satisfied within their own minds that this was an ANC plot to have Mr Mbambo, who was well know in Izingolweni at the time for what he was doing, taken off the streets, and it was for that reason ...(intervention)",

His response to that was, knowing that he hadn't been involved in this, was that he was going to investigate this, and he reported this to his superiors.  But, with respect, that aspect of the events, pales into insignificance because the real reason why, in any event, why Natie Gumede, the decision was taken to kill Natie Gumede, and I believe the real reason which, why Gideon Zulu took the decision, was because had Mbambo got into any trouble there was a possibility that the activities of this hit squad could have been revealed, and it was just too dangerous.  This hit squad was operating very effectively, it was facilitating the aim of clearing Izingolweni of ANC and causing havoc in what was a pretty strong ANC area at the time, and that process wasn't going to be disturbed under any circumstances.

            "Thank you Ms Committee Member.  My submission in this regard would be that had that been the case, the applicant was fully armed with a whole arsenal of weapons, which one can see at the final stages of my argument, and he could have quite easily taken that person out completely, without referring the matter to anybody else.  Instead he took the matter to his commander, Mr Mkhize, he disclosed the problem to Mr Mkhize, but even more than that the matter was raised with Gideon Zulu and others at a meeting at Ulundi.  Now there would have been no necessity for that, in my submission, had there, had he just wanted to kill Gumede for the purpose of trying to cover things up.  What I think is the probably is in fact what Mr Mbambo suggests, is that he honestly felt that his was a ploy of the ANC to get him off the streets in Izingolweni, and I think if one considers the evidence in totality, particularly the issue of how the KwaZulu policemen in Izingolweni were investigating the crimes of their colleagues, covering up evidence, and the fact that the ANC had no recourse to the police station, one can understand that these types of desperate measures or different tactics to get rid of a person, would ensue.  For example, there's no motor vehicle theft unit in Izingolweni with the KwaZulu police.  One would have to go to the South African police to get that sort of thing investigated.  That's the first thing.\n\tAnd secondly the ANC had lost all faith in reporting incidents to that police station, because there was no success in investigating the issues.  And that in itself would make it far easier for Mbambo to have killed Gumede.  Because he could have killed Gumede and the matter simply wouldn't have been investigated, like the hundreds of other issues that weren't investigated.\n\tI submit as well in the totality of the evidence, I mean you're touching on the issue of personal gain, there is not one iota of evidence where any of the applicants whom I represent got anything for anything that they did, other than the salaries that they got as policemen.\nNow, the only, turning to the incidents of what I've loosely referred to as the indiscriminate attacks, and I use the word indiscriminate specifically in the context that the victims were not identifiably, but the attacks were discriminate in the sense that they were directed against either ANC persons or ANC areas.  But referring to that was what I considered to be quite a seminal event in the history of Izingolweni, and that was the incident where the IFP had a rally in February 1992 at the Izingolweni station, stadium, and Prince Gideon Zulu was due to address that rally, and it was disrupted by the ANC to the extent that Prince Gideon Zulu couldn't deliver his speech as he intended.  And from that point on, right in the presence of Mbabmo and later at a meeting called at Izingolweni specifically to discuss that problem, Gideon Zulu issued the instructions to the effect that \"...we must do to the ANC what they are doing to us.\"  And by that he was referring specifically to these attacks on ANC busses and the like in areas without specifically targeting people.  And that was seminal in the sense that it was only after that that the applicants who I represent, should I say the applicants who'd only been operating in Izingolweni, got involved in that sort of violence.",

But clearly in regard to Mkhize and Mbambo who only really got involved in these activities in Izingolweni, that was clearly the case.  But Gideon Zulu went further than that, and this is confirmed in Luthuli's evidence, because Luthuli confirmed that whilst Luthuli wasn't at the meeting at Hlalankahle hall when this change of policy was communicated to the local people, Luthuli commented that he met with Gideon Zulu at a later stage, at Ulundi, where Zulu indicated to Luthuli that this change of police had occurred.  And that's documented I think in the statement of, I've got the reference somewhere in my argument and I can find it.\n\tThere's an enormous amount of these so called indiscriminate attacks, and I don't intend to deal with each of them, I want to deal with them quite broadly, and I've listed them at page 14.  These, once these attacks started, there were more specific reasons given for them at certain stages.  You will recall that there was the incident of when some of the IFP hit, some of the IFP operative in Izingolweni were arrested as a result of an attack on the ANC leader Beki Ntuli's home.  They went to Court and there was a bail hearing.  The ANC leader Willis Mkunu gave evidence to the effect that, \n\"... since these people have been arrested the violence in Izingolweni has dropped.\"\nAnd then there was a meeting between Bhiela, Mrs Umbuyazi and the so called lawyer Gabela, that in order to persuade the Magistrate otherwise, the hit squads should be activated, and on that particular evening a lot of havoc was, they certainly did operate in Izingolweni.\n\tI think as well on that level, referring back to Gideon Zulu, there was that level of pride.  The evidence sort of indicated when Zulu was so furious about this attack, that he accused these well trained soldiers of not being able to do their jobs.  In fact it was the only time, in my going through the evidence of this time, that they were reprimanded.  They were never reprimanded for killing people.  I mean sorry, the only time they were reprimanded was for not killing people.  They were never disciplined for killing the wrong person or going, or doing too much in that regard, and I think that's quite an important point.",

The main import of the application in respect of the rape, or my main argument, concerns the brutality of the violence and the experience of what applicant seven had been through up until that point in time.  He had effectively been taught to treat enemies as dogs, without having any compassion for their humanity whatsoever.  The evidence of Luthuli concerning his problems when he first arrived in Mpumalanga, about the undisciplined nature of the violence, is also pertinent in this regard.  You will recall that Ntuli went in and there were two camps.  There was one person who wanted to speak, to negotiate problems through, negotiate the conflict through peaceful means, and there was Mkehle who was Hlongwane's commander, who preferred the violent means.  And in describing how these people operated, Luthuli went as far as saying that because the person operating under Mkehle were so treacherous and bad and brutal, that people were moving out of the IFP areas into the ANC areas because they didn't want anything to do with it.  And I think Luthuli's words was that he wanted, one of his purposes of coming to Mpumalanga was to rebuild the organisation because of the serious indiscipline that he found there.\n\tNow should that be the case, and I submit there is nothing to counter it in the evidence, then clearly the implication is that those persons acting under Mkehle basically did what they wanted without any guidance whatsoever in regard to terrorising the community.  And in those circumstances, the extremes that they took to eliminate all opposition, went to levels which can only be described as horrific.  \n\tThe two girls were not seen as women, they were seen as ANC spies, and the order that Hlongwane got from Mkehle was brutal in the extreme.  When he had captured the girls Mkehle indicated to him that he must cut their throats and take a cloths and wipe some blood off each of their throats and return the bloodstained cloth to him so that he could use this for muti.  In his evidence Hlongwane said that he must do something so terrible to these girls that it will serve as an indication to other people, other girls specifically, that they should not come into the area to spy.  And it's in those circumstances that that rape occurred.  \n\tFirst of all had there not been the perception that these girls were spying, Hlongwane wouldn't have gone to get them.  He in fact was called away to deal with the issue, and it is my submission that this rape was simply another example of the extreme brutality which was occurring at the time.  Hlongwane also gives evidence to the effect that it was a practice that was used, and nobody disputed this despite the representation of the victims here, that it was, he mentions the name of a particular IFP woman who was found killed and raped on one occasion, and his evidence was to the effect that this rape occurred on both sides.  And that is corroborated by what Luthuli says when he gets to Mpumalanga.  Luthuli comments at page 289 of the bundle, that the Inkatha youth simply attacked houses on the slightest suspicion.  People were robbed, girls were raped, and people were murdered.  In his testimony applicant one saw his role to clean up the IFP, which was involved, the IFP was involved in killing, kidnapping, rape, stealing, burning and shooting and killing people in broad daylight.\n\tNow my submission is obviously Mkehle would have know that this was going on if Luthuli who was a recent, or I shouldn't say recent, but he'd come to the area after a long absence.  One would expect, Luthuli found it out almost immediately, so Mkehle must have know that this was going on, and no steps were taken whatsoever to stop this type of activity.",

            "(Cont)\n\tSorry, to put it on record, the applicant's age at the time of the rape incident was 16 years.  Also, getting back to the question that was raised by Committee Member Judge Khampepe, the luring of Sikanye to the night vigil, clearly the Committee Member's recollection of events was more accurate than mine.  The incident, the incident occurred in that Thulani, the order was given by Mkehle to kill Thulani in order to lure Sikanye who was the target to the night vigil, and it was, he was going to be killed there.  He didn't come to the night vigil.  Then the younger brother was killed, the name of isn't on record and the applicant doesn't know the name to this day.  And he was cross-examined and the reason for the killing wasn't to lure the person, it was mainly just an attack on him, being a person from a UDF family in the general violence at the time.  So my submission is, is that that takes it out of the issue of proportionality.  \n\tIf there's anything further I'll move on.  The pages reference there, this incident is discussed page 159 of the Hammarsdale, sorry let me just check that, 159 to 169 is when it was discussed on the record.  It's the Hammarsdale volume.  And just in answer to a question, just to finalise that issue to Honourable Judge Khampepe, the applicant was asked:\n\"...Are you saying that you killed Hlongwane's younger brother because he was Sikanye's brother, or was it because he was a member of the UDF?  Which of the two?  I just need clarification.\"\nThe answer being:\n\"...It was both, he was a member of the UDF and he was also Sikanye's brother.\"\nI submit that that would form part of the sort of general attacks on the opposition.  Thank you.\nI now want to turn to deal with the Ermelo matters, and I'm going to deal with these very briefly in my argument.  They commence at page 18 of my Heads, and they're listed in my Annexure A I think in section 3.  I don't intend going through every incident, basically what needs to be emphasised here is the way, or the circumstances surrounding the applicant's deployment in Ermelo.  \n\tYou will recall that he was actually removed from the police as a special constable, because the South African police were searching for him in relation to the rape issue which we discussed.  And he was taken, he fled to Ulundi together with his co-accused and they were sent back to get clothing.  In the process his co-accused got caught and then Hlongwane was hid for a while in the Ulundi environs.  It was at that stage that, I think at one of the camps, the Black Cats from Ermelo, basically the IFP youth from Ermelo, came and he met them there, and then he was given basically a deployment order by the first applicant, Luthuli, to go to Ermelo, specifically because the Black Cats were losing the war and the ANC were creating problems for organisation in that area.  The similar structure existed in that he was told to report to the mayor of Dargle a Mr Noah, and he met this person at an agreed place.  This person provided food and shelter and in fact, together with other IFP persons in the area, provided him with the, what he described as being the tools that he required for, to, satisfy his mission or to complete his mission there.  And as the evidence indicates he was very successful in this regard, and certainly directed a number of attacks against the opposition which were quite successful.  \n\tI, it's my submission that in relation to all these attacks they were committed strictly within the framework of the military tactics employed by the IFP against the ANC and UDF at the time, and further that in relation to all of these incidents he has fully disclosed the circumstances surrounding them.  Again it's, I think it's useful to emphasise that in most of these instances, he hasn't been prosecuted, and in fact nobody would have known his involvement had it not been for him coming to the fore.  Further, his sincerity in approaching matters this way is shown by the fact that he has acted for the State as a State witness and assisted with investigations, and also as Mr Stewart had indicated earlier, his contrition and his full disclosure has led to him being, his apology being accepted by the community in Ermelo.",

            "Yes, and he did that task.  I mean, clearly in respect of the Ermelo, he was known to be Zulu speaking.  He got the reputation of being a KwaZulu policeman there.  He didn't obviously know Ermelo at all, so had it not been for the local IFP leadership pointing people out, he wouldn't have known what to do.  They provided him with cover, they provided him with transport, they provided him with arms and ammunition and they pointed out the targets.  And basically he was more or less their fire power and that was about it.\nJust the only other incident that I want to refer to that occurred within the Mpumalanga province's jurisdiction, is the issue of the murder of Japie Teledi, which involved applicants five and seven.  It involved applicant five only in a very minor respect in that he was originally involved in a conspiracy together with applicant five, to kill Japie Teledi, but for reasons that Japie Teledi was not in Bushbuckridge at the time, that mission was aborted.  You will recall that the evidence was to the effect that later after the death of applicant five's, that Mbambo's, mentor, Siphiwe Ungayani, his co-accused in that trial, Wiseman Ngxongo, came to Izingolweni and the mission again was revisited and eventually it was successful.  \n\tThere was some controversy raised by initially Mr Hewitt and later on by Committee Member Judge Khampepe, regarding the fact that in the application Mbambo had not stated the involvement of Mrs Umbuyazi, and he'd only said that in evidence, the implication being that this was a, sort of a post event fabrication.  I'm able to refer the Committee to the judgment which I didn't have available at that time, but  I can state that the judgment in the matter where Mbambo was convicted was handed down by his lordship I think Mr de Klerk on the 22nd of June 1996.  I'm just going to check that date.  Yes, sorry, the 22nd of July 1996, and it was on that date that Mbambo appeared in Court and he pleaded guilty to this charge and he explained in mitigation the circumstances surrounding the killing, and the mitigation is recorded in the amnesty application of his co-accused, Mondli Wiseman Ngxongo, my pronunciation is bad but the spelling is N G X O N G O, and the amnesty reference number is AM4034/96.  34 of 96.  \n\tNow you will see from the affidavits in respect of this matter that they were only signed in December of 96, so it is clear that before the application was signed, Mbambo had already testified to the effect that Mrs Umbuyazi was involved in these matters, and essentially, to say ...(intervention)",

            "MR WILLS",
            "Yes, exactly.  In fact, the evidence in mitigation that is transcribed, follows almost to the letter of the mitigation, or sorry of the evidence, that was led before this Commission, the viva voce evidence.  And it's my submission that this lends credence to Mr Mbambo when he indicated in answer to those questions, that he did indicate this in Court and that there was no mala fides or an attempt to not disclose the facts on his part.\n\tRegarding that murder, clearly, taking into account and on the basis that Mrs Umbuyazi was involved and had ordered the, or had sanctioned the attack, when basically the evidence is Wiseman Ngxongo came to Izingolweni, he found Mbambo, Mbambo together went with Ngxongo to Mrs Umbuyazi's house.  Mrs Umbuyazi then made a phone call to the IFP contact in Bushbuckridge or Mpumalanga, she spoke to, we think, the chairperson there, and then she came back off the phone and she said, you guys must go and, in a hurry, and perform this mission.  That is borne out in the transcript of the record in the criminal proceedings, and is reflected as I say at pages 58, 59 and 60 of the bundle that I mentioned earlier, that is amnesty, the Ngxongo matter 4034/96.\n\tI submit in those circumstances, again, the applicant has satisfied both the requirements of full disclosure and the fact that this act was an act committed, associated with a political objective.  Again, to emphasise this, the representative of Mr Tuledi's family, attorney Ntuli from Nelspruit, was present at the proceedings at Ermelo, and he made no suggestion that one, Tuledi was not an active member of the ANC, and secondly, that Tuledi was not involved in the smuggling of weapons for the IFP, for the ANC, as was alleged by initially Sipho Umviyani as being the reason why Tuledi had to die.  I submit that had that not been the case that, particularly in the light of the fact that that family was represented, would have brought to the attention of the Committee.  My submission obviously being that one must at the very least assume that Tuledi was an active ANC person and in that sense he was a legitimate target and an obstruction to the IFP operations in that region.\n\tTurning now to the Mandini matters.  On the completion of my Heads I realised that I should have actually placed these within the context of the Izingolweni matters because they occurred at the same time.  Again, these involve applicant seven, in the main, and to a lesser extent, applicant six.  The reason for this being that the prime mover of these operations, the evidence suggests, is the, is chief Mataba from the Inyoni district in northern Natal, which I think adjoins the Izingolweni town boundaries, it's in the Umtinzini district.  Now you will recall from the evidence and the statement of Mbambo, that chief Mataba was listed as one of the person who he regarded as being one of the hit squad commanders.  Basically what occurred was that chief Mataba, in the main, made certain requests of applicants six and seven, to perform certain deeds.  Should I rather be, sorry I withdraw that statement, he essentially ordered six and seven to take out certain people.  Amongst them a Cosatu bus driver, certain indunas who were allowing free political association areas, and a number of others.  \n\tNow not only did he enlist their assistance in these matters, he also provided most of the logistical requirements.  In fact in the, on the one occasion chief Mataba himself pointed out the house where the target lived, and on other instances he provided certain persons to do that for him.  But in all instances, his blue Toyota Cressida vehicle was used in the incidents.  I submit in that context these matters must be seen, the ones specifically ordered by Mataba, as being act with, associated with a political objective.\nThere are a number of other acts which are directed against what appear to be Cosatu individuals in the Sundumbili area.  These also relate back to chief Mataba's concerns.  And those that don't, I think there's two that don't, I cannot specifically ...(intervention)",

            "MR WILLS",
            "Yes.  Turning to the last incidents which I couldn't categorise geographically, in the main body of the evidence, there was the first incident of the murder of Bongani Ntombela in December 1991 at Imbali.  And this is the matter in respect of which applicant four, Mr Ndlovu, is seeking amnesty.  This you will recall is the matter where he was, as a KwaZulu policeman, was guarding MZ Khumalo's son's house in Izingolweni, and they were taking a walk down the street when they were insulted by a group of about 15 individuals, and then on the return to the house his colleague initially shot one of these individuals in the leg, and then the applicant finished him off by shooting him in the head, to use his words.\n\tHere he was cross-examined to an extent on the issue of how he recognised, by again Committee Member Judge Khampepe, on how he recognised this particular individual, and the suggestion, or the inference was, was that it was an indiscriminate killing rather than something that, or rather than him specifically retaliating to a specific individual who had in fact insulted him.  I submit in this case the political context of this is that the applicant was sent as an IFP constable to guard a house, and I think the evidence was to the extent that in particular section of Imbali there were only two IFP houses and so they had to be guarded quite, with some quite serious fire power.  I think there were four guards on each house.  And like the Clewer incident, there was this insult, and the, there was in a sense a retaliation for that remark, but that must be seen in the sense exactly like Mr Stewart argued that this was making a statement about the IFP's presence in this area and that obviously facilitated the objectives of the IFP in that area, in the sense that one couldn't treat the IFP in this manner.  It certainly wasn't a matter of any personal revenge.  Clearly it was sparked by an attack of an organisational nature, a verbal attack, attacking the organisation as opposed to the individual, and the retaliation was likewise, against, it was an attack by a member of an organisation against another member of an organisation.  The justification in that submission is that clearly these persons must have been ANC people in the light of the territorial position, that there weren't many IFP people in that particular area, in fact there were only two houses, so clearly if there was any other IFP person within that area, the applicant certainly would have recognised that person.  That's as far as I can take that, but I submit that this is clearly a case which arose as a result of the political conflict at the time, and that, amnesty, the requirements have been met as regards of this issue.\n\tIn that issue, I just want to state that my Heads are slightly inaccurate, and I think this was brought up in the evidence, that it's not only for the murder of Bongani Ntombela that amnesty is sought, it's also for the attempted murder of the other four persons.  I would respectfully request that that annotation be made.  You will recall that there were other persons in the crowd, I think policemen, who were shot at.\n\tWe withdraw the application in respect of 5.2. You will recall this was the, what was entitled the revenge attack, for the killing of Siphiwe Mvuyani which involves applicant five.  The basis of the withdrawal is that nothing was in fact done.\n\tIn regard to 5.3, the failure to report murder of a man and woman in the ANC areas in Ndwedwe, that we've modified, and I submit correctly.  What occurred here is the applicants applied for amnesty in respect of the murder of these persons. You'll recall this incident.  He was doing his work as a KwaZulu policeman, as a policeman sorry, in Ndwedwe, and he was in his van and him and his occupant got shot at from some distance.  \tThey radioed for another van, another van to go to the house, and they then went themselves.  Basically the police entered the house, and shot first of all a man in the house, and then later on the applicant heard another shot emanating from the back of the house, when one of the police colleagues came to him and said that he had killed a woman, and it later transpired that this woman was pregnant.  Now clearly there's no common purpose on the part of the applicant in regard to this attack.  It happened without his knowledge in respect of both of those murders, but as a duty, he had a duty as a policeman to report these issues, and he didn't do so.  \tNow the politics of that is quite simply that KwaZulu policemen would not investigate cases which involved ANC persons, and in that regard I submit that the political motivation for the omission is justified.\nAs regards the issue at 5.4, the attempted murder of unknown ANC members at a school in Ndwedwe, again you will recall what happened here is that it was believed by the applicant that the SANDF who were patrolling that area were supporting the ANC.  They then got involved in this ploy to throw apples and oranges I think inside the police casspir, and then the police got worried about this, anyway a deal was struck eventually whereby the army, should I say, started assisting them in their operations.  And what happened was there was a meeting being held in an ANC area and persons came out of that meeting, and the applicant together with members of the SANDF shot at these people.  Again the motivation here is based on the attacks on ANC persons, and that's part of the political conflict in the area.\n\tThe last incident involves applicant seven, also when he was employed initially after his training at Koeberg, to guard a certain school in Imbali in Pietermaritzburg, and when he was there certain youths started throwing stones and he retaliated and he recollects that two were injured.  Here again it was an attack on people predominantly in an ANC area.  He was making a statement about the IFP property, at the time, you do something like this to the IFP and the IFP will make a political statement and react.  That's as far as I take the matters.\n\tIn Section 6 of the Annexure 1, I detail the specific provisions which, in my humble submission, the applicants have contravened in relation to the possession, supply of firearms, ammunitions and explosives ...(intervention)",
