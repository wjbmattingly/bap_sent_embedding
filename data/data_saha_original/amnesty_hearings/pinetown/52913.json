That was in the Kaluza area in Pietermartizburg.  With regards to Mpumuza, the Kaluza people wanted to absorb this area and make it ANC stronghold but the Mpumuza area was an IFP stronghold therefore this conflict started between the ANC and the IFP, that is between the two areas, Mpumuza and Kaluza.

There was a man supplying ANC with weapons to attack the Mpumuza area, that is where I stayed.  Some person who had fled Mpumuza to Kaluza and Mr Sibonelo Dlamini gave us information that at Kaluza there is somebody who supplies weapons for them to go attack the Mpumuza area and this person apparently worked at one of the police stations in Durban, that is in kwaMashu and that was the person who was helping the people in Kaluza to attack Mpumuza so that Mpumuza can become an ANC stronghold.

            "We discussed this matter with Tabani and he told me that after receiving this information that this person supplies weapons to the ANC.  I should try and find out information.  He said he had also worked at kwaMashu Police Station.  I said that I will try and trace this person Sumusesu Gumede and he said I should try indeed to trace him and try to find out if he does work at the kwaMashu Police Station because he was the one behind our attacks at Mpumuza.  I did this as he had instructed me and because he was a youth leader.  I then left for kwaMashu and I did discover that he indeed worked at the police station as a reservist at the police station.  I then reported to my brother that yes I had found out about Sumusesu Gumede and he said that it fine, he would then try that we meet and we obtain a vehicle that will transport us to go attack him because we could not get hold of him Kaluza.  They would sometimes meet at Kaluza when he came to bring the weapons but there were a lot of people around that area including women and children therefore other people would get hurt, people who were innocent if we actually attacked him there, but because we wanted just him alone we decided that we should go and attack him at kwaMashu.  We then planned this in 1991 on the 16th April, that we should proceed to the kwaMashu Police Station where we found out there was where Mr Gumede worked.  Tabani said that we should try and contact Mr Patrick Zondo who was on good terms with him, who could help us in supplying a vehicle for us to transport us to Durban.  I had also discovered that this person used to work at the school, Tandakwazi was a school in kwaMashu, doing the night shift 6 to 6.  We left my home and we went to Mr Zondo at the Mpumuza area and Tabani asked him to transport us to Durban but we did not give Mr Zondo the entire information that we were going to attack this person.  Tabani told him that he was going to see a friend in Durban.  We could not divulge everything we had to Mr Zondo because we did not completely trust him to keep the information to himself.\n\tMr Zondo agreed to take us.  We then used his car and proceeded to Durban to kwaMashu where we would find Mr Gumede.  We left Pietermaritzburg at about 5 p.m. and arrived at kwaMashu at about quarter past 6 in the evening.  We parked our car opposite the school, Tandakwazi, and my brother said I should get off and I alighted from the car and I looked around and I realised that he had not arrived as yet so we decided to go back to the police station because the police vehicles would transport people who were going to do guard duties around the area, therefore it could be that maybe they had not left the police station.  We went back to the police station.  We met a certain man and I enquired if the guards had left and he said, yes it seems like the had left.  We then returned to the school where he was supposed to be, that is Mr Gumede.  When we arrived near the school we saw this person approaching from the hostel, approaching the school.  We sat in the car and he went into the school where he was supposed to do his guard duties.  We told Mr Zondo that we were returning shortly and we left him in the car.\n\tMy brother and I went in and I showed him, I pointed him out the school.  I stood outside the school and my brother went in and he called out to him.  Mr Gumede seemed surprised when my brother called him to come to him and he tried to run away and my brother still tried to call him.  My brother drew his gun, he fired a shot, he missed him and Mr Gumede ran away.  He followed him, fired another shot and Mr Gumede fell.  He shot him at the back of the head and Mr Gumede fell.  We then went back to the car.  On our way back to the car I told him that we are sometimes attacked by people from the townships.  If you leave that gun behind and there is a bus stop nearby where he fell there will be people around, it could happen that those people would pick up this gun and use it to attack other areas.  I told him that we should not leave the gun behind because somebody else may see it and take it and use it elsewhere and it could be used in attacking other people, other IFP supporters or even ourselves and my brother agreed with me and we decided that we should take that gun.\n\tTabani picked up the gun and we went into the car.  We told him that we had found our friend and then we had to return.  We then returned to Pietermaritzburg to the Mpumuza area.  Mr Zondo dropped us at home and he proceeded to his home and we thanked him for his assistance.\n\tTabani was very pleased with my information because the ANC had gained strength because of the assistance that they had received from this person.  Our members were even afraid and people were afraid of joining the IFP.  I was also happy that we could find this person and we felt that the violence maybe will subside because this person was the one behind the supplying of the weapons that were used in the conflict.\n\tAfter a while, in 1992, it was discovered that the people who had killed Mr Gumede were now known to the police, that is myself, Tabani and Mr Zondo.  I do not know how this information leaked to the police, I just heard that Mr Zondo had been arrested in Durban and I was also being sought by the police.  I was also arrested with regards to the crime and I was charged and convicted.  Tabani was also arrested with regards to the same incident.  In 1992 we were released on bail.  During the same year in June, on the 3rd, police arrived, that is from the ...[indistinct] Police Station.  They said that they had gotten information.",

They said they were looking for Tabani because they'd heard that he was the one who had killed Gumede.  I told them that Tabani was in town.  They also asked if I was present during that incident.  They said I should pass the message to Tabani that they were looking for him.  Amongst the people who were there was Skiza Zuma, an ex IFP member and they said Tabani should be killed because he was responsible for killing ANC members.  I told that we had already been arrested and charged for this crime, what more do they want because we have been charged for that crime.\nWhen Tabani arrived I told him that the police and ANC \nmembers had been to our house and they were looking for him and we could see that they were looking out for a fight.\n\tOn the 4th at about 1.30 a.m. some people who called themselves police knocked on our door.  My mother enquired what did they want because they were kicking all doors.  They said we should open the house, they're looking for Tabani.  My mother refused to open the door because it was early in the morning.  They should return in the morning.  They insisted that they were the police, if we do not open the door they will kick the door down.  I said that we should not open the door.  They kicked the doors, broke the doors down and then they also threw petrol bombs and fired shots.  We could realise then that these were not the South African Police because police could not behave in that way.  We all went into the dining room, the house was burnt and they were firing shots.  One of the girls was shot in that incident.  I tried to run away.  I went outside into the veranda and they started firing at me.  I even saw one person who was with these people from kwaKaluza.  Skisa was saying they should kill me but I managed to break away and run away.  They continued firing.  I phoned the police from the one house, the Mabizela house, I phoned the police, the ...[indistinct] police, informing them of this incident.  When the police arrived we went to my home and we discovered that my mother had been shot and also my sister as well as that the house had been burnt down.

The problems regarding these sort of applications is usually the political motive, was there any order or was it on behalf of a political party or organisation.  Clearly in these circumstances, according to the evidence of the applicant, there was a political motive.  The question usually now derives and that is usually the problem of these situations where we can accept that there was a - let's call it, the applicant also called it - a war situation on the ground.  The situation perceived at that stage differs from any other situation in a normal community.  The dynamics of that situation was two groups fighting with each other.  The one group and it doesn't matter how we look at it, the one group trying to overpower the other group.\n\tIn this situation and dynamics, the one group will decide to attack the other group and kill people because that will benefit them in some or other way.  In these circumstances the applicant said no, it was done to take away the threat.  So the motive is clear, the take away the person which they perceived as the person supplying firearms would have been to a great benefit for his party, his community and even as he thought at that stage, his government.\n\tThen to say, well he didn't have a political motive, well we're almost saying well in a war situation there's two groups and one group wants to overpower the other and somebody dies according to that, there's no political motive, it just can't be.  Now the question is usually asked, the IFP especially in those circumstances, had a policy of non-violence.  So anybody that was a member of the IFP that had to live in these circumstances where we all know that people died, IFP died and ANC people died, that because they belonged to a party which officially said that there should not be violence, that makes any act of a member of that party doing something against that party's policy because that is not really true because the political party at that stage said and it was said by many of the leaders that the people may protect themself.  \n\tIf these members now say well, we have to protect ourselves and by protecting ourselves we have to take out the persons that is involved in killing us, what is he doing against what his party is telling him?",

The reason why I'm saying that is, if you look then at Section 20, sub-section 2(e) where it says \"the omission or offence was committed in the execution of an order of or on behalf of\", I'm of the opinion that it is clear from his subjective thoughts at that stage that this was done on behalf of the IFP, his community and the KwaZulu Government which he perceived as one.

It was a divided community, it was difficult to go to police, it was difficult to trust people.  Sometimes family members did not even trust each other and my request is, taken the situation, taken the fact of the time lapse that has transpired from then until now, I don't see the few contradictions in the evidence as of such a nature to reject the evidence of the applicant.  It's clear to me that he didn't try to hide anything.  He even, in cross-examination, when specific names was requested from him, he did give names of the leaders that referred back to his brother and so forth.\n\tI think that if there is a motive, it must be this motive, there was no other reason for them to kill this person.

I was going to say Mr Chairman, but funnily enough this is done 14 months down the line, when they were in the soup, when actually the quagmire was taking charge of them but if really, the intention was to act on behalf of the IFP and report to the IFP, what would you have expected then after the operation before landing in that quagmire to go to leadership, Mr Umhlongo and say \"this is what we have done and this is on behalf of the organisation\".  Fact, that was not done.  Then one really questions as to whether this was on behalf of the organisation.\n\tMr Chairman, it is true as the Chair also commented or remarked that the people heard from leadership that they had to protect themselves but we cannot go that distance and say the protection meant even the killing.  For that matter actually, the applicant said it clearly it was never the policy of the ANC to kill.",

The IFP, that's not the question of the proportionality, Mr Chair, I'm indebted to you, that's Section 23, I want to believe, (g).\n\tThe protection has always been there, by all organisations but more in particular to the IFP it was also there but not to the extent of killing and this is what the applicant has testified to.  If this is what he has said then in essence he is saying to us: \"I did that which was not sanctioned by the IFP\" which would not sanctioned by the IFP that is the killing.  So that takes him out of the realm of authority as expected in terms of Section 20.\n\tMr Chairman, the war situation, although I must say, refer to the remarks by the bench, particularly the bench to my right, that there was war in that area, the member said particularly in this area.  I don't want to say there was no war but what I'm saying is, are we saying this was a reaction to a turbulence or a disorder that was taking place in that particular area.  I may jump into Section 23, that is Sub-Section (b) where it says it must be reaction to a disorder to a - to mention those words.  Are we saying because of knowledge that this was a war zone at that time when the applicant and his brother approached and killed the deceased, it was a time when there was war?",

While you're on the issue of proportionality, could you just consider the implication of what the evidence was to a certain extent in that the applicant may have been under his brother's control and other his brother's orders as the leader?

            "To be fair to the applicant and to the question, I do concede and that is what the applicant also said that he was the leader and he gave commands and he ordered us to do whatever that needed to be done, I do concede to that, but I do not think the applicant was not in the position where he could disagree with the brother, more so that information was begotten and a meeting between the two of them ensued and if you think, if you talk of a meeting between two persons, it was this person, these people can negotiate and talk on certain issues on the same level.  Perhaps the influence, if it may be referred to, influence of the brother could be put onto the action itself but insofar as the planning and all, it was only the two of them in the meeting.  If their brother was so dominating, there won't even have been a meeting between the two of them.  The brother would have said, look fine we've got this information now this is what we are going to do and you carry out that.  But that is not the evidence, I don't know whether I've addressed this aspect.\n\tMr Chairman and Members of the Committee, on the question of the firearm, the intention as testified to by the applicant is that they wanted to give the firearm over to the leadership and to believe if this was the intention and if this was done, given to the leadership of the IFP, then one would be having no problem with the political objective insofar as this firearm is concerned, but the firearm is not even given to the leadership of the IFP.  If the leadership of that piece told thereof at court fourteen months down the line, now can it be said that the firearm, the taking of the deceased's firearm was done also on behalf and in interest of the IFP, I think the answer will be in the negative.  \n\tIn conclusion, Mr Chairman and Members of the Committee, my submission is that this, even if there is no such evidence as correctly indicated that there was, there could have been a fight between the applicant and his brother and the deceased, but what is funny here is that the planning is done by two brothers in their own house at home, not involving anybody of the organisation, two blood brothers and it's the two blood brothers from the house who go out and carry out this execution.  I find it very absurd.  I don't say that he should have called the informer but one would have expected really in the circumstances that I want to tell what has happened, I going to tell the Amnesty Committee that this is what happened and this was my informer and my informer is here to can testify to that effect.  We were just told about the informer but no evidence has been led in as far as the informer is concerned to endorse that actually this was done on behalf of the IFP, to protect the IFP.  I think, Mr Chairman, that is all, unless the Committee would like me to refer to any other thing.  Thank you.",

            "One response, Mr Chairman, there is a matter and I know these sort of instances it's always a problem where these attacks that took place on a local situation, that is that there's problems in that area and persons from that area makes a decision to go and retaliate sometimes revenge and the question is usually asked, this is revenge, it's not political.  All these matters, political motive is always intervened, so even in the circumstances where somebody's brother was killed before the time, it was my experience that the mere killing of the other person was not merely revenge, it's still that war situation.\n\tI went through some of the previous decisions of the Committee and several of them the same situation applied where there was a localised decision where the people after being attacked decided that they're now going to retaliate, that means the group of IFP or ANC people.  There is one specifically, that is the matter of Nsumela whose application 435/96.  What happened there, there was also violence and then there was a meeting.  Maybe not two people, there was a little bit more there at the meeting and there they decided that they must attack to curb the violence and then they attacked and killed somebody and their perception was that they were curbing the violence, stopping the violence.\n\tNow we must have a look at this applicant's subjective  situation.  His brother is the youth leader, the position in that as we know it, especially in Natal, is that these leaders have a lot of power and they are not questioned.  This is not the normal situation.  Leaders especially in an organisation that is built on the structures and historic structures of the Zulu, it is not easy to question your leaders.  Strong men and strong leaders are usually accepted with open arms and accepted as good leaders.  So I disagree with this questioning of what the brothers should have decided that maybe it wasn't right or it was wrong.   It is accepted, it is normal for these people to accept these sort of decisions if made by a leader, even if it's your brother.  That's all I want to say about that.",
