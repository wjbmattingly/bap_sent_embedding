First is the application of Joseph Ngema.  I gather there are a number of people here today who are interested in hearing the Ngema application.  Unfortunately, we cannot proceed with that application today and I do not want to put you to the inconvenience of coming and perhaps waiting all of tomorrow.  So we are now going to adjourn the Ngema application until 9.30 on the morning of Thursday 17th, that is this Thursday and I don't know if there are still people here or whether they are waiting outside now, I gather transport home will be arranged for them and arrangements will be made for them to be here on Thursday.  That is so isn't it?\n\tThe second matter is the Nyawuza matter which also is set down for this afternoon which will not be able to be concluded today and we have, after discussion, resolved that this one should be adjourned till 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, that is one Wednesday, 16th at 2 o'clock.  Are the persons interested in the Nyawuza application here?\n\tRight, those two will be adjourned and we will now proceed with the Mafu application.

The two matters that you've mentioned, Mr Chairperson, still exclude one matter.  That leaves us still with one matter and that is the matter of Tom Madlala.  This is a matter which is scheduled to begin tomorrow morning.  I think the large crowd that is present here is actually present in support of the Tom Madlala matter.  They contain, they consist mainly of prisoners.  Now the warders and the senior members of Westville Prison are present here and have expressed their concern that they need to take these prisoners back including the present applicant who is presently in prison at Westville.  Apparently they can't bring two vehicles, they will have to bring one vehicle, also apparently given the crowd, they would need a bus.  So apparently they need to get off between by 4 o'clock latest.  Thank you.\n\tMr Chairperson, now in the Mafu matter, I have a statement prepared.  I have asked my assistant to circularise a copy.  I hope that the Committee members do have a copy and the other two gentlemen.  Would that be marked Exhibit A?",
