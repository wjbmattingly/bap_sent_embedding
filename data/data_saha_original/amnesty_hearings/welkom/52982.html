Then on page 49 there is a General's name which should not be there, it's on page 47 paragraph 16.  In the middle you'll find five Generals and then General Oelofse's name should be deleted.  The applicant will explain this to the Committee.  On the same page, paragraph 16, the sixth line from the bottom where it's written: General Oelofse should be General Etsebeth.

<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, the instructions we received was to present these courses so that the election would not happen and then also to create chaos all over the country.</p>

<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why were they called like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> They were fighting Generals because in each district or area they gave the main instructions which would lead to war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> So the AWB prepared them for war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And you also said they did not want the election to take place, why were they opposed to this election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, according to the AWB it would have been a majority election and it would have moved on towards a communist party and the AWB didn't approve of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was Eugene Terre'blanche's viewpoint during all the meetings which you attended, what did he say with regards to the elections?</p>

<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, most of the meetings I attended he said that only through a barrel of a gun there would be negotiations with any communistic party, including the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And what did you think, what did you think of these meetings and what was told to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At that stage I believed firmly that it was indeed correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you also prepare yourself for the war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, I did indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Very well.  During 1992 on Jakob Morkel's farm in Khuruman you attended the camp of the AWB, is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And this camp, did it have any influence on you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, Chairperson, there I really saw that this country was heading towards a majority election and everything must be done to stop that, under the instructions of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> So did you become more active in the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, that's correct, Chairperson.</p>

<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> In 1993 I really became active within the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> If you say active, what exactly do you want to tell the Committee, what does that imply?</p>

<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> It was in order for us to present courses all over the country.  All the people were experts in explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> So you did not only act against anti-insurgence units but you gave training in explosives?</p>

<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And that was then in the use of explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And during February 1994 there was a meeting at Ventersdorp, can you just tell the Committee were meetings often held at Ventersdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, there were lots of meetings held there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why was Ventersdorp the place where meetings were to be held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Because the head office of the AWB was situated there, Chairperson and it was also centrally located to all the, as far as all the fighting Generals are concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And Eugene Terre'blanche, was that also his office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, that was indeed the case, it was his office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And during this meeting did you receive any instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, I did, Chairperson.  At this meeting I received instructions from my General, Nico Fourie, to start with this onslaught against the election which was to follow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And this General Fourie, was he one of the Generals who died in the skirmish which took place in Mmabatho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Can you remember the exact date when you received this instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Unfortunately not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> But it was before the Mmabatho incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That's correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And was it said to you that you must now start with the operations?  Where would this have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> It would have taken place in my region, the diamond region.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And did they tell you which targets you had to identify?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, the targets were white schools which became non-white schools, as well as any institutions which the National Party or the ANC Alliance was in favour or they were in favour of those parties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And were instructions given with regards to certain people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.  People in the ANC who were in favour of the ANC/PAC Alliance and more specifically their businesses or their property.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>MS VAN DER WALT:   What was the purpose, why did you have to focus on these targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, according to the information which we received and also the instruction, these were the people who in the community if we acted against them we would have been able to prevent the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Are these then people who supported the ANC/SACP Alliance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> After the meeting in Ventersdorp you attended a further meeting - and that's on page 49, Chairperson, at a certain Mr Koos Hough, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What type of meeting was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, it was one of the big meetings during that time before the election.  The final planning would have been done there and the people in the diamond region would then go into action before the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And what was discussed at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> They discussed - the BKA was present as well as the Volksfront members as well as the AWB, Chairperson.  The discussions were about the evening before the election and that specific evening bombs had to explode in the diamond region.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Now if you speak of the BKA, are you referring to the "Boere Krisis Aksie"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And during that time there was also the Afrikaner Volksfront under General Constand  Viljoen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And did these other parties also receive instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was your instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> My instructions were to create these explosions in Lichtenburg/Sanniehof/Ottersdal region, Chairperson.  And I received a direct instruction that day from General Etsebeth together with the leader, Eugene Terre'blanche to blow up a gas depot and also a railway line, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> This gas depot, is that the gas depot at Lichtenburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you receive any further instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The instructions which I received was that I also had to blow up the railway line.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And what about the instructions for General Fourie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The instructions which I got earlier that year in Ventersdorp were still my instructions and it was that I had to train people in the use of explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And after you received these instructions, did you do anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, yes.  General Fourie's instructions I followed, I got explosives together, I trained people and the instructions which I received that day with regards to the Lichtenburg gas depot and railway line I did not execute them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And then you started with certain explosions, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Page 50, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>	You and Mr Breytenbach, the other applicant then executed a certain operation in Bultfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, according to the information we received an ANC meeting would have taken place at Bultfontein.  Mr Breytenbach and myself then placed a landmine there, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Under whose instruction did you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Under the instruction of the leader, Mr Eugene Terre'blanche, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, where exactly did you place the mine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where exactly did you place the mine, the landmine?  You said you put a landmine at Bultfontein but where precisely was it, in the street or where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At the taxi rank in Bultfontein.  It was at the entrance of the taxi rank, Chairperson, in Bultfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What did it look like, this area where the taxi rank was and where exactly did you place the mine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, as far as I remember the taxi rank was at the side of the town in Bultfontein.  The taxi rank had an entrance and an exit and the landmine was planted at the entrance or the exit, I can't remember, I'm not sure, but it was at the gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was your purpose, why did you place it there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The purpose was because an ANC meeting would have taken place there according to our information and it was in order to create chaos in order to prevent the elections from happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Very well.  So you've placed this explosive device at the entrance, did you want that a vehicle detonate this landmine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, that is what we wanted to happen.  A vehicle would have created the explosion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And that was your purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, unfortunately a person with a bicycle went over the explosive device and unfortunately he died.  This is the person Kleinbooi Ramolla, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Can you remember the date or the month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> It was in February, I think the 28th Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Who was with you when you placed this device there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Piet Breytenbach, the other applicant, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> It was only the two of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, it was only the two of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You make mention ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Ms van der Walt, you're mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I can't get mine off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You mention in paragraph 18 on page 15 that after the instruction of General Fourie you went and placed this bomb there, are these the instructions that you received in February of 1994 in Ventersdorp?  Is this the instruction to which you refer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did General Fourie specifically tell you to go to this particular taxi rank or did you have to find your own targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, according to information that we had, we had to find our own targets, targets were not pointed out for us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> But the instruction was to create chaos specifically where ANC/SACP persons would be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> During May of 1994 - paragraph 19, Chairperson, on page 50 ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you say May?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I'm sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you say May 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> No, March.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> March, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>	Further explosions were caused by you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Could you tell the Honourable Chairperson where and how this happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, this was at Kazee's Cash Store, this was a shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Where, in which town was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> This was in Sannieshof as well as Doringbult Primary School which was previously a white school and this was close to Delareyville as well as the Momoroti Primary School at Ottersdal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Can we then start with Mr Kazee's Cash Store, why did you cause an explosion there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Because he was a strong supporter of the ANC according to our information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And at the Doringbult Primary School?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Doringbult Primary School was previously a white school, Chairperson, which was handed over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Ja?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> And it became a non-white school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And the Momoroti Primary School?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The Momoroti Primary School was a school that was built by an AND supporter and was maintained by him.  This was a Mr Beukes in Ottosdal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And these explosive devices according to your application did not detonate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, they didn't explode.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> So no damage was done to the properties there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Mr Strydom, why didn't they explode, were they found and defused or was it just faulty explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, most of them were faulty devices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When you placed these explosive devices at the school, when would this be detonated, during the period that the children would be in school or in the evening or what was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, the bombs that we placed were for the purpose that it had to go off at night and the explosives were set for 3 o'clock at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And the one at the shop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The same time, at three in the morning it would explode.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Not to cause any injury to people, it was more concerning the property of persons at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And then you mention on page 51 at paragraph 20 that about a week after you placed the explosive device you went to the SABC tower in Zweizereineke, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What did you do there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, at that stage the media was also seen as the enemy of the AWB as to their support of the government of the day at that stage and to the ANC Alliance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And what did you want to do there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> We wanted to damage one of those broadcasting towers so it would not work in that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And did you do it then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> We did it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, it did detonate but no damage was done to the tower.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You went back twice, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And both times nothing happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And during April '94, was that - you cannot recall the specific dates, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> But this was before the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You placed another explosive device at Agriman at Ottosdal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why did you place the explosive device there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The owner of the property was a BKA member and infiltrated the AWB and according to our information he would pass over intelligence to the Security Police who worked for the government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And then you mention a Mr Smit who owned this business and you say he was an ANC orientated person, he was favourable towards the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Is this the one you speak of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And who accompanied you when you placed this explosive device?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Piet Breytenbach.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The devices did detonate and damage was done to the building as well as some other buildings in the surrounding area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Was anybody killed or injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Nobody was killed or injured there, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When did you place this explosive device, during the evening or during the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> This was at night and this one was also detonated at three in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Ms van der Walt, just before you proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>	Mr Strydom, you've spoken now about placing explosive devices at those two schools and at Kazee's Cash Store, at the tower etc., now was Mr Breytenbach with you on each of those occasions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just the two of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Can I continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> On the 12th of April 1994 you once again placed explosive devices?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> This was at the Sannieshof Liquor Store?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And who accompanied you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> It was Mr Breytenbach and Mr Piet Wessels, one of the other persons whom I had on one of my courses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Very well.  And you also went to a Doctor Breytenbach, a medical doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You went to his consulting rooms and placed a bomb there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why did you place the explosive devices at these two places?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, the information that we had at that stage was a person whom we knew as Johnny Portuguese, everybody in the are knew him as such, and he was favourable towards the ANC because he donated money to the ANC as well as Doctor Breytenbach who was a supporter of the ANC, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And did these explosions take  place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, Chairperson, both explosions took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And was anybody killed or injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Once again nobody was killed or injured, Chairperson, this was also in the middle of the night, in the early morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why at that stage did you take Mr Wessels with you and all the other times you only had Mr Breytenbach accompanying you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, because at that stage we stayed at Mr Wessels' farm and we manufactured explosives there and because he completed the course he went with us at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> On page 52, paragraph 23 you mention that you stayed at Wessels' farm, this is at Groot Mariko, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And you needed some more explosives, what did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I contacted General Etsebeth and told him that we needed some more explosives and a while after that I received a telephone call from an unknown person who gave me the delivery place of the explosives where we had to collect it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That's the manner how you went about acquiring explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, certain types of explosives which were not easily accessible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> How did you get your hands on these explosives, were they handed to you, what was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, the telephone call that I received from an anonymous person afterwards was to tell me that I had to collect the explosives on a bridge on the De La Rey Road.  He told us what time we had to be there and found the explosives there at the bridge but I did not see who delivered it there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And where did you take the explosives to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> We went back to Mr Piet Wessels' farm, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I notice that in your application you say you went to the farm of Mr Piet Breytenbach's father and you buried the explosives there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, we went and buried it there but he had no knowledge of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Ms van der Walt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>	What sort of explosives were these, Mr Strydom, were they military explosives or the sort of explosives they use on mines, dynamite, what was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> It was more explosives that they used in the mines, Chairperson, Dyna Gel, Nitro Glycerine.  That is from fertilizer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And the charges?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> This was also received from the mines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> So Mr Breytenbach's father had no knowledge of what was stored on his farm or what you were busy with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you go about this secretively?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, we did not want to involve many people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> At the AWB head office you collected detonators?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, it was a meeting that we had there where I contacted Mr Cliffie Barnard and he gave me some explosives at head  quarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Cliff Barnard, this is the accused who is responsible for the explosion in Johannesburg before the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And did he work at head office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When you speak of head office where you collected these detonators, was this in the building or was it hidden somewhere?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, it was in the building, it was a storage room in the office of head office in Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> The leader, Eugene Terre'blanche, would he be aware that these detonators would be stored there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, my personal opinion is that I believe that he knew.  It was a storage room where everyday cleaning agents were stored, brooms and such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And you continue further on page 52, paragraph 25 you mention that you bought pistols, can you tell the Honourable Committee what happened there and why.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I did not buy the pistols myself, I had very little money at that stage.  Mr Piet Wessels who was with us the evening, when we bought the pistols at Hartebeesfontein or in that area where he bought three Z88 pistols with a cheque, a cheque of Mr Wessels.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> From whom did he buy it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> He bought it from Mr Lukas Swart of the BKA at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And why did you buy these weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, we bought the weapons because it was cheap and at that stage it was difficult to acquire weapons and when we found the place to buy it we bought it so it could be used in the war when we go over to war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Do you have any knowledge whether Eugene Terre'blanche at several meetings mentioned that you had to acquire weapons for the war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, at several meetings he said that we had to collect weapons as well as ammunition and if we couldn't buy it we had to steal it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And the farm where you and Mr Breytenbach lived, were you also in possession you and Mr Breytenbach, you were also charged of the possession of a 357 Taurus and a 308 rifle and several rounds of ammunition, where did you get these weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, the revolver was Mr Piet Breytenbach's as well as the rifle.  I think one of the two he inherited and the other on he bought and it was being handed over to him.  The weapons were stored in a cupboard on Groot Mariko, Mr Wessels' farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And there were no licences for these firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Not as far as I know, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You continue, Mr Breytenbach, Mr Wessels and yourself were arrested before the elections, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, that is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why did you decide not to execute your instruction to blow up the gas depot in Lichtenburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, the gas depot is located centrally in Lichtenburg, there are houses surrounding the place and it would have killed many people if we did execute our instruction there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> But you received the instruction from General Etsebeth, why did you not execute it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I did receive the instruction from General Etsebeth with the approval of the leader, Mr Eugene Terre'blanche.  I did not execute the instruction because I did not go out to kill people, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was General Fourie's opinion with regards to the killing of people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> At no stage did General Fourie give me any instruction to kill people or to injure any people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you do any reconnaissance work in Lichtenburg at the gas depot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I did, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You several times mentioned that you caused these explosions to stop the elections, what do you think would have happened, why did you think that the election would not go ahead if these explosions took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, as soon as one causes chaos in any circumstances, it would not go as it was planned and the chief reason was to create chaos before the elections to keep the people away from the voting boxes so that they do not vote.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> So you wanted to install fear in the public?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you personally gain in this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, Chairperson, at no stage.  Not even with bail did I receive any assistance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And on whose behalf did you commit these actions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> It was on instruction for the AWB and for my people and my fatherland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you believe that you would further the objectives of the AWB in this manner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is what I believed, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you have any grudge against anybody where you caused these explosions or at the taxi rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> None, Chairperson, I did not even know these people.  (end of tape)</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> ... after there was a change in the country with regard to the acts that you committed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I'm very sorry for what I've done.  After the time since we've been charged and we appeared in the Supreme Court and I can now see that things can happen if negotiated.  And we were told that the AWB would not, if they would negotiate it would not help because they were negotiating with a communist party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Are you still a member of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Where are you employed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I work in St Lucia, Chairperson.  I am a traffic officer there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> After you were arrested, did you participate in any actions or meetings of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And you also in Exhibit B state the objectives of the AWB and reasons as to why these actions were political actions, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And do you confirm the contents of Annexure B?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Is there anything else you would like to add?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, only that I am sorry for what I have done, and for as long as I live I will not do these things again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS VAN DER WALT</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Prinsloo, do you have any questions to ask the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>	Mr Strydom, when you planted the landmine at the taxi rank did you foresee the possibility that somebody could have died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, I did, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And according to a statement which you will find on page 98 of the bundle, Chairperson.  It's a statement of a certain Mr Manual Amaro Pereiro, and he says amongst others and I'll read it, it's in English</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>"In my opinion the only reason ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>The words aren't very clear.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>"... them had to plant bomb at my business was because I let black people sleep in my hotel."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>Was that the reason why you planted the bomb there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, Chairperson, it was not the reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And the bomb you planted was part of the liquor store, it was not at the hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, it was at the liquor store next to the hotel, it had nothing to do with the hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The applicant, Mr Breytenbach whom I represent, according to my instructions he always acted under your command on behalf of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.  Even though we had the same rank I was still the senior officer whilst we fought this war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRINSLOO</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma, do you have any questions to ask the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, Chairperson, just a few.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>	Mr Strydom, as I understand it there reason why you planted these explosives to the various places which you have just mentioned is because you did not want the elections to go ahead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, in order to create chaos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And because the then National Party Government was collaborating with the ANC towards those elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And you had to attack the ANC oriented areas and supporters, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> The properties of those people, that is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And in all these attacks that you waged, you have never attacked any National Party Government oriented property, is that not the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was the tower, the SABC.  I don't know, they would vehemently deny that it was Nationalist Party but it was at that stage one could say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was a government paid for property.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, I understand, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you can put the question.  Carry on, I'm not stopping you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Why were your attacks - why were your targets predominantly ANC and not that of the National Party Government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, as you yourself said, it was not only the ANC, if you look at Agriman, that was also a National Party member, Chairperson.  And it was not only meant for the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And let us go to the bomb that killed Mr Ramolla.  You say you had to place that bomb because there was going to be an ANC meeting in that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> But surely the meetings was not going to be at the taxi rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, that was the means of transport as far as we knew because most of the ANC members would arrive by means of public transport, people who would have gone to the town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And am I correct when I say that that taxi rank was a taxi rank used by the black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, by ANC supporters for that specific meeting, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> That was a public day, the taxi rank was used by everybody, not necessarily people for the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That's correct, Chairperson but we felt whilst we investigated this, that the person who was not a member of the ANC would not go to town that specific day because he would have been scared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Why?  Why would a person not go to town because there's an ANC meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, if we look at the previous marches the ANC held in towns and the damage which was caused, because of that we inferred that any person who was not a member or supporter of the ANC would not go to town.  We also know that most of the workers did not go to work on such days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Is it not because you attacked that place because you wanted to kill black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, Chairperson, under no circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And at the school which was owned by Mr Beukes, Mr Beukes was not a teacher of that school, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, he wasn't a teacher.  He lives right opposite the school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And there was no way that he would be injured if that bomb detonated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Under no circumstances, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> The potential people who would be injured are those black children who were students at that school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I did not hear the question properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Had the bomb that you planted there detonated, the only potential victims there are the black scholars who were attending that school, is ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, Chairperson, the bomb which they found there had a watch mechanism and it would have detonated at 3 o'clock in the morning, like all the others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it a boarding school, did they kids sleeping in a hostel there that might have been a victim if it had gone off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, Chairperson, it was basically just a school, people only attended the school during the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> On page 94 of the paginated bundle there is a statement there by Mr Beukes, the owner of that school and on the 5th paragraph there, Mr Beukes denies that he was in any way oriented to the ANC, what is your comment to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, everybody in the Ottosdal vicinity as well as Sannieshof and Delareyville know Mr Beukes and also knows that he's an ANC supporter as regards to politics and also that he strongly supported the National Party/ANC Alliance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, I have no further questions, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms van der Walt, do you have any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> No re-examination by Ms van der Walt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MS VAN DER WALT</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Doctor Tsotsi, do you have any questions to ask the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> No, questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibanyoni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Just a few, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a>	Mr Strydom, I didn't follow you correctly.  You said Mr Beukes was a supporter of the NP/ANC Alliance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Was there such an alliance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> With the negotiations yes.  According to the AWB the National Party since the release of the State President, Mr Mandela the National Party was in an alliance with the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You are referring to them negotiating the future of the country together, not necessarily that they were in partnership in any form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Usually there are some night watchmen at schools, at this particular school was there no night watchmen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You say you didn't implement the mission at Lichtenburg because there were people living there, you didn't go out to kill people.  Which people were living there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> People from the prison live around there, as well as policemen and all members of the public.  It had nothing to do with race, it was a multi-racial area.  There were people from all sections of society living there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But if you were not going out to kill people, you wouldn't put a bomb at an entrance of a taxi rank because at that one specifically there will be a person who will be killed if that bomb was detonated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, we foresaw that people could get injured with the explosive device in Bultfontein but it was more about the meeting and hopefully we wanted it to cause damage to a vehicle.  I was of the opinion that a big vehicle would create the explosion and that would be damaged.  Unfortunately it was a person on a bicycle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Didn't you stop the mission at Lichtenburg because you foresaw that also white people were likely to be killed but the one at Bultfontein taxi rank exclusively black people would be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> In other words you were not racist in your activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, not at all.  Since I can remember I've been working with all races in South Africa and I also have good friends who are from other races.  I'm not a racist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, no further questions, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Strydom, that landmine that was placed at the taxi rank, was it a homemade landmine or was it a military landmine, they type that the army uses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> It was homemade landmine, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't know much about explosives but how powerful was that mine, let's say compared to the average landmine that's used by the military in a war situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, if I can put it on a scale of 1-10, according to a military landmine I would say it's about 2 and military one would be about 10.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So your whole experience in this period that you've related, where you were a member of the Special Force, did you stay a member of that Special Force, you didn't become a member of the, or was it part of the "Ystergarde" or any other separate force within the movement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, Chairperson, we were used to work with them in groups at several meetings but I was not a member of the "Wen Kommando" or the "Ystergarde".</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> "Orde van die Dood" and those sort of divisions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And after the death of General Fourie in Mmbatho, who did you report to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> His second in command who was then called Oscar.  I received instructions from him, but there weren't any more instructions because it was so close to the elections, Chairperson.  The last meeting was the one at Mr Hough's house where I received instructions from General Etsebeth together with the leader, Eugene Terre'blanche.  It was with his approval.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms van der Walt, do you have any questions arising out of questions that have been put by members of the panel?</p>

<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Mr Strydom, it may happen that I didn't understand you very well.  In connection ...(inaudible).</p>

<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> It may happen that I didn't understand  you well.  In connection with the planting of the bomb at Bultfontein taxi rank, I thought I heard you initially say it was an instruction from Eugene Terre'blanche but when we read your documents it refers to General Fourie.  Can you clarify me on that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> He was present and his instructions had the approval of Mr Terre'blanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Who is higher in rank between Eugene Terre'blanche and General Fourie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, Eugene Terre'blanche was the leader of the AWB, therefore he would have had the highest rank but General Etsebeth was the General under his command and he was a fighting General.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You say the order was authorised by him but given by General Fourie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms van der Walt, any questions arising out of that last question?</p>
