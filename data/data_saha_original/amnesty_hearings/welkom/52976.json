And the place where they could get those arms was to disarm the police and the members of the South African Defence Force.",

It may appear in the eyes of the Committee that in view of the fact that the African National Congress had already suspended its armed struggle, the conduct of the applicant here was not justified but however, Mr Chairman, it is a very well-known fact that people who participated in political activities at various levels, especially in the level in which the applicant was participating, were not upraised of the decision of the National Executive Committee of the ANC.  \tI can further add that depending on the sophistication of the actual perpetrator, people were not even keeping updated about the events which are well publicised in the media.  The Committee should, Mr Chairman I submit, view the conduct of the applicant to befit his circumstances, his level of sophistication and the level in which he participated in the formations.\n\tSo it is my respectful submission that a political objective can be sometimes unreasonable but it remains such.  It is therefore my submission that the applicant has committed this offence with a political objective and consequently entitled to amnesty.  Thank you, Mr Chairperson.",
