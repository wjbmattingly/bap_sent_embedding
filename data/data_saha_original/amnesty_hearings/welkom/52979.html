<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  May I know call Jack Mofokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mofokeng, do you have any objection to taking the oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">JACK MOFOKENG:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR MHLABA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>	Mr Mofokeng, were you together with Phillip Mosia, Solomon Sera and Isaac Mohomane involved in an incident where two police officers were killed?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> And you are presently serving a prison term in respect of the offence, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> And the reason for you coming before this Committee today is to apply for an amnesty in respect of those offences, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> For record purposes, can you confirm whether you were born in 1960 on December the 1st, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Your educational background, up to what standard did you go at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> I ended up in standard three, when I passed standard three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> The reason you apply for amnesty is that the offences which you've committed were committed with a political objective, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Can you explain to the Committee if you belonged to any political movement during the period June 1993 and also the name of the organisation and your level of involvement therein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> I was an ANC supporter and then in 1991 I joined the SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> How did you come to join the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> I was recruited by Isaac Mohomane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> And did he tell the - did you know of the existence of those SDUs and do you know what they were all about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Yes, I had information that they were protecting the community.  That was the main task of the SDU.  It was divided into two groups.  There was this SDU that was known to the community but I was operating under this SDU that was not known to the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> You've indicated in your application form that you were a member of the African National Congress, do you know if there is any relationship between the SDU within which you were operating and the African National Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Was there a relationship?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> That's correct, there was that relationship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Who was your immediate commander in the SDUs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> It was comrade Mohomane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Were you getting orders from him only or were you getting orders from any other person other than him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> No, I only received instructions from comrade Mohomane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> And were you satisfied that your comrade was acting within the level of command of the African National Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> That is correct, I was satisfied because I had faith in him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> How long have you known Mr Mohomane before he recruited you to the SDUs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> I only knew him in 1991, in October.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> You were then involved in this incident where the two police officers were killed, can you tell the Committee how you planned the killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> We planned this operation at Beirut, at comrade Mosia's place but by then I already knew that the police have to be attacked.  We met there on Thursday and then they said we should come back again on Friday, like they have already explained that they found me there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Before the planning of this killing, were you aware that Mohomane was a suspect in a robbery case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> No, I didn't know about that, I only learnt of that after I was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Can you continue and explain to the Committee how everything was planned and subsequently executed, with full details of every transaction which followed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Comrade Mohomane told us that the leadership has instructed the soldiers and the police should be attacked and we should attack all the government buildings and police stations but he said we should not take their weapons because the police were harassing the community.  They were killing the people.  We were being attacked by police dogs.  So that is how the instruction was given to us, that we should attack the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>	Then we went out, that is Solomon Sera and Isaac Mohomane.  I was left at comrade Mosia's place with him.  I had a 9mm with me.  When they came back and they told us they have identified the police vehicle at the shopping complex so they've come to collect us, me and comrade Mosia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>	When we arrived at the shopping complex I saw that police van, then we sent Phillip Mosia to go inside and confirm whether police were there.  When he came back he told us that he saw three policemen.  That is how he explained to us, that they were still having their meal inside the restaurant and they were policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> You mentioned that when you went there you found a police vehicle and identified it to be such, do you know whether this vehicle was driven by, was being used by specific police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> I only knew that it was used by the police but I did not know specifically which policemen were using that car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Yes, you may proceed and explain to us from the moment when you have sent Mosia to go and check if they were in fact the police who were inside there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> He came back and he confirmed that they were police but he didn't tell us their names, he just said to us he saw three policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>	So we waited for them but they never came out.  He went back inside.  So when he went inside he realised that they were about to leave the restaurant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>	A few minutes thereafter they came out to their vehicle.  While they were approaching their vehicle we saw them and that is when we attacked them.  We shot at them till the two died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> I am able to note from your application form, that is page 18 of the paginated bundle, that your signature at the foot of your application appears to be a different handwriting from the rest of the information which is completed in the form.  Can you tell the Committee who completed this form on your behalf?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> The person who filled this form for me was my commander, that is Isaac Mohomane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> You have already indicated that you went up to standard three, were you able to comprehend this application form, to read and understand it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> No, I did not understand this application form but there were other places or portions of this application that I would understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> So in other words you relied mainly on your commander to assist you, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> So you're telling this Committee that the police officers were identified as legitimate targets of the SDUs and that was the information which you were getting from your commander, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Can you repeat the question please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Is it your case that the police were identified by the command structures as a legitimate target of and enemies of your political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Yes, we regarded them as our enemies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Is it your case that in eliminating these police officers you were ensuring that your political organisation obtained its objectives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> And these police officers were regarded as stumbling blocks, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> ...(no English translation)  That's correct, because they were wrongfully used by the regime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Other than what you've already explained to the Committee, do you have anything to add in support of your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> I'm very happy that this Committee has made it possible for me to meet families of the deceased so that I can ask for forgiveness before them, because it was not my intention, it was because of the unrest and violence of that time that we ended up killing these policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>	We as the members of the ANC and the SDU did not accept what the police were doing to the community, so I'm happy now that we have achieved our goals, that is freedom.  So I also ask for forgiveness so that I can be free and I can come out and contribute to the upliftment of our communities outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> Thank you, Chair, that concludes the evidence of the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Sesele, do you have any questions to ask the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR SESELE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>	Mr Mofokeng, when you were recruited into the SDU by Mr Mohomane, were you told what was going to be your job, your work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> You said there were two groups of SDUs, one group was known to the community and the other one was not known to the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> And you belonged to the group that was not known to the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> That is correct, we were known by the leadership.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> What was the work of the first group that was known by the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> It was the same work that we did to protect the community but they were not doing exactly what we were doing in terms of methods to protect the community because we were an underground structure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> And your immediate commander was Mr Mohomane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Yes, that is correct, it was comrade Mohomane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> Did you have regular meetings with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> We met once or twice a week.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> Except for Mr Mohomane, was there any other leader from a higher structure whom you knew?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> It appears from your application forms that no mention is made of Mr Mohomane, do you remember making mention of his names when these application forms were completed by him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Yes, that is correct.  I explained to him and then he said to me we would only mention his name when we appear before the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> When you were called and you heard that there were two police officers in the restaurant, were you told the names of those police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> No, Sir, I was not told of their identity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> In Court a certain witness called Mr Kele gave uncontradicted evidence that Mr Mohomane is the one who made the suggestion that Sergeant Makau should be killed because he was investigating a case against him, did you hear anything like that in Court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> That is a lie, that is a person who was used by the police, he was bought with money because even in Court he said he does not know me though we know each other, then he said he doesn't know me.  Then I asked him why does he deny that he knew me ...(no English translation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> Did you personally know the two police officers who were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> I did not know them, I only knew the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> After the shooting incident, say even in prison, was there any mention made of Sergeant Makau?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> You mean when we were in prison or do you mean during the trial or when we were in prison?  It was that person called Kele who created that confusion.  He came to us with money and he wanted to bribe our comrade, so that was the person who was creating that confusion.  I didn't hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> Whilst you were in prison before you were convicted, didn't you hear Mr Mohomane talking about Sergeant Makau?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> No, Sir, we were not in the same cell with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> Throughout your detention you have never been in the same cell with Mr Mohomane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> I don't know those people, I didn't hear them.  I didn't hear Mr Mohomane mention those names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> You didn't know Mr Mohomane, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> Are you saying that you didn't know ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> I'm saying I did not know the identity of those policemen and I didn't even hear Mr Mohomane mentioning their names whilst we were in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> You said you understood from Mr Mohomane that the ANC leadership approved of your actions, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> May you please repeat your question, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> You said you got the impression from Mr Mohomane that the SDUs you were going to be involved with in attacking the police station, attacking the police, that action of yours was known by the leadership and approved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Yes, I do, because he was my commander.  I agreed with whatever he said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> I put it to you, Mr Mofokeng, that when the shooting in particular Sergeant Makau, the only person who had to gain and perhaps even yourself, was Mr Mohomane because he wanted to get rid of somebody who was investigating him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> I don't know that, I hear that for the first time from you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> At the restaurant, if I heard you properly you were told that there were three policemen in the restaurant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Comrade Mosia informed us that there were three.  We were surprised that we only saw two.  Even if it was a lot of policemen in that kombi we would attack them still.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> Would you know what happened to the third policeman in the restaurant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Can you please repeat your question, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> Would you know what happened to the third policeman in the restaurant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> I don't know, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SESELE</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Sesele.  Mr Mapoma, do you have any questions to ask the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I have no questions, Chairperson, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you have any re-examination, Mr Mhlaba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> No re-examination, thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MHLABA</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Doctor Tsotsi, do you have any questions to ask the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> One or two questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>	About the SDUs, how are they constituted?  You say there were two SDUs, one for the community and another one underground.  How was the community SDU constituted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> We were working underground, we were an underground movement.  So people knew us during the day, they just took us as normal people, as ordinary people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Yes, but you don't answer my question.  My question was, what about the SDUs who were known to the community, how were they constituted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Their main function was to report to our commanders about the operations, then we will receive our instruction through them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> How were they made up?  I'm trying to find out if there is any connection between them and the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>Do you know or don't you know how they were formed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> I did not know how they were constituted, maybe their commander knew about that because I was not part of the leadership so I didn't have that information then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Now you say that Mohomane told you that the leadership had ordered that the police should be attacked, did he explain to you who this leadership was that he was referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> He told us that we'll have to meet Mr Mofokeng but unfortunately I was arrested before I could meet Mr Mofokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Are you saying that Mofokeng was part of that leadership?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> That is how he explained it to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESELE:</span> But you don't know the higher leadership?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> In our area Steve Potlela was one of the leadership there but I don't know other leaders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> To whom was Mr Mohomane answerable, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> He told me about Mr Mofokeng, he never mentioned other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibanyoni, do you have any questions to ask the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>	You spoke about two SDUs, one known to the community, the other not known to the community.  My question is, did the SDU known to the community attack any police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> No, it did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> If I say to you it's for the first time that I hear that there was some SDU which was operating underground, not known to the people, what would be your response?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> I've got that information, that is how this was explained to me by Isaac Mohomane.  So I'm surprised that is the first time that you hear about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> If the community did not know about your structure, the SDU, how would they approach you and ask for protection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> They did not have the powers to approach us.  They were supposed to approach our commanders and our leaders and our commanders will come to us and give us instructions.  That is, people including Isaac Mohomane they will give us instructions to protect the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did Isaac Mohomane tell you why when completing the forms you shouldn't mention his name but only when you appear before the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> He told me that it was not necessary.  He said to me it will only be necessary if I mention his name here before the families of the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> When he was assisting you, were you alone or were you in the company of the other applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> It was only the two of us, me and Mr Mohomane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Can you perhaps briefly explain how this attack took place, who actually shot at the two policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> It's myself and Isaac Mohomane who shot the two policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> How many times did you fire the shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> I don't remember, maybe it can be nine or ten times, but I don't remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> What type of weapon were you using?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> I was a 9mm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Do you know how many times did Mosia fire shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Mosia did not shoot because he did not have a weapon, it's only myself and Isaac Mohomane who had weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Sorry, I wanted to say Isaac Mohomane.  Did you notice how many times he fired shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Well I don't remember, it may three times or four times, I don't remember well because he was armed with a 3.7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, no further questions, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thanks.  Mr Mofokeng, are you related to Mr Mofokeng, also known as Craig Khumalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> I've already explained that.  I've never that person until I was arrested.  I was only told by my commander that there is somebody known as Mofokeng but I've never met him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know what the point was in having two types of SDUs, why have an underground SDU and an open publicly known SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> To my knowledge people are not interested to join this SDU which was operating underground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, the question was, what is the point in having ...(end of tape)</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> The importance was that was to protect the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but that was also the function of the SDU known by the community, the ones which we normally hear of.  They were created for that purpose, it's apparent from their name, Self Defence Unit, but why have an underground one that no-one must know about?  If you don't know you must just say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Well I don't know, maybe my commander knows that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say there were four of you in your unit, the four applicants here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your unit just consisted of you, the four applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> Yes, it was only the four of us because other people were not interested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was this your first operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> That's correct, it was my first operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you joined the SDU in 1991 and you had no operations for the rest of 1991, the whole of 1992 and then your first operation was in June 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And yet you used to meet twice a week with each other, or at least with your leader?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Now what were your regular meetings for if not to plan for operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOFOKENG:</span> The importance of these meetings was to plan.  There were many things that we were discussing, including planning of operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Mhlaba, do you have any questions arising out of questions that have been put by members of the panel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MHLABA:</span> No thank you, I've got no questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR MHLABA</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sesele?</p>

<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR SESELE</p>
