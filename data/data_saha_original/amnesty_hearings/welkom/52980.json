Then he left this 15 shooter gun at my place and the 38.\n\tOn Thursday they came together with other SDU members.  Solomon Sera was not present.  Mofokeng arrived and Sera arrived later.  He came with a car.  They went together with Isaac Mohomane to go and identify targets.  They left.  After some time they returned.  It was at dusk.  Then they informed us they were able to identify a police car but they don't know how many policemen were inside that van, so we should go there.  \n\tSo he took this 15 shooter, he gave it to comrade Jack Mofokeng.  We went into the car.  We went to that place, shopping centre, we parked, then we saw that police van within other cars.  Then he instructed me to go inside so that I will be able to identify those policemen and how many there are.  \n\tI bought cigarettes, then I looked at those policemen, then I was able to identify them.  Then I bought the cigarettes, then able to identify the three policemen.  I went outside.  There were two male police and one female police.\n\tAfter informing them that after some time they informed me to go again inside the restaurant.  I went there for the second time.  Then I was able to see that they were finishing their meal, they were just about to go outside.\n\tThen I went outside, informed my comrades and said: \"It looks like they are just about to leave\".  He told Solomon Sera to leave and park the car so that we'd get the car ready.  After some time the police went outside the restaurant, then they looked as to whether who were going straight to the car.  \n\tI saw only two policemen going direct to the car, that is where they started shooting them.  I was at the back sitting down looking at them.  After they were shot at we went to the car where Sera was and then we went inside the car.  \n\tWe dropped comrade Mohomane at his place and comrade Mofokeng at his place.  After a day, that is on Saturday, Solomon Sera brought the gun, that is a 9mm to my place, then he told me that there are police and soldiers who are going inside all the houses in the vicinity, who were searching.  Then he said I should remove the gun in my place.\n\tA certain friend of mine whose name is Tshabalala arrived then I requested him to hide that gun at his or her place.  I told him or her that I would come and pick up that gun, I don't know when.   \n\tWe were arrested on the 9th and the police were looking for the gun.  That is where I led the police to Tshabalala.
