The rejection of the idea by the NP Government was a slap in the face.  The second category was aimed at the ANC, to bring them under the impression of the seriousness of this ideal of the Volkstaat and to encourage the ANC to agree with the forming of such a Volkstaat.  As it would seem, two thirds of these attacks were aimed at power and railway connections.  If a Volkstaat Committee was put in by the then government, these actions would never have taken place.\n\tThe establishment of the ANC Government has to ascribed to this campaign.  As explained above, I seek amnesty for the incidents for which I am charged: 22 charges of offences in accordance with Article 54.1 of Act 74 of 1982 and alternatively offences of Article 54(3) of Act 74 of 1982.
