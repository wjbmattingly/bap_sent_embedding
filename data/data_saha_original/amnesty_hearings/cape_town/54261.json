I want you to listen carefully because my question is going to be \"Does His Lordship's judgment of the credibility of the members of the CCB, apply to you, and is the same happening here?\"  Listen carefully.\n\"At this point I digress to observe that I have at various stages of this Inquest, had occasion to realise that several of the witnesses are trained, skilled and experienced in the art of deception.  They are, to put it bluntly, professional liars.  They make their living out of deception.  This is certainly true of Verster and the pseudo ...(indistinct) Luitingh and of Barnard.  Indeed it must be true to a great extent, of everyone who has worked as an operative for the CCB.  They have all been required to appear to have one occupation, the so-called front, whilst their main concerns have been their covert activities.  They are all aware of the need for apparently independent corroboration of whatever untruthful proposition they wish to have accepted for the truth, and they plan accordingly.  The so-called corroboration becomes as suspect as the proposition itself.  They are accomplished in the art of secret conspiracy.  When conflicts emerged between them, as happened in some instances, they showed themselves ...(indistinct) resourceful in falling back on other propositions which may themselves be nothing more than even more deeply laid conspiracies of falsehood.  In their world conflicting allegations by no means to be assumed to be conflicts between the truth and falsehood.  They just as easily could be conflicting falsehoods.  The truth lies very deeply buried and the task of those engaged in trying to expose it to view, is no easy one.  So it is with regard to the reasons why and the purposes for which Verster recruited Barnard to the outer circle of the CCB.  Of the various versions I have been given, I doubt whether any reveals the whole truth.  None of those versions touch on Barnard's character.\"\n...(intervention)",

There is a difference between a policeman who in the exercise of his police activities as a policeman, committed separate acts, some of which he might decide to ask for amnesty and some of which he may decide not to ask for amnesty, it does not apply where crimes are committed within the ambit of a general conspiracy by the Head of that conspiracy, Mr Chairman.  There is - the offence is, Mr Chairman, being a party to that conspiracy and the way you prove that conspiracy is what he did in pursuance of that conspiracy.\n\tAnd this business that you cannot give amnesty, Mr Chairman, to outside countries, is perhaps a practical matter for people who committed crimes within South Africa, who may want to travel.  That is their concern, Mr Chairman.  It is no reason, it is no reason for not asking a witness to say what he has done as the Head of that conspiracy, Mr Chairman, and we persist in asking questions, Mr Chairman.  The Act says, what happened within and without the Republic of South Africa.  The terms of reference of the Harms Commission were different, they said only what happened within South Africa.  There is no distinction.  And I would submit, Mr Chairman, that we are entitled to ask the questions.  The witness can refuse to answer if he so desires, but we are doing it, having given full notice that unless he answers these questions he will not have satisfied the provisions of the Act, Mr Chairman.\n\tDo you understand the position ...",

It was found that they with others had conspired to kill by means of a Renault 5 motor vehicle, booby-trapped with explosives, six persons believed by them to be members of the military wing of the African National Congress of South Africa who happened to be residing at 16 Jungle Road, Trenance, Bulawayo.  The plan was put into operation on the 11th of January 1988.  The deceased Obed Muanza, an unemployed person who was engaged for reward to drive the Renault 5 alone to the address in question.  He was totally unaware that it had been primed with a powerful explosive device.  Upon arrival at the front of the premises he sounded the hooter and then drove to the rear.  When the hooter was blown for the second time, there was a huge explosion.  It resulted in the instantaneous death of Muanza, whose body was mutilated beyond recognition and one of the residents sustaining the loss of an eye.  Their house was extensively damaged.  Adjacent to it was a crater about 2 1/2 m in diameter and 20cm deep.

            "Yes, a pity, but let me read to you.  Bundle D, page 41, this is the Commission' report.  Listen in the words of His Lordship what your CCB did, General Webb.\n\"Mr Mhlaba is an attorney in Durban.  A member of the CCB who operated in Swaziland and Mozambique, alleges that he obtained information that Mr Mhlaba was controlling finances for the ANC, besides which he was procuring weapons for the ANC.  Precisely what happened is not clear.  What is certain however, is that on the 4th of March 1989, Du Plooy was preparing a document dealing with the elimination of Mr Mhlaba by means of poisoning.  The poison was to be administered on the 13th of March 1989.\n\t\t\tThe reasons for the elimination, as set forth in the document, are that Mhlaba is a senior ANC member in this country, that he has secret means of communication with members abroad, that he recruits couriers, that he supplies military members with funds for operations, is involved with the UDF.  The document is incomplete and apparently there was an alternative to shoot Mhlaba.  Nothing came of these plans.  The reason why is doubtful in the light of the evidence.  Who was responsible for proposing and evaluating the elimination is also doubtful.  What is certain however is, a member of an external region was involved in the possible elimination of a citizen of the RSA within the borders of the country.  \n\t\t\tThe grounds for ...(indistinct) are appalling since the intended victim, if convicted in a court of law, would have received a sentence of imprisonment for his actions.  The factual basis underlying the reasons for his elimination is extremely shaky and suspect.  The problem regarding this document is that it may be indicative of an attempted conspiracy to murder.  As the three persons alleged to be involved are all untrustworthy witnesses, it is impossible to make any further factual findings concerning these events.\"\nNow what is clear in the first part of the statement that I read out to you, is that it was a member of the CCB who was not named by the Judge because at that time not all members were named, is that correct?",
