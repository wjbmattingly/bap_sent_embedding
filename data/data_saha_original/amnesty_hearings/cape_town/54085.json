In the post 1985 period it became more sustained.  The widespread demonstrations and more violent forms of dissent and opposition which began in the Vaal Triangle in August 1994 surprised not only the government but also the ANC.\"\nI want to read paragraph 144:\n\"The opposition of MK in this period can be categorised as follows.  Firstly there were bomb attacks on urban targets.  The targets selected were meant to be Security Force related but the reality is that more civilians than Security Force personnel were killed in such explosions.  The reasons included technical incompetence, faulty devices, poor reconnaissance, poor judgement or misunderstanding by operatives.  In addition there were some deliberate blurring of the lines which gave operatives the leeway to vent their anger of placing bombs in targets that were not strictly military.  Lastly, there were instances where explosives were tampered with or Security Force infiltration resulted in civilian deaths.\"\nNow I want to take you to paragraph 163:\n\"Finally the above took place in the context of a nation-wide state of emergency that effectively remained in place from June 1986 till mid 1990.\"\n164, the first sentence:\n\"In the year after the imposition of the national state of emergency the full force of the strategy of counter-revolutionary warfare unfolded domestically.\"\nIs that how you understood the situation to be prevailing in South Africa at the time that you were employed by the Special Forces, by CCB being the Special Force unit of the South African Defence Force at the time?",

I also apologised to those people who are not at the proceedings today, to me it is wider than just the representation today.  It is about the community out there, the Athlone Community, the children who could not go to school the next morning and the disruption that happened as a result of it and I know it is very difficult for the people to understand why we acted in the way that we did but it was in a situation of an undeclared war.

It is regrettable that this happened, it happened on the other hand, it is part of our history and we cannot change it.  I am today very glad and I hear that as many of you will say and it is often spoken about warfare and I know I was part of a warfare system.  War is not the solution, it is not a solution for any country or for any problem and I am a lot wiser than I was ten years ago, I support what is happening in the country, I support it one hundred percent and naturally there are processes and there are things that happened that one doesn't totally agree with but everyone can have his own opinion but in principle I have not problem and I will never ever again and I am on record as saying this, I will never ever again avail myself for any government organisation or any other organisation whatever the case may be to do what I did ten years ago.",
