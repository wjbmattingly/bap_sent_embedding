I received information over the weekend that indicated that that which I said was not quite the truth, or that it did not happen exactly like I said it happened.  Can I just explain this to you in short.\n\tIt is with regard to the applications that the CCB brought to me under my detention under Section 29, and I said that the funds for them were given in cash to Calla Botha, and I testified about it and I was under the impression that that's how it worked, but after certain discussions with my father telephonically, I found out that it did not work like that.  \n\tThe money was given to Scholtz and Botha, an attorney's firm from Florida and they contacted my father and told him that the costs have been covered.  Additional to this, R4 000 was given to Brenda Mills, my girlfriend whom I shared a house with and they provided her with that amount of money every month.  There were certain enquiries made about what her costs were and what she needed.  It was approximately R4 000 that they gave to her every month.  This was given by a firm Weavind and Weavind, situated in Pretoria.  They handed over the cash to my father who then wrote out cheques to Brenda Mills, not to make it traceable and this was a Werner Burchill from the attorney's firm Weavind and Weavind.  That's all that I'd like to say concerning this.",

He was the Head of the CCB, who came to me and told me exactly what I must do, but when he saw something that could possibly be a conviction or a charge against him, he drove to the Attorney-General to make a statement.  And these are the same people who are recces who kill hundreds of people and even if it's a greenpeace overall that they find, they'll still run to the Attorney-General to testify against their comrades.\n\tIt was these people who were our recces.  If tomorrow he ends up in a war situation and to protect our loved ones, then I'd say Sir, that person who is the big recce guy would sell us out for a tin of bully-beef.  I have got no respect for them.  The same counts for the politicians.  \n\tIt's not about getting out of jail now or prison, I just want them to recognise me.  I want them to say, \"yes I know this person\", as Siphiwe Nyanda did.  Where's the threat?  There's no more threat for these people, but they are still not doing it.  The Bible says you have to forgive seventy times seven.  I feel about it in this way, Kevin Woods and Eugene de Kock feel the same way, but they still deny it.  We did everything on our own.  Eugene de Kock took 18 people and attacked Lesotho.  And the morning I woke up and I threw names in a hat and I pulled it out and I thought I'll kill David Webster today.

With regard to Lafras Luitingh and Joe Verster there was a typical CCB conspiracy against me after Joe had walked the whole way with me.  You will remember that I was contacted by means of Mr Luitingh and I was brought to the Braamfontein Protea Hotel and a document was shown to me and the effect of the words which were typed on that page were that he denied any knowledge or involvement of or in the matter.  He pointed at it with his finger and told me that that was his attitude.  \n\tAll of those things built up to the time that I was arrested.  All along everyone denied everything and all of a sudden Joe Verster and the others incriminated me during the post-mortem inquest.  I didn't have someone in the system, such as Calla Botha or Slang van Zyl who could support me.

And if I were to disclose or expose everything in an amnesty application, all the Defence Force had to do was to deny it, which is what they did.  Theuns Kruger said: \"I don't know what the man's talking about, come and look at my office, I'm an auditor, look at my books\" and there I would be and then there would be allegations and incriminations against me and the chances were very good that they would turn around and testify against me again if charges were brought against me.  \n\tI had absolutely no substantiation.

I recruited criminal elements to disrupt mass actions and marches, I recruited them to commit criminal offences.  If they participated in these marches, then the government or the Defence Force would then give it a lot of media coverage.  They would run down a street, damage vehicles, break shop windows.  I personally paid these criminal elements.\n\tMaybe you can recall that there were such allegations in the media and on television that the ANC held a march and people ran down the streets and people robbed shops and people were injured, and I paid those, half before and half afterwards.  I think in two of those incidents, as I just explained it to you, we decided to stage a false one and this was done to strengthen the Defence Force hand in terms of actions in the Coloured areas, concerning roadblocks, house to house searches, etcetera.  Then we entered false information into the system, it was given to the media, in that we received information that, for example members of the ANC who were involved in these marches will hijack white women, take them to black areas to rape them.  We'd already built up a background with regards to the criminal elements in these marches.  \n\tAnd then you'd recall that it was given a lot of media coverage, helicopters were used, an operational office was set up and manned by a General, they held roadblocks, the did block searches, house to house searches because of this, and it was all a campaign against the ANC.

Because I was aware of sensitive connections with the Zulus, amongst others, with Themba Khoza and Vlakplaas.  I also had an IFP member that handled him who was a former Vlakplaas member and I do not recall specifically why he did not go with them, but they left there to go and pick up weapons and to take it to Tokoza in the East Rand to a hostel where they had to drop it off.
