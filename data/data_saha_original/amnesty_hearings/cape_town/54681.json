It was proposed to call a certain witness today, but, unfortunately, it has emerged that he has not been offered, he had not been afforded an opportunity to consult a legal adviser before a statement was taken from him, nor was he afforded that opportunity in the light of the fact that he is one of the persons implicated in the present proceedings and, in terms of the Act, is entitled to legal advice.  We, unfortunately, had to try to make arrangements this morning and that has been done and I think it is, all the lawyers concerned agree that it is a case where he is, should have and be improper to proceed without affording him the opportunity of taking legal advice.  That means that we will not be able to conclude this hearing today, because it has not been possible to arrange for a lawyer to make himself available and to investigate the position fully in order to advise his client.\n\tWe will, however, proceed now with the continuing cross-examination of the second applicant and thereafter it will be necessary to adjourn this hearing to a date to be arranged.  \nCROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR B WILLIAMS (cont)",
