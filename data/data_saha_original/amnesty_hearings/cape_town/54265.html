<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We continue with the hearing.  When we adjourned yesterday, it was for Mr Williams to put any questions he may have, to Gen Webb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">EDWARD WEBB:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Williams?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>MR WILLIAMS</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>	Thank you.  Mr Chairperson, I think I have been covered to a great extent, by Mr Bizos.  I have got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>NO FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR WILLIAMS</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Williams.  Mr Hockey?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOCKEY:</span> I've got no questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR HOCKEY</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr du Plessis, do you have any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> Certain aspects, Mr Chairman.  General, arising from the questions from the side of the Committee, I get the impression that the Committee finds it strange that you are presented as the Commanding Officer of Special Forces, but you don't take the trouble to study the files of personnel and about all the authorisations, could you please explain to the Committee what the situation was at that stage in the country, and what your position was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Mr Chairperson, to sketch the situation in the country, in October 1984 the President, he had already employed the South African Defence Force, there was a State of Emergency in October, October 1985 and in June 1986.  In the publications of the State of Emergency, there was many additional powers given to the Special Forces, which showed how serious the situation was internally.  The country was burning.  We still had to act, we could not end our operations.  As far as my own situation is concerned, it came from a conventional power, we had to adapt against anti-insurgents, but above that, there was Special Forces and that is a further fine tuning of these anti-insurgent operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>	Furthermore, I had to brief myself as far as covert operations were concerned, something that was completely new to me.  There was no course in the Army as far as covert operations were concerned.  My own priorities with Special Forces was firstly the uniform part, established units, busy with operations, operations planning, my second priority was the CCB externally which was also established, busy with operations, planning of new operations and CCB internally as third priority.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>	The workload, all the regiments had to brief me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> The regiments did not come to you, you had to go to them and it took a lot of time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> The CCB had to brief me, I had to visit certain places.  I was also involved in meetings with the general staff.  Tasks emerging from those meetings, there were also visitors from overseas we had to handle and I also had various social responsibilities that I had to see to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>	If I look at matters now with hindsight, then I was actually dealing with a crisis management situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> The terrorist war or struggle as we knew it at that stage, did not grind to a halt to give you the opportunity to first reorientate yourself and establish yourself and familiarise yourself with your now posts, it actually escalated in intensity and continued?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> The CCB, you have already testified, was just a small part of Special Forces?  How many Regions were there of the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> If I remember correctly, there were nine Regions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> You have also testified before the Committee that you met with Col Verster for about an hour per week, specifically dealing with the CCB aspect of Special Forces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> On average, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> If you take the nine Regions and I calculate correctly, it relates to about six and a half minutes per Region, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> And then you further have the situation that of those nine Regions, eight were established Regions, with many projects on the go which perhaps you would have to discuss in more detail than Region 6, which was only in its infancy, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> Would I be correct in saying that more time would be devoted to the other Regions, than to Region 6?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, more to Special Forces Uniform and then to the eight Regions and then Region 6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> In Region 6, there was no necessity to report to you before something had materialised, which could be made into some kind of a project?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> (Microphone not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, if you can just watch the leading aspect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Really, we must have some (microphone not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> Would there have been any reason for Mr Verster to report regarding Region 6, to you in detail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> If any monitoring had been authorised by him, he wouldn't have to report to me about the monitoring.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> If the monitoring had required something else which was to develop into an operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR H DU PLESSIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Sibanyoni, do you have any questions that you would like to ask Mr Webb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson.  General, the period when, I will say the transition before Jaap Joubert left and you took over, you said there was a period when you were together, were you sort of in a situation of an office, sitting together in an office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Some of the times, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And what would be your duties during that period when you were with him, was it the full orientation or was it ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It was to orientate myself, I had no responsibilities at that stage, just for orientation of myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Where was that office situated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> In Pretoria, at the Headquarters of Special Forces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Are you aware or do you understand the requirements of this Act, that the Commission has to establish as full a picture as possible of the conflict of the past?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Would you say you have told the Commission everything in so far as the policies, the procedures of the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I think I have, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You are aware that there will be no other opportunity or platform in the future, to talk about this, is the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Lax?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you Chairperson.   Did I understand your evidence correctly that during this hand-over phase, that Gen Joubert didn't brief you on any current operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And that wasn't because there weren't any on the go, he just didn't brief you on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, I was taken to the Regiments, and they briefed me on the operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So, in his hand-over to you, during that month when you were sitting with him, trying to understand what your new job was going to entail, he didn't take you through any of the projects that were ongoing, he didn't take you through for example this new Region 6 and say "this is what we intend to do, this is what is has been established for, this is what it is likely to be doing"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, again, I was briefed by Gen Verster regarding Region 6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So, did Verster give you a complete briefing of all the operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And that included Region 6?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That included Region 6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did it include what their planning was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, what perhaps could have been foreseen for the future.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> It would have included their global budget?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Because they had a most peculiar way of budgeting, they wrote off their funds in advance?    You already told us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, a year ahead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Budgeted a year ahead, which was quite unusual.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Precisely.  Without any actual projects in mind, particularly with regard to Region 6, you allocate however much money for that purpose and then the Auditor-General approves it and then you go ahead and spend it without, as if it had been approved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, there were also other measures in place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I think once a month there was a financial report given from the CCB financial staff, to the Financial Department of Special Forces, and then in that once a month report, funds were requested by the CCB, from Special Forces.  It wasn't a global amount which was given on a once off basis to the CCB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Who was responsible for giving those financial reports?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> The financial person involved in the CCB, he had that responsibility.  My Senior Staff Officer at Finance at Special Forces, he also had that responsibility, and in my time, I also appointed a person to also act as an intermediary in a way to just see that the funds were allocated correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Who were these three people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> The person at CCB, well, I don't know his name, I did meet him.  My own Senior Staff of Finance, I cannot remember his name, and the person that I appointed, was a retired man, a Brig Pheil.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How would you spell Pheil.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> P-h-e-i-l, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did you appoint Brig Pheil with specific authority to vet the accounts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> To do a small audit before it came to my people at Special Forces Headquarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So he was the check on the CCB's own finance people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> He was the intermediary check.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes.  And what were his specific instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> He had to see to the fact that the funds flowed properly, as approved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> He also testified before the Harms Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see, we have heard of moneys being budgeted, take for example the Early Learning Centre, we know that it must have been in excess of R30 000-00 because the R30 000-00 was what was intended to be paid to the operative who placed the bomb.  You have heard that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, I have heard that evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And in addition to that, there were transport, accommodation and all sorts of other costs that were incurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>	Let's just for argument sake say it was R40 000-00, what checks did you have, or would Brig Pheil have had, in terms of knowing that for argument's sake, that Mr Burger didn't pocket R5 000-00 as is alleged in these papers?  I don't know whether that is true or not, obviously, but that is just the allegation.  How would he know that the money was pocketed or not pocketed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> There was a financial plan in existence, it was laid down in a document, it said how these funds should be spent and how it should be accounted for, there were built in measures.  Although there was a bit of a dip as far as that was concerned vis-a-vis other covert funds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>	What these control measures was, I cannot remember exactly, perhaps an operation was approved and then that would require my signature, Verster's signature and perhaps the Regional Manager's signature.  If something had been approved on Verster's level, it would require his and the Regional Manager's signatures.   If it was something that only Verster could approve, it would require his signature only, but these were the security or control measures which were laid down in the document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Okay.   So, nobody signed vouchers for what they spent as far as you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I don't know.  The operation itself would have determined that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You never received any reports, or did you receive any reports that funds were not being allocated correctly, or not being spent correctly or not being accounted for correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, I never received such reports.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Would you have expected to receive such a report if that was the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And then just, let me just check here, there was one other aspect.  I am still a little puzzled and you will indulge me if I am covering ground that has already been covered, and forgive me for that, but I am still not entirely clear in my own mind, how you actually weighed up the selection of targets, what were your specific criteria that you used in your own mind to decide "yes, this is a good project", it meets whatever criteria that you had, or "no, this is a bad target", it doesn't meet whatever those criteria are?  Are you able to just briefly give us the three or five or eight or whatever they might have been, kinds of criteria that you could have checked off in the back of your head as you thought about a target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> As far as internal operations are concerned, we can look at the bomb explosion at Athlone, what was said was that the source didn't want his identity disclosed with the consequence that the South African Police already fell out of the picture, and the fact that these people were planning acts of terrorism, the fact that they had already committed such acts in the past, information which indicated that actions were being launched against the State.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>	If it was an overseas target,  then it was the base where it was situated, who was at the base, what was being done, those were the relevant issues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And did you weigh up the potential benefits or negative consequences of the operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I am sure that went through one's mind, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr du Plessis, do you have any questions arising out of the questions that have been put by Members of the Panel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> No questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR DU PLESSIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wessels?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> No thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR WESSELS</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Martini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MARTINI:</span> Chairperson, if I may, just one question which I think arose through the cross-examination by Mr Bizos.   Thank you Chairperson.  Gen Webb, according to your evidence, you received information from Mr Verster regarding a particular project, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> The way I understand your evidence is that you weren't given any documentation relating to a particular project, or were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Not in this case, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Well, in the Early Learning Centre project, were you given a copy of the plan, the "pre-study"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You are aware that in that matter, Mr van Zyl had to do a "pre-study"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I am aware of it now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Sorry, correct, at this point in time, are you aware of that, you heard his evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> And you are also aware that an "in-house" would have to take place after that "pre-study", where you wouldn't be present, the "first in-house"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Would you agree with me that Mr van Zyl would have more knowledge of the particular plan than possibly you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> You mean with the execution of the whole thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, because he was on the ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Correct, and he would have more knowledge possibly of what the objectives were with that plan than what you had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Why the objectives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Well, he prepared the plan and the way I understand the evidence, they had to have an "in-house" to discuss it and thereafter that proposal would come up to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> He would possibly have been able to add something to the plan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Mr Verster would then report to you on that plan, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Is it possible that Mr Verster might not have given you all the finer details of that plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It is possible, the thing was discussed very, very quickly, we had to make a quick decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, can I just intervene for a second.   Isn't it so that you saw this as an opportunistic target, you didn't even know that there was a plan, you didn't even know there was a project?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Nobody told you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That is right, as I said that is the knowledge that I have now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, but at the time you had no idea that these chaps had done a "pre-study", that there had been "in-houses", nobody related that to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Correct, you had no knowledge of that?  Now, Mr van Zyl's evidence was that one of the objectives in using a limpet mine, was that where it blew up, it would create the impression that this was a bomb used by the Youth  Movement, it was one of their own bombs that exploded, the police would come on the scene and start suspecting "why was this bomb here in the first place, why had this bomb gone off".  Were you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, I wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Now, Mr van Zyl prepared the plan, are you able to dispute that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, I cannot dispute it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So then yesterday when you answered that it was not to create, make it appear that the bomb was left by the organisation, wasn't totally correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> My order was to the effect that the bomb had to explode as soon as possible, so that these people could be intimidated and frightened off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>	What was decided on the ground finally, that I am not aware of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> But yesterday Mr Bizos put to you, he said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>"... so this bomb, it wasn't intended to make it appear that it was left by the Kewtown Youth Movement",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>	and you conceded that, that concession is not totally correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> If the Kewtown Youth Movement had their own bomb exploding while they were in the hall, this really is stupid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> What is stupid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That their bomb is exploding while they are in the hall or just leaving the hall, to me that is not, it doesn't make common sense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Mr van Zyl says that that was what the intention was, to create that impression, that one of their own bombs in the building went off, the police would come on the scene and start asking questions "well, why is the bomb here in the first place, what is going on"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That is possible that that is Mr van Zyl's perception, but it wasn't my impression.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Mr van Zyl says that that was one of the objectives, can you dispute that?  Can you dispute his evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I don't know what was told to Mr van Zyl on the ground, so I cannot dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You cannot dispute it, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Mr Sibanyoni wants to ask another questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Gen Webb, if you were told this project, the object is to make the bomb to appear as if it was left by the Kewtown Youth Movement, would you have approved it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Depending on how this plan would have been put in front of me.  If we had to discredit them in that way, it is quite possible, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But as you are sitting now, you think that would have been stupid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Well, that was not my, it wasn't my order.  What happened lower down the ranks, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you General, that concludes your testimony, you may stand down now.</p>
