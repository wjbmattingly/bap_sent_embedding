Now it is clear as I understand the provisions of Section 31, my Lord, members of the Committee, that evidence tendered at a Committee in the course of their proceedings could be inadmissible, provided it does not fall within the proviso to sub-section 3 of Section 31.\n\tThe problem of Mr Mbane, my Lords, members of the Committee, is that there was no application for amnesty and there is...the act does not prohibit the Attorney General from indeed instituting prosecution against Mr Mbane and in the context of that...of that possibility, that real possibility, that it is submitted that an order might have to be made by the Committee with regard to the evidence which might be elicited either through examination in chief, or through cross examination.  Because from the statement, whether it be in the form as contained in volume 2, or in the form as it is indicated and reflected in the original document, it is clearly, it is clear from that that those evidence or facts would conforms to what is referred to in Section 31, sub-section 2(c) of the Act, where it is, and it reads thus my Lords and members of the Commission:\n\"A person referred to in sub-section 1 shall only be compelled to answer a question or to produce an article which may incriminate him or her if the Commission has issued an order to that effect.\"\nAnd then the objective jurisdictional requirement, as I understand it, my Lords members of the Commission, after the Commission firstly has consulted with the Attorney General who has jurisdiction, and has satisfied itself that to require such information from such a person is reasonable, necessary and justifiable in an open and democratic society based on freedom and equality, and has satisfied itself that such a person has refused or is likely to refuse to answer a question or produce an article on the grounds that such an answer or article might incriminate him or her.\n\tNow it seems to me with respect, my Lords and members of the Committee, and I might be wrong, that in order for Mr Mbane to invoke only the privilege of his evidence not being admissible against him in criminal proceedings should it follow, an order at least is required to be issued by this Committee.  That in any event, it seems to me and it is submitted with respect, would not preclude the Attorney General to institute criminal proceedings.

Whilst they went away, I went to meet Belletjies at a hotel in Seapoint where they had booked in a room and I found them there and explained everything to them.\n\tI told them that there was going to be a problem because these people were fully trained and they want action and wanted to hit this kombi.

It was at about 7'o clock because that kombi goes past that place at about 7:25 every morning.\n\tI tried to make sure that our kombi did not start, but unfortunately, we had a mechanic and he fixed that small problem and we managed to drive off.
