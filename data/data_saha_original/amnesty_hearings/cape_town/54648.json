Our \nposition is still that we would like to cross-examine the \napplicants, most certainly if it is intended to call Mr Coetzee as a \nwitness and we would like the Committee to make a ruling on \nthat.  There are a couple of reasons Mr Chairman why I submit  \ncross-examination should be allowed. Firstly the version of Mr \nCoetzee has never been tested in a scenario where any other \nperson has admitted any involvement in the murder of Kondile and \nthat in itself makes these hearings completely different to any of \nthe other hearings that have taken place relating to this incident \nand I submit that there are various aspects on which Mr Coetzee's \nevidence at this stage, considering the new allegations or the new \nfacts presented by these applicants can assist this committee to \ncome to the truth.  I may just mention one fact for instance is the \nincrimination of a Mr Roy Otto, that's the first time that we hear \nof his involvement.  Now other than the fact that this person is \ndeceased, Mr Chairman, the facts of the matter are that there is \ndocumentation available which suggested that Mr Otto was on \nleave at the time, in fact had been on leave for a month and a \nhalf, which gives credence to the suggestion that there is \nsomething sinister in the choice of a dead person to be the person \nshooting or committing the actual killing.

I think it's quite clear that the Committees \nare waiting to hear all the evidence before bringing out some \nfindings.  Now if there is a ruling that the evidence led here will \nnot  affect that application, then you are completely correct and \nthat was in fact our position right at the start.  However there \nwas a very clear indication last time and I accept that the \nCommittee is comprised differently this time, but there was a very \nclear indication that his evidence is very necessary and that these \nissues are considered, the differences are considered as material \ndisputes and would have to be canvassed.  -  As it pleases.",
