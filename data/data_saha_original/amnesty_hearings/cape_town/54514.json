The Kewtown Youth Movement held a meeting in the hall a few metres from where the bomb was planted, that approximately ten to eight you called me from a meeting and we had a discussion.  Some of the Kewtown Youth Movement members came out and there was a disagreement between you and some of the members.  You then exited the building through the front entrance.  Because of the interaction with you and some of the youth we decided to end the meeting earlier than usual, so shortly afterwards we adjourned.\n\tSome of the Kewtown Youth Movement members then left the hall through the front entrance of the building and at the same time members of the Cape Youth Congress appeared or arrived and asked if they can also use the hall for a meeting.  I then used my discretion and I said yes.  We were in the hall and we were planning to have the meeting in the hall when the Principal of the ELC arrived and he warned us and said we cannot use the hall because the soccer people were supposed to use the hall.\n\tWe then left the hall and went to the boardroom section and approximately ten minutes later the bomb exploded and the whole time, in this time that I've just talked about, there were soccer members who were in the entrance hall.  So in the front of the building there were people.  Is there any aspect that I've just put to you, can you dispute any of them?",
