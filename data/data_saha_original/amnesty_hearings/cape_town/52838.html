<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I stay at Molteno in the Eastern Cape in number 1184 in New Location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> How long have you now been in the army, in the Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I started on the 1st of July this year, 1998.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Before July 1998, what was your status, what was your position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I was in prison.  I was released on the 3rd of June.  I received amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> In respect of which offence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> It's about the Newcastle Crazy Disco Attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> When did that attack happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> That was in 1994 on the 14th of February.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> That attack is also mentioned by you in your amnesty application, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Just for the record, Chairperson, I refer to page 32 of the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>	Did you go to school Walter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> A little bit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> What do you mean by a little bit, until what standard did you go to school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I went up until standard two.  Due to some problems in the family I couldn't go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> When did you leave school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> It was in 1972.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> In 1972.  And since 1972, what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I was doing nothing, I was just sitting at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Did you become involved in politics at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> And when was that?  When did you become involved in politics for the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> That was in 1982.  In 1990 I became - In 1982 I was involved with the PAC and then in 1990 I became the member of the Azanian People's Liberation Army.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> How did you become involved with what is referred to as APLA?  How did you become involved?  Did you join out of your own, were you asked to join?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I was recruited and I was also satisfied because I could see that that was a way for me to fight for liberation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Is the reason why you joined APLA, or tell us why you joined APLA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> The reason for me to join APLA, I realised that the African land was taken from them and they were victims and they were being oppressed.  They were victimised by the South African Police and even the South African Defence Force was victimising them.  So I saw the need for me to get involved with the APLA and be part of the people who are going to liberate Africa, to protect, to liberate Africans from the apartheid regime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> And how were you going to do that, how were you going to liberate the African people from the regime?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I had to obey the orders from the commander of APLA and be involved in the operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Okay.  Now tell us about the - the operations that you were involved in, we know now you were involved in the New Caste Crazy Beat Disco matter, where you applied for amnesty and you have been granted amnesty.  We know about that one.  Now the others in respect of which you are applying for amnesty are some of the ones we are going to deal with today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>	Now before we do that, can you just perhaps tell the Committee, you were born in the Eastern Cape, did you at any stage come to Cape Town?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I once came to Cape Town when I was deployed here in 1990 although I was born in the Eastern Cape in Molteno.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Who deployed you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> The only names that I know is Mzala, Mandla and Jones.  Those were the names that I was using, we were using for the comrade who deployed me here in Cape Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Are those three different comrades or they one and the same person, this Mandla, Power, Jones or are they different persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> It's one person but we were using different code names.  For security reasons we were using different code names for one person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> When is the last time that you saw this person who has these various names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And by what name are we going to be referring to him here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> When last did you Mandla, Power, Mzala or Jones?  You've said they are one and the same person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I last saw him in 1994, in 1994 when he was giving me instructions to go to Natal in Newcastle.  After that I was arrested, I couldn't see him again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Now when you were deployed to Cape Town or to come to Cape Town, what were your instructions?  Can you tell us what your instructions were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> The instruction was to recruit Africans and establish APLA units and train comrades for the task force, the task force that would defend the members of the PAC and to ensure no enemies infiltrate the PAC, and to ensure that the APLA soldiers who are coming, I should welcome those and make sure that the operations here in Cape Town are going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Were you also instructed to carry out any operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> When you instructed to carry out operations, who were to be the targets?  The operations were to be carried out against whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Our targets were people like the SAP, SADF and whites because those were the people who were oppressing the Africans.  As everyone knows about this history of South Africa, that the land of the Africans were taken from the Africans.  We never had rights as Africans in South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> The targets, whose task was it to identify the targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> The commander of the unit was the one who would take a decision about the target to be attacked and monitor that target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> So these targets which we're going to deal with now, would it be correct that you were responsible for identifying them as targets, in your capacity as unit commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Now let's deal with the first one: The Khayelitsha Police Vehicle Attack in Zolo Budd Road or Drive, I think it's also referred to.  This happened towards the end of 1992, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> You were involved in the attack with someone by the name of Mtura: M-T-U-R-A, and together with Gcinikhaya Makoma, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Tell us about the attack, how did it come about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> The two people here, Mtura and one comrade and the third comrade was Gcinikhaya Makoma.  Mtura came in the company of one comrade.  When they came I had to contact Mzala as my commander.  I wanted to know what was happening.  I wanted to know whether these comrades were here to work in Cape Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>	I later realised that they were supposed to work in the area of Transvaal.  Mtura said these comrades should go.  They were to be involved in an operation and leave Cape Town thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which comrade was supposed to go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> It was Mtura and one other comrade, I don't know his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but you said: "Mtura said that these comrades should go".</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> It is Mandla who said I must involve them in an operation.  It's Mandla who was my commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> So do I understand you correctly that Mtura and one other person came to your house and Mandla then instructed you to involve the two of them in this particular operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> That is correct, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> So it would have been you, Mtura, the other person who is not known to you, and Makoma.  The four of you were involved in this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Were all of them members of APLA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Mtura and the other comrade were a members of APLA and Gcinikhaya Makoma was still receiving training from the task force.  He was a very disciplined person and also obedient.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> How did Makoma become involved in this operation?  Was he also instructed by Mzala or did you instruct him, how did he get involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I'm the person who instructed him to be involved, to get involved because we needed a person who was going to give a signal when the other people would be busy doing something else.  Makoma and the other comrade were there to give a signal whenever the police van was coming from the bushes.  If it's coming from Makoma's side, therefore he would give a signal and if it was coming from the direction of the other comrade the other comrade would also give a signal because we wouldn't see it coming.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> So the operation was to attack a police van, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> You attacked the van with weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Tell us about the weapons used during this attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I used an R4 rifle, Mtura had an R4 rifle and I gave Gcinikhaya Makoma an AK47 and I gave the other comrade an AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> And just tell us about the operation itself, did it take place, what time of the day did it take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> It was late in the night.  I'm not sure about the time, but it was late in the night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> And did you fire on the van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, I shot at the vehicle and Mtura did so, though my firearm locked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> So was it only you and Mtura who shot at the van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> What was the purpose of the attack, why did you attack the van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> The purpose, we wanted to hit the police van and when it stops and I would issue an order to those people who were therefore signal, I would order them to disarm these police so as to get more weapons for the other soldiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> When you shot at the van did the van stop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> No, it did not stop because my firearm locked when it was supposed to release the third bullet.  So the operation was not successful because the van couldn't stop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> So you regarded this as an unsuccessful operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Did you report the operation to the APLA High Command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, after that I phoned Mzala and I told him about this operation and I told him that the operation was not successful.  I told him that Mtura and the other comrade left Cape Town.  They left Cape Town the following day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> And what happened to Makoma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> After the operation I released Gcinikhaya Makoma to go back to his family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Was Makoma from Cape Town?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, he was residing at Site C.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Do you know what happened - you shot at the van, do you know whether - I take it you hit the van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, though I'm not sure whether anyone was injured but I'm sure that no-one died there during that attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry Mr Arendse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>	Mr Tanda, did the shots hit the body of the police vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You fired two shots, then you AK47 locked, is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> It locked when it was supposed to release the third bullet, my firearm locked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Mtura had also fired a shot at the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Walter, were you charged criminally with this particular offence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Did you go to court for it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> No, I never appeared but I am the one who released that information when I was filling in the application form.  I was never charged for the offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Maybe we can just move on then to the next offence in respect of which you seek amnesty.  This is the Cross Roads Police Attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>	Now your orders you received from Mzala, is that correct?  Directly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> For this particular attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I got order from Mzala because I used to connect with him telephonically and he said I must involve Africans in operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Did it also include the Cross Roads Police Attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Now is it correct that you carried out this particular attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I do not want to say the attack was successfully carried out but I must say that there were people who were killed because the intention of the attack was to disarm those people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Now you were accompanied during this attack by other persons, who were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I was with Simon and Graham.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Do you know them by any other name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> When is the last time you saw either or both of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> After that I used to meet them and I last saw them in 1993 when I left Cape Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> They're not here today, just for the record?  They're not here today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, they are not here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Where did you meet them?  I'm coming back to before the attack now, where did you meet them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> They were Africans that I used to work with, that is Graham and another member.  We used to train under ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Were they members of your unit or were they from some other unit or were they deployed to Cape Town to assist you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> No, they were under my command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> In your unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> When - you said earlier that you were, as commander of the unit you were responsible for identifying the targets, was this particular attack also as a result of your identification of the target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> It is I who identified the target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Now the target in this case were two policeman or what you thought were policemen, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> And this particular incident happened not far from the Cross Roads police Station, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Why did you think that the two person you attacked were policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> You see policemen use a uniform and their uniform is different to other uniforms.  The general public do not wear uniforms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Chairperson, just for the record, if the Committee peruses the police docket in this matter, it appears from the photographs in the docket that both the deceased were wearing blue coloured uniforms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>	Now these two policemen, they were not in a vehicle, they were walking, they were on foot, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Where were they walking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> In front of other some shacks, moving from the direction of the police station of Cross Roads.  When I saw them I said we must go between the shacks and Graham and Simon must be on the side of the police station with the intention to have someone giving me some firing cover, in order to prevent policemen who might appear later, from assassinating me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>	They came on as they were moving on foot and they were within reach of my fire.  When they were within reach I then shot at them with an AK47.  When they fell I said to Graham he must disarm them.  We gave Graham firing cover and when that happened a kombi appeared and it lit directly in our direction, that is where I said: "Let us withdraw", because I was avoiding a situation of us being identified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Now ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> ...[no English translation]  to avoid the people in the kombi identifying us because it had lit on us at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Why did you shoot at these policemen, were they armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> You see a policeman in uniform, it becomes a very unusual thing that he walks around without his weapon whilst he is in uniform.  The uniform is also - you wear a uniform plus your firearm generally, that's what I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question was, you told Graham to disarm them, did Graham disarm them?  Did he recover or get any arms from them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> No, he could not get any weapons from them because when that happened a kombi appeared and then I said we must retreat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> So you don't know whether they were in fact armed or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> That is correct.  As I've said, to a policeman his uniform is together with his firearm and I saw that there were people coming from the police station in uniform, I thought they must be armed as they are on duty.  They were on duty at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Now after the attack you, Graham was unable to search them and find out whether in fact they had arms, what did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> We returned to the house we used.  If I want to see somebody I would use that house as a shack(?) point.  That is where we returned to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Where was this house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> At Site C.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> At Site C in Khayelitsha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> I'm not sure whether it's still the case, but at the time it was a squatter camp, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> It is still a shack place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Now do you know what happened to these policemen or these two persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> You see, the following day I woke up the following morning and went to where this attack occurred and I looked around and I noticed that indeed two policemen were lying there and the public had gathered there and investigation officers were on the scene.  After that I reported the matter, the whole operation to Mzala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> What did you say to Mzala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I told him that two policemen had passed away in that operation and that that operation can be claimed under APLA, though the weapons and the ammunition used could not be retrieved from the policemen because we were disturbed by that kombi that lit on us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry Mr Arendse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>	That kombi, the kombi you're talking about, did it come and stop there at the scene where these police were shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> It was on the road.  The driver stopped the kombi and lit directly at the area where this whole operation was on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Yes, but it came and passed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> No, it did not pass, it stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A bit strange isn't it?  This happened late at night, the kombi arrives, they see policemen shot, they do nothing about it, because the next morning you go there and the policemen are still lying there.  That is strange isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, it may surprise you, though I do not know why those people did not go and report this matter and why those policemen were still lying on the road even the following morning.  I would not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> This shack Mr Tanda, you say you went back to, was some sort of a hide-out for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, it was a place I used.  Even before we go on operations, that is where we meet to discuss and then from there we move to whatever scene of operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How far was that shack from the place where the police had been shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Site C is at Khayelitsha and the policemen were attacked at Cross Roads, next to the Cross Roads Police Station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You mean to say that the - I want to be sure that I understand you clearly, you mean to say that the shack was far from the scene where the police had been shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> The place where the police fell, was that a public road?  The road where you shot the policemen, was that a public road or a private road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, it was a footpath but where you could use a car also because it was an open veld of sorts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did it have lights or was it dark in that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> There are lights at Cross Roads, that's why I could see them from a distance and said we must hide, using a shack as our cover.  And where we were there was no bright lighting.  It was darkish but you could see someone from a distance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How did you see the colour and type of uniform these two people were wearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I saw it when these people were in the street between the houses made of bricks, going towards the direction of the shacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say: "street", is that the same thing that you talked about as a footpath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> If you can see the police station at Cross Roads there is a street from the police station and then a street going this way towards the houses made of bricks.  There is a street that crosses towards the shacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The point was this that I heard the word: "footpath" being given as the place where the shooting was done.  Was it a footpath which was sometimes used by motorcars as you said, or is it a street that is well lit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I said when I answered this question, that people on foot can walk on it, even a person can use a car to drive because it's an open field of sort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it is not a street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> No, it is not a street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Mr Tanda, were you watching these two persons for while, and if so for how long were you watching them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I saw them when they were approaching, going over this open veld like place.  As I had my weapon on my body when they were coming I took cover with the shacks with the intent to position myself properly so that when they appear nearer to us I can then use my weapon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> When you saw them for the first time, were they walking in a street where you could see them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> And the street itself, was it, did it have lights?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, there are very long poles at Cross Roads that light up the location.  Where they were coming from they have those lights, that's how I could see they were wearing police uniforms, and then I positioned myself between the shacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> So would it be correct to say that you observed them for a good few minutes before you decided to attack them at or near the footpath which the Chairperson is referring to and to which you referred to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, I did look at them for some time but it is not a long time.  I could then prepare myself to tell these Africans how they must position themselves in preparation of an attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Were you the only one who shot at the two persons involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, myself alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Are you sure that none of Simon or Graham shot at them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, I'm certain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did they tell you that Mr Tanda, did they say to you they did not open fire at these two policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> As I say, they gave me firing cover.  This means they were keeping watch over my back.  It is - the target was in front of me alone, it was I who was in close range with the target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were the identities of these two victims ever revealed to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> You mean, what do you mean Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Their names, where they come from, details of that kind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> No, I only got to know that they were policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Mr Tanda, is it correct that we also know now that of the two, only one was a policeman and the other one was an employee of Spoornet and that information you got from your legal representatives after they went through the police docket?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Correct, I got that information from my attorney.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Chairperson, just for the record, it also appears from the photographs that the deceased is still clothed in a Spoornet uniform which is also a blue uniform but which has a distinctive yellow Spoornet marking on the left shoulder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>	Mr Tanda, were you arrested at all in connection with this particular incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Did you appear in court in connection with the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How soon after this incident were you arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I was arrested in 1994, in February 1994  during the attack of Crazy Disco at Newcastle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Now you appeared in court in connection with this case several times in Mitchells Plain Court, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> And the case was withdrawn against you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What about your two colleagues, were they also arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> No, they were not arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And when was the case withdrawn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I cannot remember the date but it was during 1995.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you in custody throughout that period or where you on bail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I had been sentenced for 25 years for the case I had done at Newcastle and the case at Cape Town was a further charge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see.  So what you're really saying is whilst that other case involved you, you were making appearances in this matter here and the case was withdrawn.  I see.  Alright, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Why was it withdrawn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I cannot answer the question on behalf of the one who acquitted me, who withdrew the case.  I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> You were not given a reason why the case was withdrawn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> What I noticed during the whole time of my appearance in court was that those who led the case, the investigators and so on, they did not go to court.  I think therefore that that could be the reason why the case was withdrawn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Maybe Mr Arendse can help us there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> I'm afraid I can't.  Presumably because by that time Mr Tanda had already been found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in connection with the Newcastle matter and I take it the investigators didn't think that it's worthwhile pursuing the matter any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, proceed please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Chairperson, just for the record, it also appears from the docket that an inquest was held into the deaths of the two persons involved and the finding was that the inquest court couldn't find on the evidence who the person or person responsible was or were for the deaths of these two persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>	Mr Tanda, how do you - you're now sitting here in 1998, this incident happened towards the end of 1992, you killed human beings, two persons, one a policeman and one an employee of Spoornet.  We don't know but presumably they had family, wives, children, dependants, how do you feel about the fact that you killed these two persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Firstly, I want to say, regarding the victim who was walking with the policeman, if his family members or his dependants or wife or whosoever that I'm feeling very remorseful because the clothes he was wearing at the time looked very much like that of a policeman.  And to the family and his relatives I want to apologise.  The incident happened more because he was walking with a policeman.  I want to apologise to his family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>	Also to the policeman, although we know that the police during the time of apartheid, their families even though they were working, doing things against their nation, they understand that but I want to apologise to them and want to say that that time was a time of conflict, we were fighting against the government.  I think this time is a time of reconciliation and would ask their families to hold hands with us, and this is no more a time of conflict, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Mr Chairman, with your leave if I could move onto the next incident.  The next incident is the Khayelitsha Train Station Attack, with appears from pages 9 through to 23 of the bundle, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>	Were you involved in this attack at all Mr Tanda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> You are mentioned as part of this attack, did you know about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> No, I was not involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Did you know who was involved or who were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> You see, I was not part of the planning.  Even in the execution of the attack I was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Did you know the persons involved in the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, I knew Andile as Thabo, and I knew Chicken Licken as Chicken Licken, and I knew Maka Songe as DK.  I want to confirm that I know them as APLA members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> The last matter that I want to refer to is the one involving the Guguletu Police Attack at NY108.  Chairperson, it is not referred to specifically as one of the incidents before you.  If you look at the index on the front page, it is not one of the four incidents but it is mentioned by Mr Tanda in his application on page 32, paragraph 9(a) III.  There's reference there to Newcastle, which is the Newcastle Crazy Beat Disco matter, then the Khayelitsha, Zola Budd Road or Drive matter which we've dealt with, and then one sees 108 Road (Guguletu), and then plus Old Cross Road, which is the one which we've also dealt with already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Just for the record Mr Tanda, I'm just showing you a copy of your application, is that in your handwriting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> No, I was assisted by Mpahlele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Is the 108 Road that you see there, and in brackets (Guguletu), is the incident involving the attack on the police at NY108?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> The 108 issue - oh, the 108 is the road	 from Guguletu and connected the one to the airport through Nyanga Cross Roads and so on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Now is it correct that this particular attack or operation was carried out in January 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> You were in charge of a unit which comprised Shiceka, the person referred to by you as Chicken Licken and one, DK, and also a person by the name of Scorpion, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> The commander of the unit was Chicken Licken.  Oh, the one commanding Chicken Licken, DK and Scorpion was Andile Shiceka, the one I knew as Thabo at the time and Scorpion are involved in the operation because at the time I did not want to use people who were based in Cape Town in my unit.  So that when any person is wanted by the police that person would not be able to leave Cape Town easily.  So it is Andile Shiceka who ran the unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> But in the operation itself in January 1993, it was only you and Scorpion that were involved in the operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What about the other names that he mentioned, why are they mentioned then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Perhaps Mr Tanda, you can just repeat why the other names are mentioned to you, Shiceka, Chicken Licken and DK, why were they not involved in the actual operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> The reason, I only wanted someone to assist me as part of my manpower, I did not want a unit.  You see, the reason why all of these words are mentioned is because, so as to explain where Scorpion was coming from, which unit he was coming from.  All of them were my visitors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So to say that in January 1993, yourself, Shiceka, Chicken Licken, DK and Scorpion were involved, that's not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> DK, Chicken Licken and Andile were not there, it was myself and Scorpion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Is it - just to correct that because I probably put it wrongly to you, you were together as a group, you yourself, Shiceka, Chicken Licken and DK and Scorpion, you were together as a group but in terms of carrying out the operation it was only you and Scorpion who were involved in this particular operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Now, during this operation you attacked a yellow police van, is that correct, in NY108?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> What time of the day was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> It was late in the night.  I'm not sure about the time and the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Why did you attack the van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> The intention was to get arms as we knew that police were patrolling with arms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Did you decide to attack the van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes.  I am the one who took that decision, though I got the mandate from Mzala.  As I've already explained I was responsible for APLA soldiers who were coming.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>	I was there to welcome them and train them so as to be ready for the operation and I had to ensure that they were armed.  I would select the target to be disarmed.  I later heard that one policeman died, the one who was driving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> You were armed, were you armed with an AK47 or with an R4 rifle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I was armed with an R4 rifle and I gave another R4 rifle to Scorpion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Did both of you shoot at the van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> No, I'm the only one who shot at the van.  He was there to assist me if there was any resistance or shooting back.  Because in such an operation it is important not to act at the same time if it's not necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> So would it be correct to say that you take sole responsibility for the death of this one policeman during this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, that is correct.  Though the APLA have taken all the responsibility for any actions of APLA, but as the commander on that particular day, on this particular operation I'm taking the responsibility.  I am even prepared to meet with the families of the victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> How do you feel about what happened during this attack, now that you know that one policeman, probably a black policeman, was killed during that attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> As I've already said initially, I heard that something happened during apartheid regime but now it's a new era.  I am prepared to shake hands with the families of the victims because I know now that we are in the new era, we are no longer fighting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Were you arrested in connection with this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> When were you arrested and where were you when you were arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I was arrested in 1994 during the attack at Newcastle.  That was one of the cases that we used to appear in the Mitchell's Plain Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> So you also appeared in court in connection with this case on several occasions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> And this case too was withdrawn against you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Do you know why it was withdrawn against you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> As I was not in a position to explain that before, I can only speculate.  During the times of apartheid the lives of the black people didn't have any value.  Maybe that was one of the reasons because the police who were involved in that case didn't attend the court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does that mean that even black policemen didn't attach any value to black life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> The reason for me to say that, in this case of Newcastle ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Can the speaker please be requested to speak a little bit louder and in front of the mike.  It is very difficult for the interpreters to hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> The reason for me to say that, in most cases that affected whites at the time were fully attended easily but those that were affecting the black people, they were not even there to attend.  They were just using the black policemen to defend the apartheid regime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Mr Tanda, just tell us again.  At the moment you serve in the SANDF, in the Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> How do you - this is a general question, how do you see your life at present, currently?  How do you see your life at the moment and where do you see yourself going?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I'll try and respond to your question although it is a very difficult question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a>	I look like a child who is just born and I was in prison, involved in other things, and to me it's like a new life.  I'm not yet prepared to say whether I'm going forward or backwards but I am prepared.  I wish to go on and lead a normal life just like other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> I just want to comment on this.  There is a general criticism from certain members of the public that where amnesty is granted to people like yourself, where you've killed other people, that you are being let loose on the public and that you are likely to commit the same offences again, do you want to comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I can say the people of South Africa must know that we were involved in the struggle because I was mentally disturbed but I was there to liberate the nation that was oppressed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>	As I'm saying, the times of conflict is gone now and we are living with people.  Wherever we live, we live just like other normal people.   And secondly, they mustn't think that a revolution wasn't there, we were just pushing a revolution, because even the liberation that the people are talking about today, no matter who can say what, we've got to admit that those were the bullets of APLA, AZAPO and MK that managed to put us where we are today.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>	We must not forget that because everyone knows that there are members of APLA who are in jails today and the members of Azania and ANC and MK.  They are there because they wanted to liberate their nation and therefore they see us as people who are troublesome by trying to liberate our nation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Then just lastly, did you gain materially, did you gain anything, did you profit, did you make a profit from committing these offences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> In APLA everyone was a volunteer.  We were not benefitting anything after an operation.  We were involved in the operations because we loved our nation so much.   The only people who benefitted is the nation that was oppressed at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Just like lastly and finally, ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many times is that final?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Just this once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a>	What is your attitude towards white people in this country, who live in this country, your compatriots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> In politics here in South Africa we never hated white people because of their colour as the other people were deceiving, people saying so.  We regard white people as our brothers and sisters, but the problem is the system that they were using, the system that the government was using at the time.  We don't have any attitude towards them, any bad attitude.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>	Even now we are with them, we are working with them in the National Defence Force and there is no problem.  Even in places where we live we do visit friends who are staying with whites but we don't hate them because of their colour but it's because of their actions during the apartheid regime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR ARENDSE</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is this applicant not involved in the other matters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> I speak under correction, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>	 Have the identities of your victims, the people that you killed, has that ever been made known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> No, I haven't seen them.  I only saw them when I met with my legal representative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't understand that.  I've said the identities of the people that you killed.  You say you saw them when you met your legal representative?  Just clear that up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> I think he's referring to the information which we got out of the police docket but the names and details of the deceased doesn't appear from there, we just discussed it with Mr Tanda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you any questions to ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Mr Tanda, just to go back to the Cross Roads Police Attack where you killed those two people, one of whom was a policeman and the other one was an employee of Spoornet.  Now you mentioned two names there, that is Graham and Simon.  Did you know Graham and Simon before you called them to the house where you were staying at Site C?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> I notice that in your statement you say that you briefed them in full about the operation, what did you tell them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> I told them that I want to get an order from comrade Power to start involving people in the operations.  I chose Graham and Simon and I told them that we would be going to Cross Roads to check the target that we can disarm with the aim of getting more arms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just for the purposes of clearing up the record, you mentioned the word Power, that's the same person as Mzala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think we should one name throughout these proceedings otherwise the record, if it is read by somebody, might be confusing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>	So when you saw these two people you were not really expecting to see them walking in that area, were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> As I say the attack didn't take place far from the Cross Road Police Station.  I knew that police  are patrolling in the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> If you had not come across these two people, what would you have done that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> As I'm talking about the people who were patrolling, I knew that I would get some policemen patrolling in the area.  I knew that for sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Why were the police patrolling the area?  Were there any incidents happening in that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR TANDA:</span> If you'd notice that from 1986 up until today, the Cross Roads, time and again there are conflicts among the African people in that area and because of those conflicts the police are there to patrol the areas where the Africans are residing.  As in the white areas the police would be there, even if they are there to check on thugs or for whatever reasons but they are there.  They are always there patrolling all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Tata.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you wish to put any questions to the applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> No, Chairperson, I have no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you are excused.</p>
