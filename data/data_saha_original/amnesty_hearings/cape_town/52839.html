<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> What is that college's name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> It's Lyceum College.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> How old are you now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> I'm 22 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Now you were involved in an incident with Walter Tanda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> In 1992, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> At that time you would have been 16, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> At the time, were you a member of the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Were you a member of APLA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> No, I was only a member of the task force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> The PAC task force or APLA task force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> The PAC task force, that was the defence unit of the PAC that was being trained by the members of APLA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Who was the commander of the task force you were a member of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> It was Tanda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Did he recruit you to join this task force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Yes, I was recruited by him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Were you - tell us about, were you at school at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Yes, I was still at school, I was doing standard seven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Now, this particular incident at Khayelitsha, when did you first become involved in it and how did you become involved in it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Tanda came at my home, he asked me to go with him as a member of the PAC and as a person who was in the leadership, that was the normal thing for me to do.  We went to a certain house at Site C where we found two comrades.  He introduced them as PAC members and he told them that I was also a member of PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Did they have names and if so, what were their names?  Did he introduce them to you by name or code-name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> He introduced them as members of PAC, he never mentioned their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Did you ask their names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> No, I never asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Why not, isn't that odd?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> It is not a normal thing to do, to know the people with their names.  If you are told that these comrades are members of PAC, that should satisfy you.  I was not interested in knowing their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> After you were introduced, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Tanda left the house and he said he was coming back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> And he came back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Yes, he came back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Did he come back with anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> He came with a bag, a blue bag with firearms inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Did you get a firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Yes, I got an AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Were you going to do anything with this AK47?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> He told us after some time that we are going to do something because we checked these firearms, if they were working properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Before this, did you handle a firearm before this particular or before he gave the AK47 to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Yes, I once handled a firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> And that was during training I take it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> This particular operation, had you been on one like this before or was this your first operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> That was my first operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Did he tell you that you were now going to carry out an operation, this is now Tanda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Yes, he told us that there is a work that we are going to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Did he tell you when it was going to happen, where it was going to happen, who was going to be the object of this operation?  Did he give you any details?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> No, he never gave details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> So what did you do then, did you leave the place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Yes, he told us to leave the house and we all left together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> And where did you go to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> We went - we took a direction to Site B, we took the road coming from Site B, we went to Site C.  We took a road from Site B to Site C.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Were you on foot or did you drive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> We were on foot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> And when you got to Site C, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> He instructed me - as I was standing next to this road from Site C to Site B on the left-hand site, he instructed me to stand there and if I see the police van I was to give a warning by shooting only once with this AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> And did you do so, did you shoot once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> The van never appeared from my direction, it appeared from another direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> And what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> There were gunshots, a lot of them followed, a lot of gunshots and a van passed next to me and it stopped at a distance and Tanda gave an instruction for us to leave the place.  We went back to the veld and through the veld we went to Site C.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Did you fire any shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Do you know who fired the shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> It's Tanda and the other comrades, but I don't know among them who shot but I know that they were the people who were shooting because they also had firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Do you know whether anyone was injured or killed during the attack or as a result of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> No, I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Why did you form part of the attack, why did you become part of the operation?  What motivated you to become part of the operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> As Tanda was the leader of the task and as a member of the PAC, when he came to me and instructed me to do something I went there willingly because I knew that I had a perception that this is done to further the aims of PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Now you - and I'm referring here Chairperson, to page 39 of the bundle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>	You also applied for amnesty in respect of the attack on the St James Church in July 1993, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> You made an application there and also a full disclosure and also motivated why you were involved in that attack, you can remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Yes, I do remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> And you've been granted amnesty in respect of that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> This particular incident, were you arrested at all?  Did you appear in court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> No, I was never arrested and I never appeared in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> No further questions, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR ARENDSE</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Just one Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Mr Makoma, why do you apply for amnesty for this incident, you never shot anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> I'm applying for amnesty because I was there, even though I didn't shoot anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Do you associate yourself with the shooting that took place on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Has anyone been able to ascertain what the police docket has got to say about this, what is contained in it?  Were there any victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Advocate Sandi, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, I confirm Chairperson, there appears to be no victim in this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Did I understand you to say that you belong to APLA task force, not the PAC task force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> I said, at the time I was a member of PAC and I was also a member of the task force that was being trained by the APLA members in order to defend PAC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you draw a distinction between being a member of the task force of the PAC on the one hand and of APLA on the other?  Is there a difference between the task force of the PAC and the task force of APLA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> PAC is a political organisation and APLA is a military wing and a task force is a defence unit but all of them consists of members of the PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say that you're a member of the task force, it would be the task force of APLA or PAC, it's one and the same thing, is that it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> It is a task force of PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>	Yes, thank you very much, you are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>Unless you have questions to put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> No, I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOMA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> Chairperson, is this perhaps a convenient point to adjourn before we begin with Mr Shiceka, it's four incidents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, can we make an early beginning please.  I've lost a lot of time in this matter.  I'd like to have a shorter break for lunch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARENDSE:</span> As you please Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll break for 45 minutes, Mr Zuko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
