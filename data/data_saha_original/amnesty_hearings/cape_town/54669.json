Although I deny that I killed him unlawfully and wrongfully, he did however die as a result of an action on my part and for that I apologise.\n\tLife is precious and judged ex post facto, and based on today's political situation of reconciliation, his death was unnecessary.\n\tFurther I also apologise to the people whom I assaulted during interrogation, namely Peter Jacobs, Ashley Forbes, Anwar Dramat, Tony Yengeni, Gary Kruse, Niclo Pedro and Allan Mamba.\n\tDirector, Gary Kruse contacted me last week and we talked about reconciliation.  In the position which I am sitting here today, the persons whose names I have now mentioned, have come to me and have shaken my hand and wished me all the best and I think Mrs Forbes, I know her as Mina Pandy, I would like to thank her very much for her attitude.

            "I will do so.  According to what I heard this morning and last week, I believe there is no question of any bitterness amongst these people.  As Director Kruse mentioned, Jeff, we are all now on the same side.\n\tThey also told me that they wouldn't oppose my application and I will be eternally grateful to them for that.  It is now reconciliation, forgive and forget at its best. \n\tIt should also be mentioned that about a year ago, Jeremy Vearey who is now a Senior Superintendent in the South African Police Service, Information Unit, he approached me and asked me to join his Unit.\n\tMy answer to Senior Superintendent Vearey was I would consider it if it has nothing to do with politics.  In my application I apply for amnesty for perjury in that I hadn't spoken the truth during the court proceedings and also as a result of the assaults which I have committed on Gary Kruse, Mr Yengeni and the rest, excluded the Ashley Kriel incident.\n\tThe question which could now be asked is why my application now should be believed?  Superintendent Liebenberg and myself are the only members of the Terrorist Tracking Unit who applied.  I was the first one and I did that voluntarily.\n\tI cooperated with the Truth Commission from the outset.  On the 8th of April of this year, I met members of the Truth Commission and I approached them of my own free will and I wasn't subpoenaed to attend proceedings.\n\tI cooperated with the Investigation Unit, that is the Investigation Unit of the Truth Commission and was interrogated or questioned by them almost a whole day and I have declared myself to be willing to provide further information.  A further date, the 23rd of April, was arranged with my legal representative and that date did not materialise and that was not due to my fault.\n\tIn letters to the Truth Commission, I declared myself willing to, should I be provided with the necessary information, to further assist the Committee.  Unfortunately that never happened.\n\tThe fact that Director Kruse is not opposing my application also indicate that they forgive me and accept my version as correct.  Since Ashley Kriel's death, I stand by my version of the fact that his death was an accident, a formal judicial inquest was held and there my version was accepted.\n\tDuring the inquest Ashley Kriel's family were represented by one of the top Advocates and evidence was led on their behalf.  A Pathologist appointed by the family, could not contradict my evidence and I stand by my version and I say that it was true and correct.\n\tTo conclude, I would once again like to say to the family and all the men and women whom I harmed, I would like to apologise to them, thank you Chairperson.",

            "Mr Chairman, I refer you to the application, page 2, paragraph 9(a), there the applicant distinguishes between two periods, namely (a), his period at Murder and Robbery at Bishop Lavis from 1986 and (b), his period at the Terrorist Tracing Unit, from the middle of 1986 to 1990.\n\tIf you turn to page 3, under A, period at Murder and Robbery at Bishop Lavis.  When the application was drafted, my client made it very clear in his application and I am sure you would have gone through it, mentioned that due to a lack of recollection and the fact that he received no information from the Truth Commission, he was not able to give the Committee enough information and that he could not apply for amnesty for any incidents which include any delicts.\n\tMr Brink, who is to the right of me here, gave me a transcript last week, this is a transcript of the Sithlahya incident and you will see the nature and particulars on page 3 and following pages, once again, that incident my client cannot remember and therefore he cannot apply for that.\n\tAfter studying the transcript of the Sithlahya matter, there is only one sentence on page 2 where Mr Knipe is mentioned as having been involved in the assault on Mr Sithlahya.  My client is not implicated in any way in that transcript of Mr Sithlahya.\n\tThis information came to the fore during the questioning by the Investigating Unit of the Truth Commission and there it was mentioned to my client that he was implicated.\n\tYou will see in the application, second last page, I applied for a copy of any statement which implicates  my client, which the Investigating Unit might have in its possession.  I don't know why, but they never provided me with any particulars, until Mr Brink read the application and saw that we had problems with information and he then gave us the transcript.  \n\tI accordingly want to bring it to your attention that this whole period during which my client was at Murder and Robbery, had nothing to do with politics.  So there is no question of my client applying for amnesty for any delict committed with a political objective in this period.\n\tHe denies categorically that he assaulted Mr Sithlahya in any way, he categorically denies that in this period at Murder and Robbery, he assaulted anybody, whether with a political motive or a common criminal.\n\tSo I would like to ask you to ignore this period so pages 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, we can actually delete.",

            "Reads\n\"Due to a lack of recollection, inter alia due to a lapse of time, I can't remember exactly who, where and why I arrested and questioned people.\n\tAs far as I can remember, the following terrorists who were trained abroad were arrested and questioned by myself of the Investigating team.  Peter Jacobs, Ashley Forbes, Anwar Dramat, Tony Yengeni, Gary Kruse, Niclo Pedro and Alan Mamba.\n\tIf I may just mention here that trials of Tony Yengeni, I am not sure about Gary Kruse's trial, the case was stopped and the other people were in fact sentenced.\n\tIf I have omitted to mention certain names, it is due to a lack of recollection and in no way to avoid responsibility.\n\tI accordingly also apply for the cases which I can't remember.  If I am given sufficient information as my legal representative, Adv Cook, repeatedly requested, I would like to be able to help the Committee.\n\tThe modus operandi of the Unit including myself, was as follows:  The Unit received information from a Safety Information System, regarding a member or a liberation movement who was in the Peninsula.\n\tI received direct information from my Commanding Officer, Lieutenant, now Superintendent Liebenberg, to trace this person and to arrest him.  This had to be done expeditiously to prevent any further act or acts of terror being committed.\n\tAll those persons arrested by us, had weapons of terror in their possession, or possessed information about acts of terror or gave us information about their hangers-on or sympathisers.\n\tTherefore my instructions from my Commanding Officer was that I had to act urgently and to make use of unconventional questioning methods.  This included inter alia the wet bag method, whereby a wet bag is placed over the suspect's head to disorientate him and to make him think that he is being suffocated.\n\tVery few suspects were assaulted, using an open hand.  We did not make use of fists, because we did not want to leave any physical marks.\tIn this way we ensured that no evidence aliunde was collected against us.  \n\tAll the abovementioned members of the liberation movement provided us with the necessary information within one session, which never lasted longer than half an hour.\n\tAshley Forbes was subjected to two sessions.  The last case was to extract new information from him.  Peter Jacobs is the only one which was subjected to the wet bag method for longer. If I say \"longer\" here, I mean longer than half an hour.  After they gave us the necessary information, the suspects pointed out their hangers-on as well as weaponry.  Most of the suspects were arrested within hours after we received the information that they were in the Peninsula.\n\tAfter the weapons were pointed out to us, or the sympathisers were pointed out to us, they were detained in terms of Section 29 of Security Legislation.\n\tThe Security Branch then received the docket and took the matter further.  The following, excluding Ashley Forbes, the next occasion which I had any contact with the suspects, was in the courts.  There the suspects, then accused, raised the defence that they were assaulted and or tortured which I denied under oath.  I then told lies regarding the assaults and the tortures on the orders of the Security Branch.\n\tI questioned Ashley Forbes for plus minus six months.  Apart from those two occasions where I questioned him in an unconventional way, we built up an excellent rapport and he provided me with extremely valuable information and I then gave that through to the Security hierarchy.\n\tIn conclusion I must add that the pointing-out of weapons indicated that the suspects were terrorists, who wanted to commit acts of terror in the Peninsula.  \n\tAccording to my knowledge, only one civilian, a Black man died as a result of an act of terror by the terrorists.\n\tI believed bona fide that due to my expeditious and unorthodox conduct, we made a big difference in the combatting of terror\".",

My Commanding Officer at Murder and Robbery gave me instructions to go to the Security Branch and report there.\n\tThere I acted as an investigator of people contravening the emergency regulations and I was involved there for plus minus one year.  During this period, the need arose in the Security Branch for the tracing of terrorists who had been trained abroad and who were operating in the Peninsula.\n\tI did not take part in the decision making process due to my junior rank.  I only learnt of these things from my Commanding Officers.  I was informed by Brigadier Strydom, then Head of the Security Branch, Cape Town, that I would be permanently transferred to the Security Branch and specifically the Terrorist Tracing Unit.\n\tThe Unit was stationed at Culemborg, Cape Town.   The Commanding Officer was Lieutenant, now Superintendent Liebenberg.  \n\tThe Unit consisted as an Investigating Team of myself, Warrant Officer, now senior Superintendent Nel, Sergeant J.P. van Zyl and Sergeant Kotze.\n\tLieutenant Liebenberg explained the purpose of the Unit to us as being the expeditious tracing and arrest of terrorists, collection of information and intelligence and the confiscating of weapons and arrest of hangers on.\n\tThe modus operandi of the Unit is as was set out above in paragraph ((a)(4) on pages 8 and 9 above.\n\tOn the 8th of June 1989, I received a certificate and a medal from the South African Police for my service in the combatting and tracing of terrorists and this confirms my believe that my seniors condoned my acts.",

The acts which I committed I answer, based on the following criteria as contained in Section 23 (a) - (f) of Act 34 of 1995.\n\tThe motive why I committed these acts was to, in respect of terrorists who were trained abroad and attached to the ANC or MK, to trace these people to arrest them, to collect information, weaponry and also to arrest hangers on.\n\tThis prevented further acts of terror int he country and in the Peninsula.  The context for these acts was in reaction to political insurrection or disturbance of the ANC.  The ANC tried to overthrow the government by military means.\n\tThese terrorists trained abroad and were active in the Peninsula, were instrumental to the objectives of the ANC who tried to make the Peninsula ungovernable by means of acts of terror.\n\tThe legal and factual nature, as well as the gravity of the offences were per se unlawful and serious.  Nobody was however seriously injured or sustained lasting physical or mental harm or damage as far as I know.

            "I am number W80113K, in the South African Police, Detective Warrant Officer, stationed at Cape Town.\n\tOn Thursday, the 9th of July 1987, at 13h35 I was on duty, I was sober and clad in civilian dress.  I was accompanied by number K173415M, Sergeant A.D. Abels of the Security Branch in Cape Town.  On the instructions and orders of our Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Liebenberg, Sergeant Abels and myself went to Albermarle Road 8, Hazendal, Athlone.\n\tOur task was to do surveillance of the grounds there, to determine whether the trained ANC terrorist, Ashley Kriel, was hiding out there.  We only had information to the effect that the abovementioned terrorist could be in the house or in one of the adjacent houses and therefore Sergeant Abels and myself, approached the house on foot whilst other members of the Security Branch waited out of sight of the house.\n\tUpon arrival at the abovementioned address, I saw that there was a gate in front of the door and this gate was locked with a padlock.  Sergeant Abels and myself then walked around the back of the house to the back door.  I requested Sergeant Abels to knock on the door to determine whether anybody was home.\n\tAfter a couple of minutes, a Coloured man opened the door.  The Coloured man held a jersey and a towel in front of his trousers, his right hand was covered with this jersey and a towel and his left hand was pressed against his covered right hand.\n\tI immediately recognised this person as the wanted terrorist, Ashley Kriel.  I identified myself to Ashley Kriel as a member of the South African Police.  Kriel immediately  made an upwards motion with his covered hands.  At the same time, he tried to run into the house.\n\tI threw both my arms around Ashley Kriel's arms and chest, trying to pin his arms to his body.  He resisted furiously and battled to free himself.  I suspected that he had either a firearm or a handgrenade in his arms under the jersey and the towel.\n\tSergeant Abels assisted me and we managed to restrain Ashley Kriel, who resisted.  During this struggle the towel and the jersey fell and I saw Kriel holding a firearm with both his hands in front of him, and he tried to raise it.\n\tWe had already fallen to the ground during the struggle, and we tried to pin down to the ground.  I succeeded in getting the firearm from, loosening it from his grip, it was an automatic pistol and I hit him on the forehead, quite a heavy blow and this wound bled freely.\n\tKriel released his grip for a moment whilst he was laying on his back, and we pinned him down to the ground.  I was in a crouching position on his right hand side and Sergeant Abels to the left of him, at his head.  \tI still held this firearm which I took from Kriel in my right hand and with my left hand, I took my handcuffs from my pocket and I handed them to Sergeant Abels, with the instruction that he should handcuff Kriel's hands.\n\tJust after Sergeant Abels had placed the one cuff around Kriel's right wrist, Kriel jumped up into a sitting position and grabbed my right hand in which this firearm still was.\n\tI grabbed my right hand with the firearm out of his grip.  He turned to his left, whilst he was still in a sitting position in order to free himself and get up.  Sergeant Abels, meanwhile tried to restrain Kriel.  I however, realised that Kriel was getting into an upright position and from my position at that stage, which was behind him, because he was turned away from me, I jumped on his back in order to pin him down to the ground once again.\n\tWith me on his back, he thrashed in all directions and tried to enter the house.  At some stages we were on the ground and other stages we were kneeling or - it as during this stage that I heard a shot.  I realised that it was his firearm which was still in my right hand which had gone off.\n\tI realised that Kriel had been wounded and I noticed blood at his mouth and nose.  I immediately instructed Sergeant Abels to cuff the deceased's left hand as well, and to guard him whilst I immediately went to my vehicle to get help on the radio.\n\tThe struggle couldn't have lasted for more than a minute.  At no stage did I cock the weapon and in the struggle, I didn't notice whether it had been cocked.  \n\tHowever, I am of the opinion that the deceased must have cocked the weapon before opening the back door of the house and had concealed the weapon underneath the towel and the jersey.\n\tWhen I returned to where Ashley Kriel was, it was clear that he was dead.  During the search of the deceased's room in Albermarle Road 8, a handgrenade was found under his pillow.   This was found by Warrant Officer Nel of the Security Branch and the explosives expert seized this handgrenade.\n\tI seized the deceased's firearm, a .22 star, self loading pistol, number F739725 with seven rounds in the magazine and one round in the chamber of the pistol.\n\tNext to the body, there was one .22 pellet which I seized.  After the incident, I secured the weapon myself.  I pointed out the relevant points of the official police photographer as well as members of the video unit.\n\tThe handcuff on the left hand wrist had been loosened to indicate the position of the handcuffs during the struggle and the body was then taken from the scene by ambulance.\n\tDuring the incident, my glasses, the left lens of my glasses had been damaged and I sustained light chafing wounds to my elbows and arms and bruised my right knee.  I did not receive any medical treatment for my injuries and there then follows the details regarding the oath.",

            "Mr Yengeni, today in a new South Africa I can sit here and tell you in all honesty, that I was used by the then Security Branch.\n\tMembers of my Unit received recognition for their services rendered.  When it came down to getting the job done, I was the person who did it.  Maybe I was to patriotic, to naive or anything else that you would want to call it.\n\tBut I think even you and the rest of your people sitting there, would admit that I was the person that rightly or wrongly knowing that the information that I could glean from you and your members, could take especially explosives out of the community, which would be used against the public at large.  Mr Yengeni, with my absolutely unorthodox methods and by removing your weaponry from you, I am wholly convinced that I prevented you and any of your colleagues and any one of them that ever had an explosive device in Cape Town, I may have prevented you from being branded murderer nowadays.\n\tThe only person I can unfortunately not say to, is one of the comrades here whose methods led to the death of an innocent Black person who was foraging in a dirt drum for food.  For what I did to you and your comrades, I apologise.  I sincerely apologise.\n\tBut in the spirit of reconciliation, we lived in a different era, we were enemies then.  I have not fled the country, run away from the Police Force, I am still a policeman and trying to serve my community to the best of my ability.  And that is the reason why I out of my own free will have approached this Commission to see if we can't build, and forget about the hardships.\n\tI know you've got hardships, the people in this hallway believe and now that I am older, I believe that you had - it was illegal, it was not sought for, each person had to have his place in the sun in South Africa and I sincerely hope that, but if I may just indulge the Commission for a further few minutes- I am married and have two children.\n\tSince my son was in Sub B, he was a little boy of six years old, my daughter was in standard 5, I think she was about 12, for weeks my children could not play in the normal ambit of other children.  Because of my work with the Security Branch, they had to travel under police escort to school, they could not play on the playground with the other children.  They had to be put in the principal's office all the time, under guard.  \n\tMy house windows had to be barricaded with cupboards.  Every night a wet blanket had to be put in the bath, available where my younger children could get hold of that in the case of grenade attacks.  You are surely aware that I was transferred as the Station Commander at Stanford because not only were my nerves shot, my wife threatened divorce if I did not get out of Cape Town.\n\tThat was after the African Youth League threatened to have demonstrations on my front lawn.  Yes, Mr Yengeni, I did terrible things, I did terrible things to members of the ANC, but as God as my witness, believe me, I have also suffered.\n\tI may not call myself a victim of Apartheid, but yes Sir, I have also been a victim.",

I have subsequently been, and I am now still, under treatment, where I have to take tablets on a regular basis.\n\tI have respect for every cadre of Umkhonto weSizwe as  I know the situation now.  The times when we were adversaries, was a different time.  I had the fortune or misfortune of growing up in a White environment in Cape Town.\n\tI did not either through my own stupidity or ignorance as long as I was one of the Whites, the privileged Whites who had an education, who had a house, I couldn't see it being taken away.  If you ask me what type of person is it that can do that, I ask myself the same question.\n\tBearing in mind for want of a better explanation, if you had a bad foot and the surgeon had to cut it off to save your life, then maybe I am trying to soften my conscience by saying that is the person who I was, irrespective how dirty, how mean, how horrible it was, I would do that and it was not and I think, you and the rest of the accused, could say that for the initial interrogation that I did, the day after or the day after that or the day after that, I did not interrogate any one of you with a bad method.\n\tAnd I think all of you can say that in honesty.

If it was unorthodox, we have to think of it in the context of the time we were living in then.  My greatest fear at that stage and I hope the people here could see the predicament that I was in, if a SPM limpet mine had to be detonated in the Golden Acre at that stage of which we had information, that would have been catastrophic.\n\tCape Town, thank God, did not have the terrorist or freedom fighter actions of a Bloed Street, Church Street, Magoo's Bar and one of those places.

All I can say is and that is on trust, that yes, I did commit perjury, I did lie to the courts as far as assaults and things like that went.  The rest of my evidence in the courts of law as to the recovery of weaponry were fact and I think even Mr Yengeni can admit that, that it was for the recovery of certain materials of war.\n\tI have asked this Commission to believe me.  I have tried to be sincere.  I was never subpoenaed to speak to the Investigation Unit of the TRC, I voluntarily went there and I voluntarily helped them as far as I could with questions put to me.\n\tI am hoping that the Commission and with respect to the Commission, even more so the persons who I have done this injustice to, that they should believe in what I have to say here today.\n\tBecause without trust it is going to be very difficult for truth and reconciliation to take place.

Several questions were asked by the victims and documents were handed in as Exhibits and my client was expected to answer certain things which he was not able to do by virtue of his junior rank at the time and by virtue of the fact that he didn't have access to this privileged information and policy forming.\n\tI consulted a Senior Officer last night, a Senior Officer in the South African Police, he is a General and he is prepared to come forward and to admit that there was a chain of command which came from the top.  And that unconventional methods were indeed used, or could be used and that they were authorised to do so.  It is important that my client be given that opportunity to place that information and evidence before the Commission.  At this stage he is being left out on a limb and it is only fair that the Senior Officers must now realise the consequences of their actions and that they come forward to face those.\n\tThe second part of my application deals with the fact that I wanted to submit a psychiatric report.  The Psychologist told me that she could not at this stage, provide the Commission with the necessary information apart from a short summary and she would like to have follow up consultations with Mr Benzien to be able to provide the necessary background information and a properly formulated finding.\n\tI think that it is in the interests of truth that this information be placed before you and I therefore request you to adjourn these proceedings to give my client that opportunity.
