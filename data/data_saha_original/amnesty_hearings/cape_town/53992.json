There were ANC members within that.  Botswana, Gaberone ...(indistinct) the raid, were probably the most culturally active and exciting place to be in South Africa.  We had Hugh Masekela playing one night at a club, we Jonas Gwango one night in a club.  We had brilliant artists like Thami Mnyele whose art we had access to.  We had Wally Serotse, one of Africa's most famous writers wandering amongst us, Willy Gosetsili, another famous writer.  We had access to culture that we had never, nobody had ever had access to that sort of culture before and we were all involved and all producing and all writing, it was the most creative time of everybody's lives.  People like Mike Hamlyn and Uriel who, although as Ms Baleka says, they were ANC members, they were actually on the periphery of the ANC community and working within MEDU.  What happened as a result of that raid is that community was shattered, entirely shattered, creativity was shattered for ages and ages.  Many of the women who were there, we had babies afterwards, we produced, we went on in other countries and carried on with our lives and made babies because we didn't want to just die, but creativity did die for a long time and the raid forced people to become more militant, so you had a situation where people who had been involved in creative activities, artistic activities, decided the regime is so irrational that it can attack artists, poets, writers, it is so irrational, let us take up arms, so although I had taken up arms previously, others had not and they did subsequently.",

It's not everybody who left South Africa as a political activist and being absorbed immediately into ANC structures, in the way in which we've heard Ms Anderson talking about being absorbed into ANC structures.  Lots of people just left the country, either legally by means of crossing the border by means of a passport, or illegally by means of skipping the border.  When you get to Botswana, or let me say when we got to Botswana, you were required to apply for refugee status.  That involved going to the police station and declaring yourself a refugee.  The standard procedure of the Botswana police was to ask you, do you want to join the ANC, do you want to join the PAC, do you want to join the - AZAPO didn't have any organisation in Botswana, it was called the Black Consciousness Movement.  The Botswana Police would ask you do you want to join the BCM or did you not want to join any organisation.   The ANC was the only organisation which had a clear organised presence in Botswana in the sense of having had what was then called a Chief Representative.  In the even where you said that you wanted to join the ANC, the Botswana police would call the ANC chief representative, who at the time was Mr Isaac Makoko and Mr Makoko would come to you and would require two things.  The first is he would require you to write what was called a biography.  In other words you had to write a statement about your life up to the point where you arrived in Botswana.  The second is that Mr Makoko would require from you a decision as to whether you wanted to study or whether you wanted to join MK and that was standard procedure for the majority of people who left the country and became ANC members.  In the even where you wanted to study, there would be further options available.  It was possible to remain in Botswana and study there or it was possible for the ANC to take you from Botswana to Tanzania to Somafko, to Solomon Mahlango Freedom College where you would await the opportunity for a scholarship.  I think the distinguishing factor between remaining in Botswana and going to Somafko was your choice of study.  The University of Botswana for instance could not offer a course in architecture and therefore one of the chaps who lived with us, Alan Samuel, wanted to become an architect, had to leave Botswana, go to Somafko from where he went to German, he is now a successful architect practising in Germany.  That was the procedure.  Further to that, if you had indicated that you wanted to undergo military training or you wanted to undertake a course of study which was not offered in Botswana, you would be taken to live in Dukwe refugee camp, which is not too far from Francistown in the Northern part, well it's really central Botswana, but in terms of the road which crosses through Botswana, its in the North.  You would be required to live at Dukwe Refugee Camp until such time as the facilities were there for you to leave and then undertake your course of study, so if we were to take the definition offered by Ms Anderson, in other words of a person being an ANC member who is active within a unit of the ANC who is receiving direct political instructions, then Mike was not a member of the ANC.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, would give the ANC 50 steel cots with mattresses for these people to sleep on.  They would give the ANC the supply of sardines, of cooking oil, of mielie pap and so on, which would be delivered to the ANC in bulk, which the ANC would have to transport to its members in Dukwe Refugee Camp, or to its members in other parts of Botswana because refugees did not all simply live in Dukwe Refugee Camp.  So I wanted to say this on the question of the delivery of supplies, that in my opinion and later on after I had completed my military training, I became Regional Treasurer of the ANC in Angola where I was directly responsible for what we termed logistics, which was the supply of all basic foodstuff, deodorant, buckets, everything, face cloths, underwear, to all ANC members living in Botswana and that is a full-time occupation.  The receiving of the supplies, the delivery of the supplies, making sure that you don't run out of supplies etc., it is a full-time occupation and I do feel that it is necessary to clarify that and it would be, even in Angola, which was the safest place of the ANC, even in Angola, logistics was totally separate from Ordinance.  We dealt with food supplies, with clothing, with furniture, with building material, etc.  Weapons was dealt with by a completely separate branch, they stood totally alone, so that even in a situation where we were completely safe, there was no way in which supplies included your weapons and ordinances.",

I therefore spoke to the ANC Chief Rep and together we went to see the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  They arranged for me to fly from Botswana via Zimbabwe to Zambia.  We over-nighted in Zimbabwe for one night and it was my decision immediately after the raid that I wanted to join MK, I wanted to be able to fight back on equal terms, with these chaps.  In fact, during my military training when we had to go for shooting lessons, I would often be unable to see the target, I would only see a brown uniform, as a consequence of which I shot very, very well, to the extent that as a trainee I was given the responsibility of carrying the company machine gun in my platoon and immediately after my basic training, I was trained in anti-aircraft artillery because of the way, up to day, I visit the shooting range regularly and my average in shooting, even with a pistol, is in excess of 95% accuracy, so I want to say that I started my military training after the raid into Botswana.

In the first instance in March 1985 they blew up by car bomb Mr Roger Nkadimeng, that was March 1980 and it was a complete over-kill, a complete over-kill.  I mean that was in Gaberone yes, in a block of flats.  I mean with Roger it was a complete over-kill.  When I did my military training I learned that one normally calculates the amount of explosives that you use scientifically but that say 250 grams of medium type explosive like TNT or what the Americans call C4 and things like that, medium-type explosives, you require approximately 250 grams of explosives to destroy a railway track.  In the case of Roger Nkadimeng, they blew up the car completely, the engine was lifted from the ground floor where it was parked and went through the roof of the flat which was two stories above.  It was a complete - there was nothing left of Roger, except his feet.  His feet just below the ankle which were still attached to the shoes.  That was all that was left of Roger.  That was March 1985.  Then I think it was May 1985 when the Botswana police raided the premises in Mogoditsane and found a caravan full of ANC weapons.  It was in the newspapers at the time, so it was clear that there was an escalation of South African activities against ANC people in Botswana.  It was mentioned earlier that we had been alerted.  It's true, it wasn't the first time that we had been alerted.  Yes, we had been alerted.  We, in response to the alert, because in the area where we stayed, there were Barry Guilder, Peter Richie, ourselves, Eric ...(indistinct), Judy Sideman, there were five houses which were inhabited by people who were either ANC members or supporters of the ANC and at one stage we had instituted a system where we would take turns to walk from the - at night, to walk from the one house to the next and just make sure that there's nothing untoward happening and the ANC always interpreted the question of the state of alert very seriously and it depended on the area where you were, on what type of action was undertaken.  In Angola for instance in the training camps where these facilities existed, we would move to alternative bases, when there was an alert.  In Zambia when there was an alert, the Security Department would visit each and every single ANC house and make sure that people were able to at least defend themselves.  In Tanzania where we had large concentrations of ANC people living unarmed at Morogworo, Somafko, the Tanzanian army would be alerted and they would step up their activities.  In the forward areas like in Botswana, there was essentially nothing that we could do.  I mean even the system that we had of taking turns to walk towards one another's houses, would have meant absolutely nothing, I mean, considering what Mr Olifant said yesterday about 50,60 tanks and jet fighters and helicopters and things, it's quite pathetic.  What we were able to do was nothing, so that was what follows from this issue Mr Chair.",

Alright?  That's the one way.

So I am saying to you that it is incredibly difficult for us to reconcile at, not only at a personal level when this kind of stuff is still going on, it is immeasurably more difficult to reconcile at a national level and get our country working.  It's - I mean I was saying to Michelle on Sunday, my wife, that one of the things that really frustrates me about South Africa is the fact that these days there is no proper debate of issues.  There's no proper engagement of issues.  If you criticise Mr Malan, the very first criticism is that Mr Malan is a racist because Mr Malan is white and therefore he must be a racist.  If I say that I think the ANC really messed up on the question of HIV Aids, they didn't handle it properly in my personal opinion, then I'm anti-democratic.  I mean, I just feel that we must stop this whole - we must engage, we must debate properly and then we'll be able to reconcile.  We must be able to debate these issues and we must come forward cleanly when we talk to each other.  We mustn't come into the debate with hidden agendas, like the way Mr Olifant was coming in here yesterday.

There are many reasons why a contradiction can emerge, one of them being reconstructive reasoning.  That reconstructive reasoning may result from a faulty memory but a desire to disclose facts.  It may result from opinion, it may result from hearsay.  Laymen, as we know, are inclined to indulge in reconstructive reasoning.

In so far as full disclosure is concerned, there are two issues to my mind.  Whether in relation to the information aspects that he's been questioned on, the Commission comes to the view that he has deliberately and intentionally hidden facts from this Commission on aspects that he has been questioned about and aspects which the Commission would like to know about.  That's the one.  The second aspect is whether or not the Commission was of the view that with regard to the information that he has conveyed to the Commission, he has deliberately lied.  If those two aspects are absent, well then in relation tot he information that he's disclosed and any further aspects the Commission wants to know about from him in the performance of the Commission's function, those two aspects are absent, then he has made full disclosure, from a practical point of view.  The only issues that remain are, are there indications that clearly show that in relation to the information he has provided, he has, in a material respect, lied to this Commission, or in relation to aspects of information incidents or whatever the Commission is interested in and want to know about, he has deliberately withheld information from the Commission.  Now I would, with respect, submit that in the analysis of his testimony, looking at it holistically, taking it as a whole, there is no proof that he has done either of those things.  What he has been exposed, is doing in one or two instances at worst is that he has indulged in reconstructive reasoning when providing the affidavits concerned, but in the controlled process of oral testimony and cross-examination, reconstructive reasoning on one or two aspects has been exposed, but I would, with respect, submit that in conveying what he knows about the situation to this Commission, these aspects are not particularly material.  Whether he was told for example by Pretorius, at the time when Pretorius spoke to him that there was going to be this raid on Botswana or whether he found out about it at Hammanskraal, is neither here nor there.  What difference does it make?  He found out about the raid.  It may be that he reconstructed in his mind that Pretorius told them this, whereas being tested in oral testimony on his memory, he realised, no, sorry, this came from Hammanskraal.\n\tIs that material?

It is hugely frustrating, I know, it's massively frustrating for everybody, but can the Commission be convinced on the totality of his testimony that he is for example hiding the name of that General from the Commission?  Is he doing that?  I would submit there is no justification to say he is not, when he can't remember other aspects.  Is there a single aspect that he was questioned on and when he said:  \"Look I'm sorry, but now I'm afraid I cannot remember, I cannot supply you that information\", are there any aspects, I pose a rhetorical question again, where the Commission can be satisfied that no, he's lied to us about no remembering, he's actually deliberately withholding this evidence from us.  I would submit there's not one single example upon which the Commission can be satisfied that that is the case.

We know that, it's part of our history and there's no doubt that the Security Forces wanted to neutralise that threat.

What I'm submitting is that the applicants tailored their evidence to fall neatly within what would be accepted as being an act associated with a political objective because if it was an attack aimed at the army of the ANC, an attack by the army of apartheid, then questions of proportionality and motive and all of those things are easy to decide, but when you have an attack and I submit that this attack is clear, was an attack - look at the facts, 1985, I submit you can take judicial notice of the fact that that was when the state of emergency, the first state of emergency was declared, 1985, the climate at that time, the rumblings from the apartheid state that were coming out at that time, the way there was such a clamp down, then Mr McPherson testified.",

As Krause and Smit told you that they were field workers, or they collected information, Smit was the field worker who passed on the information to Krause, neither of them could remember much.  I think Krause remembered Mr Mnyele, if I'm not mistaken, but one of them, but he couldn't remember any information about any of the others and then in cross-examination, in evidence-in-chief he was asked whether he associated himself with the raid and he said yes.  In cross-examination he was asked:  \"Did you know before you gave the information that it was going to be used in the raid?\" and he said no and Smit also said no.  Chairperson, we say that with respect that makes no difference to the fact that they knew at the time of the raid, that the information that they had provided was going to be used.",
