He told me not to say anything concerning politics, because these people would torture me and they would kill me.  I then met this police in prison again.  He said that, he confirmed this.  He said that if I mentioned anything about politics these police would have killed me.  It was very difficult for me to talk about politics in the trial.  Secondly, at the time of the trial there was no hope as I have, I was, I had no hope as I have hope to this Commission.  Thirdly, if you would be arrested concerning a political activity you would not get a parole in prison.  It was very difficult to get a pay, a bail.  There were no indemnity for political reasons in those years.  If you would be involved in politics at the time, if you were arrested you would be arrested for a long time and they would torture you.  Those are some of the reasons why I did not mention directly my involvement in politics.",

That is why I made amnesty to the Commission and I asked for forgiveness to the members of the family and Mr Siebrits's son and Mrs N Foster's son responded and he said that he accepted this.  He forgave me and the community in Mbekweni also forgave me.  Those were people we wanted them also to be liberated in this country, but it happened that they were shot and killed.
