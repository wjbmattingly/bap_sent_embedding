Whether or not you might be subject to extradition, let's leave that aside.  Certainly if you travel and you go to Zimbabwe, you could be arrested and prosecuted and the fact that you've got amnesty here would be neither here nor there, but that doesn't assist someone like Mr Basson in putting forward the kind of argument that he's putting forward here, in the sense that our argument's going to be that he has an obligation to tell the whole truth about his activities, he can't decide because of certain negative consequences for him if he tells the whole truth, that he's not going to do so.",

The fact of the matter is he got that advice, on that advice he did not request amnesty for external deeds in foreign countries.  Even if he wants to change his mind at this stage, he cannot apply for amnesty anymore.  So in any event, this Commission will not be able to grant him amnesty because it is simply for the reason he didn't apply for amnesty and therefore he would expose himself, not only to extradition to foreign countries but also prosecution within this country.
