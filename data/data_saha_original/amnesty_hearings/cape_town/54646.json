I grew up on a farm in the Mossel Bay district and matriculated at the Punt High School as Mossel Bay.  My father was a farmer and my mother was a teacher.  I grew up in a strict Afrikaner home and our whole family was members of the Dutch Reformed Church.\n\tI joined the South African Police after completion of my schooling and I and my parents supported the Government of the day. During this time, I was of the opinion that apartheid was justifiable and necessary for the safe existence of the Whites at the Southern part of South Africa and a democratic Government.\n\tI was convinced that as part of the white population group and that the only reason for survival and to guarantee their further existence, is to support the Government of the day.  That would only be possible if every population group could exist separately while the white population group would fulfil the dominant rule.\n\tDuring my career in the South African Police I acted at all times in a bona fide manner as a member of the South African Police and as a supporter of the Government of the National Party.  I saw my duty to protect the constitutional dispensation of the day and to prevent that the power basis of the National Party should be overthrown.\n\tThese personal convictions of mine were supported by my membership of the Dutch Reformed Church and they unequivocally supported the National Party's policy.  I am aware in which way the National Party Government conditioned us as members of the South African Police, to keep us loyal and true to the Government of the day.  \n\tDuring training courses at the South African Police and liaison with other members of the security police and political leaders of the National Party, we were repeatedly told that the revolutionary philosophy with the purpose of overthrowing the present regime posed a great threat for us and that the black liberation movement through these, the liberation movement wished to enforce on us their own regime.\n\tThis revolutionary onslaught I saw - regarded, in the same light as communist aggression.  I was frightened that the communist philosophy would regard South Africa as a very important target and the struggle was on a psychological level at that stage.\n\tI regarded myself as a member of the South African Police service and the security police.  As one of those people would be responsible - through security activities, to enforce law-enforcement, to create peace and stability even if that entailed the irradication of the family and enemy and their structures that would exist while there were revolutionary forces.  These revolutionary forces were a threat and we were forced to do everything in our power to prevent that.",
