            "I draw the Comittee's attention to the last paragraph on page eight of the extract which I would read into the record.\n\"By 1984 there was upsurge of resistance in most urban townships.  The State met this resistance with increased repression.  In 1985 a State of Emergency was declared.  The Congress of South African Students was banned and activists detained.  From 1985 to 89 the State attempted to crush resistance through States of Emergencies, bannings, banning organisations, censoring the media and detaining and killing activists.  It was the youth who were most active during this period and who were primarily targeted by the State.  Both the State and civil society became increasingly militarised.  Violence was seen to be an effective means of achieving change on the part of State opponents or crushing resistance of any form on the part of the State\".\nIf I then could draw the Committee's attention to the second paragraph on page nine, the last sentence which begins,\n\"The aim of the campaign of ungovernability was to render organs of Government inoperable through mass action and/or violent opposition\",\nand in the next paragraph, the last sentence beginning,\n\"Oliver Tambo, then President of the ANC, stated in a well distributed speech within South Africa that Pretoria has carried out its murderous plans to extreme.  We must now respond to the reactionary violence of the enemy with our own revolutionary violence.  The weapons are there in white houses.  Each white house has a gun or two hidden inside to use against us.  Our mothers work in their kitchens, we work in their gardens.  We must deliberately go out to look for these weapons in these houses.  It is a matter of life and death to find these weapons to use against the enemy.  The lone policeman must be made a target, he must be destroyed so that we can get his weapon.  We must learn to lay ambushes for the armed personnel carriers and the police cars that patrol the locations\",\nand then finally,\n\"Township youth, in particular, heeded the call of Tambo and spearheaded the intensification of the revolutionary strategies employed by the mass democratic movement\".\nMr Chairman, I quote rather extensively from this article by way of introduction to my argument, by way of background to the situation that the three applicants before this Committee found themselves in in 1985 which is the relevant period in which the incidents which form the subject of this amnesty occurred.  The message here, I would submit, is one of violence.  The applicants themselves and, according to their evidence, came out of a extremely violent situation.  Violence was perpetrated against them in Mbekweni and the message was clear, they were to retaliate with violence.  \n\tTo accomplish such retaliation firearms, ammunition were a very necessary part.  I would ask the Committee to consider, as well, before I commence with the actual evidence, that the three applicants were part of a group of six to seven, of six or seven people and that the remainder of that group is not before this Committee and we have the applicants' subjective views, the individuals views of what occurred on 15 April 1986 at Vlakkeland.  I submit that the applicants gave a full disclosure of what occurred on the 15th of April and that their evidence and their submissions collaborate, in material respects, each other.  In this regard the applicants gave evidence of the prevailing conditions in Mbekweni and I would submit that that is, in fact, common cause and common knowledge at this stage.\n\tThe applicants gave evidence which accords one with the other of the way in which they came together on the 15th of April 1986.  Meeting first at Block D, that applicant number one, Maxam, arrived to find out if any people had been arrested or detained or hurt in the violence that had occurred, that they later met at Block G, that applicant number three, Tisana, was the one who had the information from Nelson Sono about the arms that may be found at Vlakkeland.  Their evidence of their arrival at Vlakkeland, meeting with the farmer, Mr Noble, applicant number one asking for employment.  These important aspects of the events preceding the actual robbery and shooting accord with each other.  \n\tNow, as to the events at the actual farmhouse where the shootings occurred, it is clear and it is common cause that it was applicant number one, Maxam, who was the only one who had a firearm, he was the leader of the group and it was he who actually did the shooting.  If I might just, I will deal with, I shall shortly deal with applicant number one's evidence regarding the shooting and his reasons or motives therefore, but if I might say that applicant number two, on his evidence, was not, in fact, present when the, both shootings occurred and the particular point in his favour, in that regard I would submit, is that after they arrived and the gardener said to number two, Ndinisa, please do not shoot me, he went to number one and said do not shoot him. It then transpired number one did shoot him afterwards.  \n\tI do not want to make a heavy issue out of this, but I presume that number two, applicants two and three were convicted in the trial in this matter on the doctrine of common purpose as were the others who were convicted for the robbery on common purpose and I would ask this Committee to have regard here to the individual roles and the individual explanations of each of the applicants.",

Firstly, Comrades were the people who strove to uphold all that is good against all that is evil.  Consequently being a Comrade required being discriminating in ones behaviour at all times thus setting an example to other members of the community.

I will restrict it to motive at this stage and not go any further.  The second thing to be looked at, what was the context.  Now there was a wider and a narrower context, in my submission.  The wider context is the context of the political situation in the country and in that township round about that time, but the narrower context is the context of what happened on that day and in that respect the first applicant had a problem in that he was not reacting against somebody who was attacking him.

Now, the murders definitely must be the gravest kind of offence which you can commit and I am speaking only in respect the first applicant at the moment.  So obviously it is a very serious matter.  Then if one goes to the object or objective of the act, that is what has being discussed at some length now and then specifically whether the act or mission or offence was primarily directed at a political opponent or the State property or personnel or against private property or individuals.  Now, in this case, that is very telling, because the murder was not of a political opponent, by the first applicant's own evidence, it was somebody who was with them in the struggle.  This person could not, was a defenceless person and so when one looks at that specific criteria then he did not make the grade on that one, definitely not.\n\tThe next one, whether the act, mission or offence was committed in the execution of an order of or on behalf of or with the approval of the organisation.  Now there again there is a problem for the first applicant in that it seems to be common cause that the instruction from the ANC was not to kill.  It was to obtain firearms.  So, in respect of that criteria as well, my submission is he does not make the grade.  \n\tThen, very important, is the next one is sub-section F.  That is the relationship between the act, mission or offence and the political objective pursued and, in particular, the directness and proximity of the relationship and the proportionality of the act, mission or offence.  My submission is that the first applicant could, as has been said, when he made his decision when he decided to shoot the first shot.  Before he pulled the trigger they could have turned their backs, they could have walked away and if the farmer himself had seen them at the gate and let them enter I assume nothing further would have come it, but by pulling the trigger he did something which was completely disproportional to the circumstances and if one then looks at what happened afterwards, after the first shot in proportion to what they were there for, it is disproportionate.  \n\tThen I, in respect of the first applicant, I must go further and at the small roman two, one must just look at the facts and it makes one wonder if it was not, as it says here, if his actions do not speak of someone acting out of personal malice, ill-will or spite directed against the victims.  His evidence was, no, it was not, it was to prevent being identified, but the actions, shooting defenceless people, shooting somebody who is tied up, shooting a person who has had somebody plead for his life with you.

If I could look at the criteria again, run through them a second time in respect of the second and third applicants and then, perhaps, just before I start with Section 20, 23, right in the beginning at Section 21C there is also, of course, the text that the applicant must make a full disclosure of all the relevant facts and I mention this one first, because there is doubt in my mind whether the second and third applicants made a full disclosure and that is specifically on the point of the other items which were not disclosed.  I know there is no conclusive argument in this regard, because there were other people involved.  It just seems very strange that in spite of the meeting which the second applicant spoke of where everybody spoke, where everybody said what had happened, discussed the matter that nothing was said and this was a group, besides the first applicant, who had worked together, who trusted each other, who had been on operations before, according to the evidence.",

            "That is correct, but then in their evidence the motive is expanded into say that it was not only firearms, but anything else which could, cash or other valuables which could be sold.  Now, it seems to me just that that is possibly a convenient explanation for what happened.  One would have expected that the first and the second applicants whose motives appear on their amnesty applications clearly, would have also said that we were, our motive was to go and ransack the farmhouse, take what we could get, because we so urgently needed firearms that we were all out to take whatever we could get and it seems to me that the explanations given here were so as to explain away, to make it acceptable that there was actually a robbery.\n\tThen if one looks, secondly, at the context in respect of the second and the third applicants as regards the murders.  It is so that they were part of the group, but that the second applicant had specifically asked that the gardener not be shot.  As a group they, unfortunately, have to bear some of the brunt of what happened in the group. \n\tThe third criteria, the legal and factual nature, I will not go into that.  Then again the object or objective against which was directed, that the same arguments apply as in respect of the first applicant excepting that it could be argued in their favour, I suppose, that the stuff was stolen from a farmer, but the lives were taken of people who were their own compatriots.  \n\tThen sub-section E and that is, again, what, if they were acting within the execution of an order or with the approval of the organisation.  My submission is in this case I am not convinced that their organisation would have approved of them taking anything more than firearms.  They said that this was their motive and the text which has been supplied speaks specifically of firearms.  I think that it has just been convenient for them to say to this Committee, well, we took anything else as well to buy firearms with.  On that same point there was the evidence of the first applicant who bought a firearm for R50,00.  So there were ways and means of, other ways and means of getting firearms without killing people and that also applies then to sub-section F which is the relationship between what happened and the objective which they were pursuing and especially the proportionality of that act.  Whether it was necessary to go to these lengths to kill people, in their case not directly, but to then ransack a house go beyond the scope of their direct order.  I do not think, I think it is disproportional.  \n\tThen lastly there is the question of personal gain.  If the Committee should find that it was outside the scope of what was said in the Tambo text, that they should steal firearms, they actually took jewellery and cash as well.  The jewellery they say they bought firearms with, but the cash they used for expenses.  Now, is that not personal gain?",

He killed in an irrational manner and, on his own evidence, to avoid being identified which has all the hallmarks of a common law housebreaking and robbery.  I do not dispute that he was a political activist.  I do not dispute that the main motive was to go to the farm to get firearms, but he does not qualify for amnesty, in my submission, in respect of the murders.  If the Committee accepts his evidence, (A), that he and others went to the farmhouse in order to obtain firearms and that he, the first applicant, merely stole the bullets in the little red box which he spoke about, then it may well be that he qualifies for amnesty on the housebreaking matter.  \n\tAs far as the second and third applicants are concerned, my difficulty is that, which I share with Judge Wilson, with respect, and raised by him during my colleague, Mr Lourens's argument, and that is these two applicants had denied, notwithstanding the factual findings to the contrary by the trial court, have denied that they were in any way party to the murders of the two deceased.
