My parents and if I remember correctly, my mother, she became 70 years old and till late in her life she worked officially for the National Party.  Furthermore this apartheid policy we grew up with that in press and to the things I've heard over the radio, apart from the English press there was little criticism on the apartheid policy.  The judge prayed for the security forces, political statements praised the security forces for what thy had done and what they are doing to combat this evil.  I was also influenced by prominent people I had contact with on a daily basis.  Those were for example earlier my teachers at school and if I think back and look around me, today I remember that I think that the policy of the previous government could possibly be justifiable and was correct.

We as the security forces and especially the security branch was put - came in-between the political organisations, the National Party was the enemy of the greatest part of the population of this country, on the one side, and we were squeezed into the middle.  What they have tried to achieve to overthrow the government, to put another government in place, we tried, with all our might, to prevent that because we thought that that was the correct thing to do.\n\tOn the other hand the ANC terrorists did exactly the same thing.  They came here and they wanted to overthrow this government, the previous government.  During this process we were squeezed or forced into the middle.  We couldn't get out of this position.  We couldn't get out of this.  We were caught in-between.  It happens everywhere, in Rhodesia, in Ovamboland, everywhere where we acted we killed one-another.  This was not a one-sided process.  There were two groups of people driven by political motives and they were killing one-another.\n\tFrom our part the purpose was the create space for the previous government to find a solution to the problem.  We could not find a solution.  The solution had to be a political solution.  It had to be a political solution.  But as it's been shown now you can't solve anything by means of weapons.  If the politicians couldn't find one-another and find a solution it could not have been solved.  That was our position.\n\tIf today, if the situation rises I would cooperate with a legal government and become part of a struggle again.  I feel very sorry for the people and their families and all the relatives who suffered because of this.  But if you become involved in such a struggle people get hurt, people from both sides get hurt.\n\tYou can say I had the power; you can say I make the decision, but at that stage I believed that what I was doing was the right thing.  It was not the legal thing to do, and this is why today, before this Commission, I am applying for amnesty for what had happened.  \n\tMostly we would have never landed in this situation if it was not for this political dilemma which was not solved and into which we were forced into a certain position.  We can't say that the present government won't fall into such a dilemma.  It might happen, because there is such a lot of drama and misery entailed in such a dilemma.",
