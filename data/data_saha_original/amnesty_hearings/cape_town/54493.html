<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Morning everybody.  We'll continue with the CCB hearing.  Has it been decided who the next applicant's going to be Mr du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, he's ready to give evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">LEON A MAREE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Maree you are an applicant in this matter for amnesty in terms of the National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 95 in regard to an incident regarding Gavin Evans, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And your application was filed on the 2nd of December 1996.  It's dated the 2nd of November 96, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Now also as far as you're concerned, you initially applied in terms of the first Act, number 35 of 1990, the "Wet of Vrywaring", is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sorry, yes while we're busy, do you prefer speaking English or Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, it's irrelevant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman, can I just sort this out with the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Maree, it's your choice, whatever language you want to speak, please feel free to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Very well, I will give evidence in Afrikaans and English with cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Speak to Mr du Plessis, maybe he has ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, it's sorted out, he will give his evidence-in-chief in Afrikaans and he will answer the cross-examination in English, where applicable, from Mr Kahanovitz.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We won't hold you to that Mr Maree.  If you want to at any stage speak Afrikaans or English, that's up to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Very well Mr Maree let us then  speak Afrikaans at this stage.  So you made that initial application in terms of the Act that is dated the 28th March?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Concerning that application, there was no formal reply to it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, none at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But later you did receive notice that in terms of the Act, in terms of further indemnity, that this first application of yours was referred to the hearing of two Judges in Bloemfontein and indeed it was done on the 9th of December 1993, where you were then represented by Attorney Havenga and Juri Wessels and they argued on behalf of you.  Were you present there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Well, also concerning this, there was no feedback in terms of the publication of the indemnity in the Government Gazette and then the next step was that in terms of the Act of 34/95, you apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And this is now in terms of the incident around Gavin Evans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Now this application of yours, it's now this application that is serving in front of the Commission at this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And you were then assisted by Adv Swiegelaar and you application is in the form of, or with your annexures dated 28th of March 1991, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> We will come back to this at a later stage.  Very well, before we then deal with the matter as such, I think it is necessary for us to allow you to continue and explain to us in your own words, what the background was.  The first issue that I'd like to deal with is your own personal background.  I assume you are a South African citizen and that you grew up in Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr du Plessis, you heard that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I seem to be the culprit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You grew up in Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.  I grew up and schooled in Port Shepstone.  I then joined the police in 1971 and I finished school in 1970.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> If you could just slow down for the interpreter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I apologise.  Directly after school I joined the Police Force and I went to the Police College in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> We are now talking about 1970, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> From there, after the Police College, I went to Pietermaritzburg, from there to Empangeni and from Empangeni Detective Branch to the Brixton Murder and Robbery Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> What year would this be where you joined the Brixton Murder and Robbery Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It was in 1978 or 79.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You were then attached to the Brixton Murder and Robbery Unit up until 1988, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> What was your rank when you started your service?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I was a Warrant Officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> I would just like to deal with the circumstances around the fact that you then left the Police Service.  Can you just in short explain this to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I investigated a murder case or a few murders where the suspects that I identified were Mr le Grange, a former Captain of Murder and Robbery and Robert van der Merwe who was also at the Brixton Murder and Robbery Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> It was the murder of drug smugglers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.  I made my presentation to the Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Who was the Commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It was Col Burger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> This is now Staal Burger who is also an applicant in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes. Because Capt le Grange was an officer,  the dossier was taken from me and then handed over to Pretoria for further investigations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> This Capt le Grange as you've already mentioned, was then an officer at the Brixton Murder and Robbery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> He was a former Captain at Brixton, but he was then part of the East Rand at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But if you say Brixton Murder and Robbery, you say that you knew him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And that is the reason why the file was taken from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well, I assume so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> What - this whole matter round le Grange, what led to it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well, there was certain communication between the Attorney-General's office and certain members at Brixton and also at Head Office, they were asked to transfer certain people and I was amongst them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Where were you transferred to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I was transferred to the Durban Murder and Robbery Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So once again, it was a Murder and Robbery branch.  Was this seen as a reflection on your capacity and your impartiality?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.  I believed it was not because I did anything wrong in the investigation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you then indeed accept that transfer to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, initially I did when I was called to Pretoria, but in the interim stage I was then approached by Col Burger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Well, this now includes the recruitment for the CCB.  If you can just continue and tell us what happened then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Col Burger then approached me and asked me if I was interested in joining the Special Forces, Special Forces asked him to do certain recruitments.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Special Forces of whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> The South African Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> It was then known as the "recce"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.  At that stage I was interested in looking at, or to accept the recruitment, I then attended a meeting where Sterk addressed us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Were there other members who were then later recruited?  Who were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Mr Joe Verster addressed us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was this meeting at a military compound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, it was on the Ponti Building in Hillbrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you say who was present as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It was Calla Botha, Staal Burger and Mr van Zyl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you then accept the appointment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, after I spoke to Mr Verster and he explained to me what this entailed, I considered it and I think two days later I came back to Mr Burger and told him that I accepted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You then resigned from the South African Police Service?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Just in short, the initial description of the unit, the Special Forces Unit of the Defence Force, what did this entail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> What they told me was that it was a covert arm of Special Forces and at that stage I did not have a lot of knowledge concerning Special Forces, so I accepted, as they explained it, covert in the line of the Security Branch of the Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman, there seems to be a problem with Mr Kahanovitz, I don't know whether it's about...</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> It's just to do with the quality of the sound in Afrikaans and it seems to have to do with the position of the microphones and also the speed at which they're speaking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Very well, you are now talking about the covert operations.  So you were under the impression, or you were brought under the impression from the start, that you will not run around in Angola in uniform.  What was your impression then?  Where will you be stationed and what would the circumstances be under which you would work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Initially they told us, because there was a contract or an agreement between the South African Police and the South African Defence Force, there will be a cooling off period of 6 months, thereafter we will get an office in Johannesburg and that did occur.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> In other words you'll be stationed in Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And on that basis you then accepted it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> At that stage of your recruitment, was there any discussion or talk that you would have to act in any illegal way and that would fall in the parameters of your services as the Special Forces of the Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You then mentioned that they told you that there would be a cooling off period of six months.  But just before we get to that, did you receive an official service contract?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I signed it and handed it over to Mr Verster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Now what was your impression?  For what institute or organisation were you working for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> For the Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> The name CCB, was that known to you, that it would be a branch of the Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, not with the first meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But when you joined?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So when you signed the contract, the name was then made known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> This contract I think was, if I can recall correctly, with the organisation and it said CCB, but the word used was organisations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> It has been put to you before that the CCB stood separate from the Defence Force in the sense that the activities of the CCB could not lead back to the Defence Force, do you understand what I mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> This is also how you were informed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, that's how I understood it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But did you understand that you will not be in the service of the Defence Force then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, that it would be a covert organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And your Commander of this specific unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Gen Joubert.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Gen Joubert, did you meet him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I did meet him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So in other words, it was a General that was in full-time employment of the Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So you had no doubt that you were working for a State Organisation and for the Security Forces at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I had no illusion that I worked for the Defence Force, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And that's also where you money came from, the salaries and the funding for certain projects?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> During this cooling-off period, we've also heard other evidence and I do not think it is disputed that there was no activation and you did not really serve in the traditional sense of the word, during that period of 6 months, up until December 1988?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But you did have contact with the organisation, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> By means of whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It was Wouter Basson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Who was know to you as Christo Brits.  Was he ...?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> He was the co-ordinator of Region 6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And this contact during that 6 month period, where did this happen, or how did it happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It was mostly meetings at different hotels in hotel rooms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> What was discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> In short, it was at the start of it, we tried to sort out the documentation.  We had no documentation so we tried to find all of that out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> What your service would entail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Then it's also common cause that you were later activated in January 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And that indeed the course was presented and that you went through this course and amongst others, Joe Verster, Wouter Basson and others addressed you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Am I also correct that it was also the Commanding General, who was Joubert at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Now without dealing with this extensively, what did this course entail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> There were different phases.  Once again the military style of administration.  Because we were Special Forces we did things differently.  We did the writing of documents, the purpose of the organisation was explained to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Being?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Being the disruption of the enemy of the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was the enemy explained to you or spelled out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, at that stage, I think it was common knowledge that it was the ANC, the PAC or the so-called freedom fighters, which we called the terrorists and today are called the freedom fighters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Well, what was put to you in broad terms concerning your functions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> What was put to us, in broader terms was that the day of conventional warfare in South Africa is over, the enemy is now in the country and that we are a similar organisation and we will fight fire with fire and we will adapt our methods to theirs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> What did this entail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It was the elimination of people, the burning of houses or any disruption to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Disruption actions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Would this include fund organisations of the ANC, to act against the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> At that stage you just left the South African Police, what was your perception concerning those circumstances in the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well from the police's side I was aware of it.  I was aware that there were bombs in the country, that bombs were planted against the State, friends of mine, policemen who were blown up, cars that were blown up, so I was aware that the war was in the country, I was aware of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And did you sympathise with the tasks of the South African Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I did, I was part of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Very well, we will at a later stage deal with that area, but was it explained to you how these covert operations would work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, in broader terms they explained to us that the blue plan and a red plan ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> That would be then the cover, to give you access?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And also to give you a legitimate base to work from, from there you would then execute your operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And the red plan would then be the activation in terms of the operations against the enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And with that you confirm what has already been said in terms of the recruitment of unconscious agents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> I'm not going to cover all of that again, but you then indeed after you completed that course, took certain steps to establish a cover for yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> What did you then do in terms of the establishment of a blue plan cover?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well, I established a front company for the export from South Africa to other African countries, electronic appliances, computers, pocket calculators, watches, etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You now said that you established a company, was this a formal company?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> What was the name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It was Lema, L-E-M-A, was the name of the company.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did it stand for something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well, it is the first two letters of my name and then my surname.  The company I established in Johannesburg, funding was approved for the establishment of this company by the Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was this then an official request for funds that you had to do through documentation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Can you recall what type of funds were made available to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> At a certain stage, R40 000 was made available for the company.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> What would you use it for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well it would be the buying of furniture to furnish the offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And to get personnel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct yes, for the first month or two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And did you then use those funds?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I did, some of it, but my plans changed, I did not buy furniture but I started renting furnished offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was this now in a centre where there were offices and also furniture and also personnel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Where were the offices?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> They were in Park Town in Johannesburg and I then gave back the rest of the money until I needed it at a later stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> So if I understand you correctly, you made a monthly withdrawal and rather than using the whole lump sum at the same time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> When you activated this company, was it a business?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, it was a business.  I did business and I also embarked on a - because it was a new area, I'm a policeman, I do not know anything about business and I thought if I had people around me who knew about it, I could learn from them, that's why I started with a very small company.  I then did that and after a few months I started with these things that I exported.  I started making money and then I got a partner to assist me in it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So you then indeed, to put it this way, you had a bona fide business?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was the idea of this whole system that you would have a believable cover or was it only a door where there's nothing going on behind it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I understood and later I went into it a bit further, that it was very important to have a good foundation, a very good blue plan.  To get access you need, if somebody asks you, you must seem legitimate.  If somebody comes to your office, it must seem as if there's things going on and I tried to do this to the best of my abilities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So it is a question where in the community you want to establish yourself as a businessman, it's not just a front door, you must indeed run a business and people must trust you doing it and you then did it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> At the, or during this initial term from January to March, we also heard evidence that there were basically provinces given to the different members of Region 6 on the ground floor level, that was yourself and Mr Botha and you had to concentrate on these areas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But you were not always applied in these areas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And that KwaZulu Natal was given to you so that you could also establish yourself there and that would be the province on which you would focus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Why was this done?  Is there any specific reason for this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well, because I went to school there and I grew up there and I knew Natal and I assume that was the reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But out of your evidence before, it seemed that if you were to ...(indistinct) as a detective or policeman and you did not work in Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It's true, I knew the area but I've lost contact with a lot of the people there, but I went back to look up old friends and to make contact with them again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Very well.  Did you also extend your business activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I also established a company in Durban that provided goods to ships coming in and once again I got a partner to run the business to give me the freedom to move around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> He did not know what was going on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> He was completely unconscious, he did not know what was going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And was this once again a normal branch or office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It was not the same type of work as the first company. I provided goods to ships that came into the harbour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Can you still recall the name of the company?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Capall, C-A-P-A-L-L.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was it once again a formal company?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You say that this company did indeed run the business and did do business.  Did you make use of the funds?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, the Lema office in Johannesburg, I just took one or two months of their profit to make use, to buy furniture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So you were running the Lema business at a profit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And you used that money to create the company in Natal.  If I understand you correctly, it was not against the rules of the CCB, it was indeed the policy of the CCB that you will have a legitimate business, you will establish this business from which you can then draw a salary or that you can make a living with it and you were supported in this, that you were going to make a profit in it and make use of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.  I did run it in terms of the profit, but it was not the purpose to get a salary from it, but I got a salary from the Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> It wasn't a factor however, this is now from the profits of the company?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But you had to make a profit otherwise the company would not exist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Just to come back to what you have already said to us.  You spoke to us about CAPALL, the other company that did business, to come back to Lema, this company you say did exports to what country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well, it was Zambia, Swaziland, Botswana, African countries around us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did this include Namibia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Botswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Zimbabwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Zambia, not Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Very well.  Did you personally, in order to further your exports, did you travel to these countries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> What was the purpose of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> To receive business or to get business from those countries.   Because I didn't have people on the grassroots level, I don't have experience, so I wen to the Chambers of Commerce in these countries and they referred me to companies, gave me names and contracts with companies I can do business with, so I can then choose whom I want to deal with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And this was in the furthering of your business in terms of the blue plan?  You had no illusions that you would then, or the fact that you could move freely in those countries, that it can be an advantage for the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct, that was the purpose thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say it was the purpose thereof, when you were to focus on Natal, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> To give me freedom of movement, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but I mean your function in the CCB wasn't it to focus on KwaZulu Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So in what way would it be beneficial to the CCB if you could wander around freely in Namibia or Zambia or Swaziland or Botswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Not necessarily to do that.  On the course we were told that we must access freedom of movement wherever we want to and that's what I tried to do there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  And then perhaps just to clarify the point which was touched upon by the Chairperson a few moments ago, if I understand you correctly, these activities of yours, the establishment of Lema, the exports, the movements in the African countries, all of this took place in January, February, March, April of 1989, the initial months?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, the first few months of 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Now as a result of this successful establishment of Lema and the exports particularly, was there any movement in the CCB as a result of this, especially with regard to its functions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> There was another company which I established, yes.  I also established Lema in Windhoek, in Namibia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was it a branch of Lema?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, it was a company on it's own, it was Lema, Namibia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was it also an incorporated company?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> In Windhoek?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And regarding these activities of yours, was there ever any change with regard to the CCB's plans with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.  Later I was called in by Mr Burger and I was asked whether I would be interested in working in Germany.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And then with regard to Africa, can you give us an indication of when the Germany offer came about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>If we could just establish the course of time.  We've examined January to April, that was the African situation and then emanating there from, did you follow any courses or anything like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Out of my own, I followed a business management course because I was a layman, I didn't really know much and I needed to learn more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> At which institution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> At Executive Education.  It was a very basic Management course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Who paid for the course?  The CCB actually?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, the CCB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And this question that you would focus abroad and ultimately in Germany, was this your own initiative or was it from the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> From the CCB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And was this based upon your successful activities in other African Countries, as you have just explained to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I think it was based upon my blue companies which had been successfully established that they functioned efficiently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was your function then at that point when you were asked to focus or concentrate on foreign countries, was your focus still specifically on KwaZulu Natal in the sense that it was your job?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I was told to work in Natal, but I viewed this over the long term and I thought that I should first establish a sound basis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> That would include Capall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> The company that included Capall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, it gave me the freedom to move to Durban because I had to work in Natal.  I had a reason to go to Durban without any questions being asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Now the establishment of blue plans and the establishment of a credible front for the CCB, was this a sort of crises management which was executed over the short term, or was it a long term plan?  What was your perception?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It was my perception that it was a long term plan, that it had to be done proficiently.  That is what I tried to do.  I tried to establish a sound basis.  I viewed it in the long term and I was also told that it was a long term thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So you were told so?  Why were you told so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I was told so by Mr Burger, Mr Verster and during the course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was any pressure exerted on you to deliver so-called production with regard to the projects and execution of such projects?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, it was said that this was a significant phase, the establishment of an efficient blue plan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You see, because questions have been put here, among others, by the Chairperson that it seems somewhat difficult to understand that the person Chappies Maree, as he is known, is in disfavour with Mr Slang van Zyl with regard to production.  It would appear that you were there for nine months, and with the exception of Gavin Evans, nothing happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, it must be so, we had different working methods.  My blue plan entrapped me in the sense that I found myself in a situation for a number of months where I didn't know anything about business, but I had to deal with businesses and staff members and I was caught up in the whole idea of running a business, rather than delivering production.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Later we will deal in specific terms with Gavin Evans, but it is common cause that in approximately March 1989, an instruction came your way with regard to Gavin Evans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And that you indeed executed your instruction with regard to that.  It is not common cause as such perhaps, but you could perhaps inform us regarding this.  What was your precise instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I was given a document, or at least a document was shown to me by Mr Basson and I was given an instruction to trace Gavin Evans' address and his place of employment.  I had to try and trace him between these two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Very well.  We will deal with the details later.  Did you do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And you sent the information back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I gave them feedback.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you continue with the project?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> It is on record that Mr van Zyl ultimately received an order to execute a project regarding Gavin Evans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Were you involved in the execution of that project in any way whatsoever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> As I've said, we will return to the details of that later.  Why were you not involved?  Why was it taken away from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Because I must have taken too long with it.  It wasn't that it wasn't important to me but I was caught up in the blue plan business and the establishment of these businesses, so I was more in Natal to establish Capall, than what I was here at that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Were you told what you were supposed to concentrate on when the Gavin Evans project was taken away from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> What I had to concentrate on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes what you were supposed to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> In Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> No, in general.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I was involved with the blue plan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Very well.  So were there any problems in the CCB with regard to the fact that you had to continue with the blue plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I assumed that they were happy that this was done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> That it was going well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You've already referred to the course that you did for a month.  Was it a full-time course?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And that was for the month of May?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, it was during May.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So that brings us to the end of May 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Which is five months on from January at that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> After the completion of this course, which you did with the good blessings of the CCB along with their finance, what happened furthermore with regard to CCB activities?  Were you still involved with the blue plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And were there any other projects, so to speak, which came to your side, or any other instructions that you had to execute for the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, there were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Could you explain this to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I had to do a placement of a person in Namibia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Who was this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Donald Aitchison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Do you have personal knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the recruitment of Mr Aitchison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you regard Mr Aitchison as an aware or an unaware, or unconscious member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> An unconscious member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> From whom did you receive the order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> From Mr Burger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Very well.  If we examine the time schedule surrounding Aitchison's placement, can you recall more or less when it would have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Approximately June, July or August in 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> July or August?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Just to view this in context, during these periods did you often travel abroad?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> With reference to African countries, that is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And in this period of June, July and August, during this time, did you visit any European countries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Which country specifically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Greece.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> With what purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Once again, the expansion of a company, to try to promote my blue plan, with a businessman, I went with a businessman to try to establish this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you only go to Greece at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Who financed this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> The CCB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And so it was official business in promotion of the blue plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And nobody complained about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You stated that you also visited Namibia and that indeed you incorporated Lema as a company in Windhoek.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.  I could not do or practice the company as a singular unit, that is why I had to establish Lema B in Windhoek.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Can you recall precisely when this was?  We can use a general time period if you want.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It was approximately with my return from Greece.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So it would have been in July or August as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> More or less the same time when Aitchison was placed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.  The company was registered before Aitchison was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So it was shortly before that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, because I had been there previously to purchase a company in Namibia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> What sort of company?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It was just to look for a company to acquire in Namibia.  I knew what I was doing at that point, because I wanted to establish Lema there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And did Lema in Namibia do any good business?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, it didn't, it was registered, but it didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was this particular company incorporated with Aitchison in mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did it not have anything to do with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> It was still a bona fide expansion of the blue plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> This trip to Greece and the examination of Europe, upon whose initiative was this done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> The CCB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Once again, the question originates that originally you were told to examine KwaZulu Natal and the next thing you find yourself in the Greek Islands, which is a little far from KwaZulu Natal.  How did this happen?  Was this the long term vision regarding the activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> At that stage I didn't know, now I know that there was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Were you told to expand to Europe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Mr Burger told me, and that is what I tried to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Very well and eventually you went to Germany as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> When was your first time that you visited Germany, can you recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> August, approximately, I cannot recall precisely, it was August 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You went to Germany?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And was this once again an instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> To do what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> To do a pre-study for a transfer to there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So at that point it was the vision that you would ultimately settle in Europe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.  Mr Burger called me in and asked me how I would feel about settling permanently in Germany, about being stationed there and I was in favour of it.  They sent me to Germany to expand the blue plan of Lema once again, to give me movement room to contact German companies and that is what I did.  I placed advertisements in newspapers, made contact with business people, I examined the schooling systems and went to establish office space and to obtain housing.  I went to examine the scene for this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And you did it in the end?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So at that stage the entire focus of your activities was actually from the internal side to the external side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And during this same period of time that we have referred to, you received an instruction to handle Aitchison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And did you indeed physically meet with Aitchison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> The first time was at a hotel in Norwood, thereafter in Swaziland and then again in Namibia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Very well.  And was funding made available by the CCB for the establishment of Aitchison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> In Namibia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman, unfortunately I will have to deal with the whole Lubowski/Aitchison saga in view of the questions that have been put here to different witnesses, so although Mr Maree did not ask for amnesty in this regard, there's nothing in terms of my instructions he  had to ask for amnesty for.  I have to place this within the bigger picture, when we're dealing with Mr Gavin Evans, so at this stage I'm dealing with this.  Therefore you say that you went to establish Aitchison there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And did you also meet him personally in Namibia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And did you conduct the establishment there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry just before you proceed.  This word establishment, what did it entail to establish Aitchison?  Was that just to recruit him as an unaware member, or did you employ him at Lema, fix him up with a job, or what are you talking about when you say you had to establish Aitchison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> He was already recruited Sir, so I had to establish him in South West, in Namibia, by settling him in, getting him housing and seeing if I could get him a job and a motor vehicle and moving his family there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Perhaps we could deal with this briefly.  So with regard to Aitchison, if we understand your evidence correctly, it was not a short term thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I was instructed to place Aitchison in Namibia and there was also a plan for him to be a so-called English sleeper because Namibia was on the verge of its reawakening at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> If I recall correctly, the election took place approximately during August in 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was funding made available by the CCB as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And you said that he had to take his family there, did he have a family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I don't know if it was his wife, I think he also had two children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And the lady who was going with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, so originally there was a problem, he would have had to wait a month because the school times for the children were not suitable and I had to get quotes for his family, the Defence Force wanted three quotes for the transportation of his furniture to Namibia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So he was established in Namibia at that point, but his family was yet to follow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And the arrangements for this were underway?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And he agreed to go and stay there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And at that point, was there any particular instruction which Mr Aitchison had to execute there that you knew of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, he had to try and get a job, but I also told him that the job wasn't the most important, because we would be paying him a salary while he was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So he was already receiving funding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes and there was also a problem with housing because in Windhoek there wasn't a lot of housing because UNTAG was in Windhoek at that stage, so all the housing was occupied, but he did find a garden cottage with somebody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And that was also another reason why his wife and family couldn't join him, because the housing situation hadn't been sorted out yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And he did get a job.  Did you find the job for him, or did he find it himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, he found it himself.  He was a journalist and a cartoon sketcher so he managed to get the job himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you have any instructions for him with regard to illegal activities that he had to execute there with regard to the political situation and the intimidation or murder of persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, nothing whatsoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you yourself have such orders which you would ultimately have to send through to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> If I understand you correctly, your instruction was merely to establish him there for later usage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.  I did not recruit him either, I was simply given a document and I was told to go and meet this man and to establish him in Namibia, that is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Very well.  We are now aware of the fact that at a certain point Adv Anton Lubowski was murdered in Namibia, the date being the 12th of September.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Where were you on the 12th of September?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> In Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Had you visited Namibia at any point during that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I was in and out of Namibia.  Four days before Mr Lubowski's death I was in Namibia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you have anything whatsoever to do with the death of Lubowski?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you have any knowledge that it was going to happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> We will deal with the following matter at a later point.  By nature of the situation it became known to you that Mr Aitchison was indeed arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Now with regard to his recruitment by a certain Knox police officer who introduced him to Mr Barnard who was then handed over to Mr Botha and brought in to the CCB, did you have any knowledge of that background?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You said that you regarded him as an unconscious member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> It would appear from the evidence that he was conscious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> If this whole situation had been known to you, would you have placed your man there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It was my order.  If I had known, in retrospect it is easier to say, but I think I might have acted differently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> It is clear that there was no particular cut-off date or point with Mr Aitchison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, from my side I followed it through as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Someone else other than Mr Botha who received him from Mr Barnard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> While we are on the subject, were you at any stage aware of Mr Barnard's application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You or any other members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I knew Mr Barnard from the police, but I didn't know about anything else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So you knew him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I knew him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Were you aware of his involvement with the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> With Region 7 specifically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> In terms of the structure as it existed then, would Mr Barnard's application - let me rather not deal with that.  You have stated that you were not aware of his application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> After it became known that Aitchison was arrested, what were the actions thereafter or the reaction at the very least?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I was called in and told to break off all contact with Aitchison, which is what I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So regarding you, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> My cut-off points were correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> After Aitchison's arrest, did you continue with your CCB activities in the sense of the proposed establishment in Germany?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So it was not suspended?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And did you return to Germany?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I did, in December of that year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> December 1989?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So were further funds made available for you in that regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> The trip to Germany at that point, was it still with the objective that you were supposed to establish yourself there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.  Me and my partner from Lema went together.  He was not aware of what I was involved with, but I took him with to Germany.  The Defence Force paid for it.  We went to make acquisitions and while we were there, we dealt with the other business that he was indeed aware of, that we were looking for contact points and persons in Germany.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And while you were in Germany, were there any developments in South Africa with regard to the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, there were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> I'm referring to the arrest of Calla Botha in December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Also the arrest of Mr Slang van Zyl in January, just the following year, 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Which then threw the entire CCB into turmoil.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And what emanated from that?  Did you receive any orders from that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> While I was in Germany or in Europe, I received an instruction to remain there, but that my partner had to return.  This was the first time when my partner was informed of what was really going on because I didn't really have any other choice.  My co-ordinator told me what had happened, he told me that Mr Botha had been arrested and that Mr van Zyl had been arrested.  He returned after I had informed him precisely of what was going on.  The other staff members still didn't know what the real situation was and he returned to inform them of the actual position.  I remained and waited for further instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> This entire movement which took place surrounding the CCB was established to a greater extent by the fact that the police of Namibia, which at that stage had become independent and particularly Jumbo Smit, was conducting investigations in South Africa into the Lubowski case and it was in terms of this that you were instructed to remain where you were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You've already said that with regard to the Lubowski murder you did not perform any role nor did you have any knowledge of the incident itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But by nature of the situation, there are fingers which pointed in your direction over the years and particularly those of a certain Judge Levy, you are aware of his finding that the CCB in Region 6 and particularly your name was mentioned and that you were to have been involved in the matter according to his findings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I deny this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Very well.  The final point with regard to the Lubowski matter that I would like to deal with is the report of the TRC to the State President, which was submitted here as Exhibit D.  This matter is dealt with in terms of Lubowski.  There are just one or two aspects about this that I would like to touch upon with you.  Before I get to that, however, after your involvement with the CCB, we know that the Harms Commission came into being early in 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And you returned from Germany?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And you were here at the time of the Harms Commission being in session?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And subsequently the CCB was disbanded and your services were terminated with the CCB by means of a package system?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And it is common cause that from 1991 onwards you once again became involved with the South African Defence Force but with the Department of Covert Collections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, the DCC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And until when were you involved there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Until 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> That is the same matter regarding which Mr Wouter Basson gave evidence, namely that there was an investigation by the Goldstone Commission of Inquiry and as a result of this your services were promptly terminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Just to return to the report which I've already mentioned, the TRC report.  Mr Chairman I see that the pages are not numbered, it's Exhibit D, one of the pages deals with the killing of Anton Lubowski, but it's not numbered in my bundle or my Exhibit, it's paragraph 1.4.1. and further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> As far as I remember we referred to the specifics paragraphs for record purposes and perhaps you should just continue to do that.  They're all numbered, as far as I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> We'll refer to them by paragraph then.  They deal there in paragraph 1.4.6. with the fact that Judge Levy then made certain findings in which you and Chappies Maree were implicated.  Are you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And then I can see that Mr Ferdi Barnard's name is also mentioned here as well as a Charles Wilscoat, formerly Nielsen, do you know of such a person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Ferdi Barnard, you do confirm that you knew him before your involvement at the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> The other people are Joe Verster, Staal Burger, Abram Slang van Zyl, Calla Botha and yourself and Wouter Basson and it is then Region 6 as well as the Director General, Joe Verster.  Then Johan Niemoller is mentioned, do you know anything about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Then Schutte we've already dealt with, you also say you do not know him.  Then there's reference to a Christoffel Nel and if you follow the evidence here, it is very clear that it is one Derek from the CCB, this is in paragraph 1.7., did you know this person during your involvement at the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Paragraph 1.4.8., said that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a>"What I've said is it's well established that the CCB was set up as a covert grouping with the purpose, amongst others, of killing political opponents.  So too is the fact that prior to the Lubowski killing, such opponents were subject to extensive target identification or intelligence gathering operations.  It has been established that Lubowski was the subject of such an exercise, an operation conducted by the West Front, South West Africa and Angola section of the Directorate of Cover Collection, DCC, then headed by Brig Koos Louw.  His Deputy Major Geoffrey Burton Price, also known as Arthur Wiltshire, was in charge of the South West African arena."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a>Now at that stage, we now know that you joined DCC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> That was in 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> We are now talking about 1989 with the death of Lubowski.  Did you have any contact at that stage with DCC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I did not even know they existed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> The Defence Force, DCC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well I did not know anything about them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> At that stage, did you know Brig Koos Louw at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And Major Geoffrey Burton Price?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I only met him later when I joined the DCC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> What was Price's background?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> He was an ex-Rhodesian from the CIO.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> What is CIO?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Central Intelligence Organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> From the old Rhodesia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> In other words, he had a military background?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, he had a military background from Rhodesia, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Very well.  Then there's reference made in paragraph 149</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a>"The actual eavesdropping operation was undertaken by the tenant Johannes Frederik Verster."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a>If I'm correct, I think it was also Rich Verster.  Do you know this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you know him in 1989?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I met him at a later stage.  I heard about him before he was involved in - I think he went to jail for - I think some Zulu clan hired him to shoot another clan and I think he went to jail for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> He was a convicted murderer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>MR P DU PLESSIS</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a>"Who provided this information to the Commission.  Verster was still running the surveillance eavesdropping exercise at the time Lubowski was shot.  He told the Commission that he was shot by the killing because we were recruiting him"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a>That refers to Lubowski,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a>"and it was the wrong person every to have shot.  He was instructed to return to South Africa immediately after the shooting."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a>Out of this it's very clear that Rich Verster was involved at DCC during the Lubowski murder, 12th September, 1989.  Are you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Are you aware of the fact of the activities of DCC in Namibia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Of any other Intelligence organisation in Namibia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> A lot of them were involved, but I personally did not know of any operations by any intelligence organisation or any country's Intelligence Services.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> At that stage, that is September 1989?</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Then I have to deal with that.  There is a quote from evidence or a testimony of Rich Verster with reference to certain people that I'd like to ask if you know them.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a>"When I got into Pretoria, I was summoned to go and see Koos Louw and also Tolletjie Botha, head of DCC. I explained to them what had happened.  They went to an office with me.  He, Botha, picked up the telephone and he phoned South West Africa, the Head of the Prison Department and also the police and he said:  'We'll have to use the old boys network.'  They phoned up the Brigadier in South West Africa and asked what happened.  'Have they got Aitchison?'  They said yes, they have."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a>Now resulting from this, we've already dealt with Koos Louw, Tolletjie Botha, the former head of DCC, did you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I knew him, not then, later when I was transferred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Is it correct if I say that he is dead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was he also the Commander while you were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But in September 89 you did not know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I did not know him, also not Koos Louw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Here they make mention that immediately after Lubowski's death, DCC or Rich Verster's evidence was aware of Aitchison's existence as well as his arrest, or certain information was sought after his arrest.  Do you know if DCC knew about Aitchison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And you did not do anything that would make that information available to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Then lastly, on this aspect, it is possibly so that Mr Aitchison was indeed responsible for the death of Adv Anton Lubowski.  Were you at any stage aware of this?  Did you contribute to it in any way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> There are other aspects that I'm not going to go into now, where Aitchison's apparently said that he had to kill Gwen Lister and for that he had poison, do you know anything about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you at any stage have poison or tablets in your capacity as a member of the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Do you know if any poisonous materials were found at Aitchison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Nothing was said about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I never heard about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Very well, I think this concludes this whole situation, concerning this, placed in context as well as with your business activities.  To then come back to the whole matter, the reason why you are here, the whole matter around Gavin Evans, we've already placed it in perspective that these events surrounding Gavin Evans were in March 1989, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You've already said to us what your instructions were, what you received from the co-ordinator Mr Christo Brits, real name Wouter Basson, who already testified.  At that stage were you aware of what the final project would entail concerning Gavin Evans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, not at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Out of your involvement in the CCB, did you consider the possibility that what you are doing may lead to the project concerning Mr Evans, that may include his elimination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I did realise this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And this is now also why you indeed applied for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Maybe, while we're dealing with this point, with regards to the other projects that we dealt with, the other members and the whole situation around the planned death of Mr Dullah Omar, the Athlone Bomb and the Apie project, did you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Then just to come back to Evans, the name that was given to you, what was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It was Gavin Evans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was the name Michael Evans ever given to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, it was only Gavin Evans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So did you know what information you had to get and how you had to deal with the situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, it was around Gavin Evans, I knew he was a journalist at the Weekly Mail.  He was a sports writer and that's how I identified him.  I could not - because I did not have people on ground level, it would be really difficult to do it yourself, you have to use other people to do it.  I could not personally make inquiries concerning his address.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Just on that point, you say that this person was a sports writer.  Was he known to you beforehand during that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Were you aware that he was a sports writer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, after I made certain - I found this out at a later stage, actually.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you have a physical description?</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, there was a photograph available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> A photograph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So you could then identify this person as Gavin Evans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> After your information functions, what did you do with the photograph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I gave it back to Wouter Basson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Is it possible that this is the photograph that was then at a later stage made available?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I'm sure it was the same photograph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> We are now talking about March 1989, you said that you could not go and look for the address yourself, why is this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I could have done it yes, but I saw it as a covert operation and it would not work if I did it myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you have anybody to assist you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I couldn't use anybody to go in, to find out where he worked and to monitor his work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Were you willing to take the same risk as what Mr Botha ran and not be caught out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, but what I did - I was not aware that Mr Botha did this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But this was only at a later stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, but what I did was that I pretended over the telephone that I was a friend of his, because he did not want to give his address.  This was at the newspaper where he worked.  I then got somebody else on the line and I asked them where he lives and this lady gave me his address and that is then the address that I gave to Mr Basson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Could you inquire about further facts that surrounded him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, it was not that I thought that it was a very small project, but at that stage I was quite involved in my blue plan and that is why I didn't really give more attention to it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So you did not physically do any monitoring to gather more information concerning his movements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> This address that you found out, did you then give this to the co-ordinator?</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And were you then in any way further involved in this project?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No that was the end of my part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> There was evidence of Mr van Zyl that he thinks, he's of the opinion that you were present when he received the instruction to bring the people from the Cape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> To execute this project, he then later under questioning said that he's not quite sure about.  Were you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you have any contact or role in the execution of the project concerning the planning of the death of Mr Gavin Evans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you at any stage make a pre-study concerning Mr Gavin Evans in the formal sense of the word, concerning the CCB and how they functioned, how they planned his death, that he would be killed with a knife, that it would look like a robbery, etc?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well, the address that I got from this lady from the Weekly Mail, I handed it over to Mr Basson and that was the last aspect that I dealt with.  I had nothing further to do with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> It is so that you deal with this aspect concerning Mr Gavin Evans in your amnesty application that appears or that is then based on the document that was written or submitted in December 1991 and at that stage you were represented by this same legal team as Mr Burger and Basson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And these documents were all compiled by the same person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And you also take responsibility for this document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And is it also so, I'm not going to deal with it in detail, but that there are certain mistakes contained in this document, especially surrounding the question if you would then have gathered information surrounding Mr Gavin Evans or that he was involved in undermining operations against the State?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It was not my task.  It is written there though, but it was not my task.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And then if you then could find evidence that he was involved in undermining operations against the State, that you would then act against him.  Was that the instruction that you were given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, it was not the instruction.  It appeared in the application as a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You've already said that Gavin Evans was unknown to you, but when they gave you instructions to find the address, did you know what organisation he belonged to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I knew that he was from the ECC and that's what Mr Basson said to me, End Conscription Campaign.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was this organisation known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> This was now independently of any information that you had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well, that was from the newspapers and everybody knew about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> What were the activities of this organisation, was that the destabilisation of the Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well, that was to break down the morale of the Defence Force in that they do not follow orders, that they were called up to serve and they did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And to add to this, this whole involvement of the CCB, was this based on any specific political philosophies that you personally followed or supported?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well, the politics did count yes, I was in the police for 20 years.  I grew up Afrikaans.  I also supported the apartheid Government, although you do not find them anymore, everybody just disappeared overnight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But you are willing to admit it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> With hindsight you can look back and say that yes, it didn't work, that it was not necessary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> What was your opinion  concerning the Republic of South Africa at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I saw it in the same light, or because I was involved in the cover things, I saw it in the same way as the Israelis saw their homeland, that it belongs to them and that the sovereignty of it must be protected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> That the Israelis are still doing now today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Although we do see today that it's not necessary in this country, that we can live together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But at that stage that was your political philosophy, that you wanted to protect the State or the Government and your functions in the CCB, you saw that in the light of the philosophy as you just explained it.  Is that why you were willing to destabilise the enemy of the State of that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, that is all in chief.</p>

<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Maree if I understood your evidence correctly, then you were simply involved in the Evans case because you had to find an address?</p>

<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Mr Maree, when you had to establish Mr Evans' address, I assume you were aware that the reason you were being called on to perform this task was that it was related to some or other plan to take steps against Mr Evans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> What were the nature of the steps that were likely to be taken?  What had you been told at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I hadn't been told anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But, were you given any file, apart from the photographs that you've referred to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  So you were ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Mr Kahanovitz, if I may just intervene.  Didn't you ever - am I mistaken, I thought you said Mr Basson showed you a document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I wasn't given a file, he showed me a document with his address on, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Thank you.  So he showed you a document with his address on it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Sorry, I beg your pardon, with Gavin Evans' name on it and a photograph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes.  What else was on the document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So you were aware that steps were to be taken against Mr Evans, but you weren't informed of the detail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But you would have been aware, given the nature of the CCB's activities, that in all likelihood, those steps would be unlawful?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So to use the words from your training course, it would have been anything from breaking his windows to eliminating him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Now I take it from your evidence-in-chief that you are quite happy to talk about external activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> And it would appear to me that the reason for that is that you are saying "Yes, I was deployed outside of the Republic, but there is nothing which I did outside of the Republic which was illegal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.  In some European countries, there are operations which I won't talk about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You see, because I'm a bit confused.  I distinctly got the impression from your evidence-in-chief that you were being led as a witness who was giving us a summary of the broad spectrum of your activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Inside and outside of South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> I didn't hear you say in your evidence-in-chief:  "I'm telling you about some of the things that I'm involved in overseas, but I'm not telling you about certain other things that I'm involved in overseas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman, may I just speak to my client for a moment please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I'm prepared to speak about any overseas operations, anything where I was involved in, which I have made available through my lawyer.  In certain instances I prefer not to mention names of people who assisted me overseas for their own safety.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Just forgetting for a minute about naming names, did you - so you're saying whether or not your activities were illegal, you are prepared to talk about them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Have you, in your evidence-in-chief broadly covered both your lawful and unlawful activities outside of the Republic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So you're telling us you haven't left anything important out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Mr Kahanovitz, just on that question.  What unlawful activities did you have overseas, because you've just answered a question saying you've covered both your lawful and unlawful activities overseas and my interpretation of your evidence, well I didn't hear, I can't recall having heard anything unlawful overseas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Mr Chairman, certain things I may have done overseas, may amount in that country to espionage or something, it could just be going through that country and doing something, that I've done, but there was instruction to go and do anything unlawful overseas, that's what I mean.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> If I understand, just in broad terms, all you ever did overseas was, let's forget about Namibia for a minute, all you ever did was establish business contacts.  It may be that at some stage in the future, that business front or those business contacts were to be used for some other purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But as I understood your evidence, up to the point that you left the CCB, whatever business initiatives you had launched outside of the Republic were never used for purposes of spying, for instance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Or for any other unlawful purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> What you appear to be saying in your evidence-in-chief was that you were aware that if Staal Burger says to you:  "Here Mr Maree, here's the money to go to Germany.  Go to Germany, here's the money to start a business, etc, etc, he's not doing that for your personal benefit, he's doing that because he intends to deploy you at some stage in the future to perform CCB activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> All you're really saying is up until the time that the CCB was disbanded, you were never informed what the nature of those activities would be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But surely it must have been intimated to you what the nature of those activities would be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, it wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So you were happily going off to - planning to go and live in Germany and you had no idea in your own mind after you'd moved your family there, moved into a house, established business and so on and so forth, you had no idea in your own mind what tasks you might be called upon to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I think that would be speculation.  Any intelligence work, you'd have to put a base down and then you would receive your instructions as to whatever you had to do once you were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes, but we know you weren't working for the NIA or a pure intelligence gathering organisation.  We know you were working for the CCB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> And that the CCB did not exist for the purposes of gathering pure intelligence, that's been the evidence all along.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So if you were being sent to Germany, you weren't being sent there merely to collect information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I don't think  you quite understand.  Everybody in the CCB weren't operators who had to go and eliminate people, there were back-up people as well and logistics people to help people, so everybody, if you worked in the CCB, it doesn't necessarily mean that, as the evidence said that's what the CCB does, there has to be back-up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> What do you mean when you say there has to be back-up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> For example, in Europe, arranging safe houses, finances, logistics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes, I can understand that you need to find out where the target lives, you need to plan escape routes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, that's not what I said, no, that's not my evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Well what are you going to use your safe house for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, no, not for me.  If somebody else in the unit needed to use it, the host agent in that particular country, because he would know the local conditions, could assist in doing that, arranging a house and things like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Right.  So you were going to be the CCB's man in Germany?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well, this is what I presumed, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  Why Germany?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So you went through all these stages and you agree to move to Germany and you had absolutely no idea in your own mind why the CCB was in the least bit interested in Germany?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you not ask?  Did you not say well, why not Belgium, or some other country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, Sir, they asked me or they told me that they need somebody established in Germany and I went along with it.  I had no reason to ask why.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You see, it's easier for us to understand here when we know that the ANC had bases, if you talk about Zambia and so on, or Angola, everybody understands that evidence and why the CCB might be interested in operating in Zambia or Angola.  Why might the CCB need a safe house in Germany, that's what we don't understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I can't answer that.  I don't know.  I didn't make the decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Okay.  But what's also interesting is, I don't know if you were here, but neither Mr Burger certainly made no mention of the evidence that you've just given, so he can't help us.  Do you speak German?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whereabouts did you actually establish in Germany?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> In Stuttgart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> And you also have no idea why it would be Stuttgart, as opposed to Berlin or Munich?</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Mr Burger just told you go to Stuttgart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, no, I went to Munich first and then from there to Stuttgart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes, but who said:  "Go to Stuttgart?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I did it on my own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Why Stuttgart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's where my business contacts for the Lema contract was with them, most of the businesses were in the Stuttgart area, that's why I decided on Stuttgart, in place of Munich.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> And what kind of business was Lema going to do there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I placed advertisements for German business partners in German newspapers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> To perform what sort of business?</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Trade with South African business.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But what form of trade?  What was going to be sold?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I asked for German products in South Africa, agricultural products and from South Africa, the other way around, sorry.  Agricultural products from South Africa electronic stuff from Germany and I received on that about 20 or 30 replies with people we would like to meet and most of them were from the Stuttgart area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I just interpose, Mr Kahanovitz, while you're looking at your papers?  What puzzles me is that you seem to have gone to establishing a base in Germany without any guidelines whatsoever.  You see, if one's going to establish a base somewhere, surely you must have in your mind a broad picture of what objectives you're going to have.  What purpose is that base going to serve.  What are the broad nature of the operations that are going to be conducted, so that you can have an appropriate structure in place to serve whatever purposes you're going to need.  You didn't have any of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> What I had, I think, is I had a reasonably successful blue plan here and I think they wanted the same thing in Germany, if I could establish the same kind of base in Germany.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But you see you're saying:  "I think this is what they wanted."</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well, there was nothing else given to me Sir, this is what they told me.  As what you've done here, see if you can establish in Germany.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see it just sounds so improbable that here they would go and spend all this money, send someone to Germany, move your family there and you, the person on the ground, don't actually know what it is that you're setting all this up for.  You're setting it up as the blue plan.  so this was just an extension of your blue plan, without any other guidelines at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Nothing at all.  I was to establish myself in Germany as what I had done in Natal and in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> And what have safe houses to do with blue plans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, this was speculation when you asked me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  So you're saying the only thing you could think of when I asked you what you might be doing in Germany was that you speculated that it might have involved, at some stage in the future, finding safe houses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, your question was what did I think somebody could be used for in Germany and as an example I said maybe to get somebody a safe house or something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Would it make more sense to you if your version was something along the lines of:  "We had a discussion about where I should be placed in Germany.  It was said to me that the ANC has got an office in Berlin therefore it was suggested that I place myself in Berlin so that we could monitor their activities"?  I would understand your evidence if that had been your evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I can't give that evidence because that's not what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  Now weren't you sent to Europe to arrange for the import of high tech military equipment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> During the stay in Germany if something like that had to come up, as I testified in the criminal case, then I was to try and acquire that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Tell us about this criminal case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I can't remember the accused's name anymore.  There was somebody caught taking currency out the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> And he said the CCB and I in particular went to the Reserve Bank and drew ten million rand or something.  I was responsible for it, so I testified on behalf of the State that this was not the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  But did you not give evidence in that case that you were sent by the CCB to operate as a covert agent for the import of high tech military equipment and that to this end you had undertaken a four month trip to six European countries in early 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I did not testify, if you check the record, that I ran an agent in Europe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Excuse me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I did not testify that I ran and agent in Europe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> I wasn't asking you if you ran an agent, I'm asking you whether you gave evidence to the effect that the CCB sent you to Europe to attempt to broker business deals to purchase high tech military equipment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> They did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.  That was my evidence and that was part of the brief while I was there if this did come up, I was supposed to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Now understand correctly.  You agree you gave that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But are you telling us now that that evidence might not have been true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  Well if your evidence was true, it follows that the CCB sent you to Europe to try and broker business deals to purchase high tech military equipment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I can't understand what the difference is.  I agree with this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You agree with me.  Fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what Mr Kahanovitz is getting to you, was that your brief when you went to Europe or part of your brief was to go and try to broker deals to get military equipment back to South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, this was not with the initial planting.  This happened at a later trip to Germany.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Can you ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> There was more than one trip to Germany.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes, what year are we talking about when the purchase of military equipment first ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> 1990.  Alright.  Did you go on a four month trip to several European countries in early 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Did you broker business deals for the acquisition of raw material for the South African Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I tried.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You tried.  Did any of those deals succeed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> There was still a United Nations Resolution in effect at that stage, as I understand, that weapons could not be sold to South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> In other words, you were attempting to engage in what has been referred to as sanctions busting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Now ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Sorry Chairperson, in the interests of time, what is the relevance of this to the acts for which this applicant seeks amnesty?  I'm only objecting to this just because of time constraints.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Do I need to answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He's asked for it, but my understanding is that the evidence-in-chief was led to include the activities of Mr Maree, no only in Namibia but also abroad, to put the whole operation relating to Evans in perspective.  That's what Mr du Plessis said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Sure Chairperson, but there must be relevance to what we're doing here, otherwise we could carry on for ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think if - Mr Kahanovitz, you realise that we are limited with time and we are essentially only concerned with the Gavin Evans operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> I understand that Mr Chairman.  I will - I think the point is fairly obvious, but I'll make it more obvious in a minutes.  Mr Maree, if I can endeavour to summarise your evidence then, up to a particular stage you were sent to Europe to establish contacts to get to know the territory, so on and so forth, but you didn't yet know that one of your functions would be sanctions busting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Is that - in 1989 while you were establishing business contacts and so on and so forth in Europe, you didn't yet know that you would be asked to assist in sanctions busting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Mr Chairman, the sanctions busting, I wasn't given a specific task to go and do this or do this, in a general brief while I was overseas and I could make contact, I was supposed to do that, but I wasn't given a specific brief,  "Go to this armaments factory and procure arms".</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> I'm just trying to understand why in your evidence-in-chief and why when I was asking you questions to please explain the purpose of your presence in Europe, you made no mention whatsoever of the fact that you were eventually deployed to assist in the procurement of arms and that therefore that was one of the purposes of establishing yourself in Europe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I don't think we understand each other.  That wasn't the main reason that I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Your lawyer was asking you questions-in-chief right and you gave evidence about going to Germany and so on and so forth.  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You remember that?  You were then asked questions, where it seemed unclear to both myself and to the members of the Committee as to exactly what the purpose was of deploying you in Europe, remember those questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Throughout that evidence you at no stage said:  "Eventually it became apparent to me for what purpose I was being deployed or what one of the purposes was of my deployment in Europe, namely to assist in the procurement of arms."</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I take your point, but I don't think its - that wasn't an instruction of mine:  "Go to Germany and procure arms", that's why I didn't mention it in my evidence-in-chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But you subsequently, on your own evidence, you subsequently received an instruction to do just that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I said if during my trips in Germany I can get this, I should do it.  Nobody gave me instruction:  "Go and procure this particular arm."  If it came my way, I was supposed to try and do this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So if you happened to be travelling on the underground and you happened to overhear a conversation about somebody might want to sell arms, then you would just sort of take it up with them, if happened to come your way.  Is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, that's not my evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Well, you agree with me you have to do something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> But I didn't do anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But you've already agreed that you gave evidence to the effect that you travelled on a four month trip in an endeavour to broker deals for the acquisition of war materials.</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That was part of the four months trip.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> That's doing something, do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry.  Just to clear it up Mr Maree, you said you went in 1989 to establish yourself in Stuttgart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that you were going to get your family across and everything else and check out the schools, housing, etc, so why now are you talking about a four month trip to Germany?  Weren't you in Germany sort of like on a semi-permanent basis, having a home there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, not yet Sir.  I went on a trip first to establish contacts and check on the housing and schooling.  I returned and I went later again a second time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Kahanovitz.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Just to clarify.  The second time, did you in fact physically move to Germany?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You told us you were called back to South Africa and you were here at the time of the Harms Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> I assume then that you were subsequently told:  "Go back overseas".</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> By the way, as far as I understand you gave no evidence at the Harms Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> I assume they were endeavouring to trace your whereabouts to subpoena you to give evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, they weren't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> They weren't interested in you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I gave a statement to Mr McNally, but he didn't call me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  You also said in your evidence-in-chief that when you were establishing these businesses in, business contacts in Zambia, Botswana, Swaziland, Namibia, Lesotho, so on and so forth to give you freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes. Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> What would you do with your freedom of movement once you had it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That was part of the covert work. You must have freedom of movement so that you can move freely without being compromised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes, that I understand fully, but if your evidence was:  "I needed to be able to go to Lusaka, so that I could do this, that and the other", then I can understand your evidence.  You say:  "I need to establish a business in Lusaka, so that I can have freedom of movement in Zambia", but that's not your evidence.  Your evidence appears to be, you needed freedom of movement to go to these countries, but we don't understand what you were going to do once you could get there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I didn't know either, I hadn't received any instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  And what any of this has to do with operations in Natal, could you explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Sorry, I don't understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> This freedom of movement that you would have in Southern Africa, how would any of this relate to the fact that you were tasked to perform operations on behalf of the CCB in the province of Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Natal was given to me but I hadn't performed any operations there, but to make it that I could move to Natal without any suspicion or without questions being asked, that's why I opened a second company, so I could move to Natal and have freedom of movement in Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> I understand that.  That gets you as far as Durban, but now you want to travel from Durban to Lusaka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> If you can freely travel from Durban to Lusaka, how does that relate to your activities in Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I don't understand what you're asking me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Perhaps I could help you.  It's really quite simple.  You were to focus on KwaZulu Natal, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And in order to do that, your blue plan entailed starting Lema in Jo'burg, setting up Capall in Durban, then you had a linkage between Jo'burg and Durban, you could move between Jo'burg and Durban and then based in Durban, you could move around Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> However, working in KwaZulu Natal is one thing, working in Zambia and Namibia and Swaziland is a completely different thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> What is the relevance of working in Zambia and Namibia and those places in relation to working in KwaZulu Natal?  You see just to compare you to Mr van Zyl, for example, he was supposed to work in the Cape and he set up structures so that he could do that and he did, but he didn't work in Swaziland, he didn't work in Lesotho, he didn't work in Namibia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> He was based in the Cape and he moved between Jo'burg and the Cape and one would have thought that you would move between Jo'burg and KwaZulu Natal, but instead you end up in Germany and Namibia and all over the place and you don't do any work in KwaZulu Natal, so that's what's puzzling everybody here.  Do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well not everybody, but it's certainly puzzling me because your primary focus of your job was to work in KwaZulu Natal.  Your blue plan was supposed to be to facilitate that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> My blue plan, I did it so that I can have access in Natal. Because I had a company exporting to Africa, I had to move to - I had to go to these countries, not for any operations, to do my blue plan.  There was no other thing that was intended there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But you see, that's what also puzzles me.  If your job was to work in KwaZulu Natal, then Capall was sufficient to facilitate that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Why do you need a company that's trading with the rest of Africa, which doesn't have anything to do with being based in KwaZulu Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, no first of all, the first company, Lema, was a company that worked with the rest of Africa.  Natal didn't - Capall didn't work with the rest of Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Precisely, that's precisely the point, do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I'm sorry, I don't understand what your point is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see, we were led to understand, your evidence comes in the context of the evidence we've already heard and the evidence we've already heard is that people were regionalised and that you were given KwaZulu Natal to work with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The purpose of the blue plans was to provide cover in your areas of operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So why establish Lema which has got nothing to do with your area of operation, because it's between Jo'burg and the rest of Africa?  Just hear the rest of the question.  Rather than just establish Capall which provides a good base in Durban for you to work in the rest of KwaZulu Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Okay, Lema was established before I was given Natal.  That was in January of 1989, I think, so that was established first and then Capall was established after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So when were you given KwaZulu Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I'm not sure.  I'm not sure, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well then how do you know Lema was established?</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well, as soon as I got out, Lema was established first of all, myself for a blue plan and the reason why I opened up Capall was when I was given Natal, I had to move away from Jo'burg, that's why I opened a second company.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Kahanovitz.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Do I understand - let me rather ask you the question this way.  Did you recruit any unaware members in the province of Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Did you conduct any red plan activities on behalf of the CCB in the Province of Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So the long and the short of it is that your evidence is that you did nothing for the CCB in the province of Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I did not operations for the CCB, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Now the purpose of the blue plan was to provide a cover for your red plan activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> And the bottom line is you established the cover but you never used that cover in order to engage in offensive activities in the province of Natal, that's your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well the evidence, it hasn't been established, I was busy establishing it.  I was in the process of doing a good cover up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  And you don't find it at all strange that at no stage during that period Staal Burger came to you and said look, jobs A, B and C need to be carried out in Natal, please take the necessary steps?</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> That's not strange?</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> And on the other hand, Mr Burger is quite happy for you to be establishing blue plans in several other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But it seems that you were performing tasks in just about everywhere else in the world, except for Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well this might be so, I was establishing blue plans, which I was given instructions to do and I did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You appear to have been the CCB's first multi-national operative.  Now just to deal with your amnesty application, if we can go to page 20 of bundle A</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a>paragraph B at the top of the page of paragraph 8, it's the same question I put to various other of the operatives who used the same form, you say you were in Special Forces from 1988 through to 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But your evidence has in fact been that you left Special Forces in order to become part of the CCB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, it wasn't my evidence at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Well, what is your understanding?  Weren't you told that you must uncouple yourself from the SADF?</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I'm the wrong witness.  I'm a policeman, not the SADF.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> I'm not going to go through this.  I'll leave this for argument.  Now the date that you give on that page for the Evans incident, March 1989, now is that when you were instructed to establish his address?</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I can't remember off-hand but I'm taking it according to this ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> No, I'm not asking you according to, I'm asking why you put the date of March 1989 there, what the relevance is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I presume at that stage it was fresh in my mind.  I could recall that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That must have been the information that I gave the attorney too when he asked me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> I take it from your evidence that at that time the CCB didn't have a single unaware operative that was available to it in the whole of Johannesburg, because you said you couldn't find anybody whom you could send to try and establish Mr Evans' physical address.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I didn't have anyone.  I don't know about the other operatives there, I didn't have one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But why can't you just go and find yourself a criminal like Mr van Zyl and ask him to find out where Mr Evans lives?  I don't understand the problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> People worked differently.  That's not my method of working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, just on this.  You were a policeman for many years, Murder and Robbery, to establish the address of a person who is not on the run, who is unaware that somebody is trying to find his address, who goes to work to and from his home every day, got no reason to hide, what's the difficulty with that?  Couldn't you have just phoned up a friend or contact to say look, give me this guy's address, or just establish it yourself with ease, especially with your police background?</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I could do that but I would have to compromise myself by letting the people know where I was and get somebody from the police they would want to know what am I trying to do.  So the whole idea that I thought I was trying to do is not compromise myself and I did use a telephone and try, so nobody could trace it, do inquiries by telephone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you look in the phone book for his address?</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> He wasn't there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He wasn't there.  You looked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Kahanovitz.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> I thought Mr Lax had a question.  Alright page - by the way, what do you do for a living at the moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I'm a farmer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> What happened to these companies that were established?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I still have them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> How are they doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Page 23 of bundle A, you're asked to say on whose orders you carried out these tasks.  You mention the name of Staal Burger and you mention the name of Joe Verster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But you don't mention the name of Gen Webb, why is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I didn't receive orders from Gen Webb, I got them from, some from Joe Verster and some from Staal Burger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  Let's go to the body of your application.  Now I've read this application, well it's very short, I read it carefully, there's no mention in here of the fact that you were responsible for the province of Natal, do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Any particular reason why you left that out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Didn't do anything wrong in Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Because you did nothing there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  Nothing wrong there.  Were you ever asked to account to the Government or the State for the income of profits derived from businesses which were set up with CCB money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Would you care to make an estimate of the extent to which you have financially benefited?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> With the initial input from the Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Well let's take a yard stick, by the end of 1990, approximately a year, a year and a half, maybe two years, depending on which date which company was established, how much money did you manage to make from these various companies that you'd established?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I used the money from Lema to finance the other two companies and I didn't draw a salary, because I drew other people in without involving the Defence Force, the company paid for their salaries then and this was on the course which Mr Verster set out, this was the way it should actually operate so you don't draw money from the Government, the company must run itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  So at the end of 1990, how many companies did you have operating?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Three.  What approximately was the total turnover of those three companies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> In 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I'm going to have to guess here, I honestly don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Maybe R500 000.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  Now just returning then to your application at page 28, just read paragraph 3 to yourself, or maybe read it into the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> NO TRANSLATION</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a>" In my hoedanigheid as lid van die BSB was ek betrokke by sekere projekte.  Ek is geadviseer dat my betrokkenheid by een van die projekte, welke projek ek hierna beskryf, mag meebring dat ek my moontlik aan strafregtelike oortredings skuldig maak."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a>		"In case I do make myself guilty of such offences, I therefore according to the Act of Indemnity, apply for it."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Right.  Now it's clear from the way that this is phrased, that there's considerable doubt as to whether anything that you did in fact amounted to an offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> And the reason why it's phrased in that way becomes apparent when you read paragraph 4.  Just read paragraph 4 into the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a>MR MAREE</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a>"During approximately March 1989, I received an instruction to monitor Gavin Evans in order to determine whether or not he was involved in undermining activities towards the State.  I was aware that if I were to find evidence which would indicate that the aforementioned Evans was indeed involved in undermining activities towards the State, there could be possible action taken against him and that such action would be violent by nature and could possibly have his elimination as a consequence.  However I never received any instruction to take any steps against him with the objective of possible violence against Gavin Evans.  Before the opportunity arose for me to carry out my instruction to monitor Evans, I was given an instruction to go abroad and the project for Gavin Evans was taken away from me."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Now, why were you in doubt as to whether your conduct amounted to an offence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I was of the opinion that I hadn't done anything wrong, my legal advice was that I should have foreseen that even if it was a compartment of the crime, that it forms part of the crime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  so your thinking was that:  "If all I did was establish the guy's address, that can't be a crime"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Ja, but my legal advice was not that.  That was my thinking, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Good advice that you got.  Now, you've already agreed that the first sentence in that paragraph, that your instructions were to monitor him to establish him, sorry in order to establish whether he was involved in activities undermining the security of the State, that's false?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Now the next sentence is also false.  It must be so because the two are logically linked together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You agree with me, it's false?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Now, the final sentence of that paragraph</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a>"Before I could execute my order to monitor Gavin Evans, I was given an instruction to execute a project beyond the borders of South Africa and the Gavin Evans project was taken from me."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a>That's also false?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No it's not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But your evidence-in-chief has been, "I was tasked to establish his address.  I took a while to do it, but I did it."  Nothing to the effect of:  "I couldn't establish his address because I was sent overseas on another project."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I understand, sorry, I understand that.  Maybe the wording is not correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> No, no, it goes a lot further than that.  I'll tell you why you've inserted that sentence there in that way, because it's in line with the fact that the entire paragraph is a lie.  What you're telling the reader is the following.  You tell the reader that you were going to establish whether he was involved in activities undermining the security of the State.  That's the first thing you say.  The second thing you say is that you realise that after you'd carried out that monitoring activity, that information might have been used for purposes of his elimination.  Are you with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I'm with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But then you go on to tell the reader that you actually never got round to monitoring him because you went overseas which is why it can't be said that you've committed an offence.  In essence you say:  "I was asked to monitor him, but I never got, but I couldn't monitor him, even though I was asked to, because I was sent out of the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's what it says, yes.  I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Well, the whole thing is a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes.  I was just going to - it appears a lie but this was the legal people that drew up, it wasn't - as a previous witness also has said, we can say what we want to, but this comes from our legal people.  I'm not pushing the blame to anybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because usually if there's a distortion, it's to reduce the culpability of the writer.  Here it's just the opposite.  You know if you say:  "Look I had the task to establish the address, I did that, I didn't really know why they wanted the address except I believed that it was to take certain steps against Mr Evans of which I didn't know whether it was to break his window or kill him, I didn't know, but just to get his address", which is very, very straight forward, simple, it's against the law with that knowledge that steps might be taken against him, you might have been an accessory before the fact.  I don't know if it can be said that you were a conspirator, but in any even that would be for argument, but nothing too serious.  It's just difficult to comprehend, now this version then comes in, that you were there to monitor him which never happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, it didn't happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Kahanovitz.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see, sorry, your purpose wasn't even to monitor him, it was just to get his address.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> To establish an address, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Monitoring is something quite different.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  I'm just, I want to clarify.  You're now - Mr Basson's evidence, I just want to see if you agree with his evidence.  Mr Basson says that Staal Burger instructed you to use indirect members to trace Gavin Evans' whereabouts, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I don't think he told me directly, I would have done that myself, I can't remember Mr Burger giving me that instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Well somebody has to tell you to establish his address.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, that I can do, but telling me that I must do it with an indirect member, that I would do by myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Well, I'm just putting to you what Mr Basson's evidence was.  Mr Basson said you dragged your feet in doing this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That may be his perception, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Well, is it a correct perception?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well I dragged my feet in this particular thing, but the reason for that was that I was trying to run two or three businesses at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> How long do you think it would have taken you to - or, you knew that he worked at the Weekly Mail, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So his work address you could establish by looking it up in the phone book?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Home address?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That I did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes, but how much work was involved, you were involved in all these other things that you didn't have the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> We can sit and discuss it now, but at that time, the reality of the situation was that I was, it wasn't a major thing in my life to do this, to trace this address.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Mr Maree, how long did it in fact take you to get the address, from the time Mr Basson spoke to you until the time that you provided it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Two days, Sir.  Two days and three telephone calls.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Two days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Ja.  I didn't want to phone continuously ...(indistinct), so I give two days to redial again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I was under the impression that it was far longer than two days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Oh, no, no, sorry, how long it took me to actually trace?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, no, it took long since I was given the instruction, it took much longer than that, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What sort of period are you talking about, months or weeks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Months.  Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Did they bother you at all and say:  "Where's this guy's address?  What are you doing about it?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No they didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> They didn't bother?  Alright.  Now I just want to put - Mr van Zyl, I put to him your version to the effect that you were never involved in the framing of any plans to eliminate Gavin Evans.  That is your version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Mr van Zyl gave evidence to the effect that your version is untrue.  Mr van Zyl's understanding is that you were indeed involved in the framing of plans to eliminate Evans and that Evans was your project.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> This is not so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> If that's Mr van Zyl's version, is he not telling the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> He's not correct, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> I see.   I want to give you yet another version, that of Joe Verster's.  This appears, you don't need to go there but just for the purpose of the record, at page 190 of Bundle A, paragraph 1.1 he says the following</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a>"During 1989, members of the CCB were given an instruction to monitor one Gavin Evans in Johannesburg.  The persons who were involved in this were Staal Burger, Slang van Zyl, Calla Botha and Wouter Basson."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a>Now you'll note your name's not mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's my evidence, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So for a start Verster doesn't mention you, we've also received no evidence to the effect that Calla Botha was given instructions to monitor Gavin Evans.  Are you aware of any evidence which supports that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I'm not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> No, you're not.  Your alias, was that Stefan le Roux?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> I just want to refer you to the diary entry in Mr Basson's diary of the 9th of May 1989, where it refers to the priority targets of various people.  Next to your name it says Evans and the figure 2 appears, the number 2.  Maybe I must just show you the page.  Maybe if your lawyer can just show you the diary entry for the 9th of May.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just to make it clear, the 2 is not in relation to your name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I see the 2, my one the 2 is next to Deon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Sorry, the question was not properly put.  Next to your name only the name Evans appears.  Now ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Sorry, could we just get a date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 9 May.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Okay, I see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Now van Zyl's evidence has been that Evans was your project and by that he meant that you originally were tasked to eliminate Gavin Evans.  Now it could also be argued that this diary entry in fact supports that evidence because we know that Mr van Zyl was tasked to eliminate Dullah Omar, we know that Calla Botha was working on Bruce White, we know that Staal Burger was working on "von Finkelstein".  Why are you, according to this diary entry, then tasked with Evans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I can't answer, that's not my diary.  I can speculate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> The name was given to me by Basson who wrote the diary and he didn't show me documentation to trace Evans.  Maybe you should ask Basson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But you see this is in May.  You've told us that to the best of your recollection, the steps you took to establish his address were in March, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That it took some months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So you're telling us that it may well be that you still hadn't established his address in May?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It's possible Sir, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> And your speculation is that that would be the only reason why your name would be linked to Evans in May.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's not the only reason, it could be one of the reasons, I'm speculating.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> What other reasons could there be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I don't know, I'm speculating.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  Then return to Bundle A, page 30.  We've already agreed that the general nature of the evidence contained in paragraph 4 is false, but this statement that you were sent, the top of page 30</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a>"because you were sent out of the country on a project, Gavin Evans was taken away from you."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a>Were you in fact sent out of the country at that stage on a project?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> What project are you referring to there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> If I can recall correctly, I'm thinking off the top of my head now, it was to Greece.  It wasn't a project, it was setting up, doing a business deal with a businessman in Greece.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> What kind of business deal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> We were trying to buy a rent-a-car business on the Island of Rode.  This was not funded by the CCB, it was part of my blue plan, part of Lema's thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Was this an independent business initiative of your own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> In fact it had nothing to do with the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The use of the word project is then clearly incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It's incorrect.  I considered it as a project because of my blue plan, but it wasn't a project as in an operational project, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But you surely wouldn't have been given an order then either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So that's also not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Right.  Paragraph 5, just read that into the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a>MR MAREE</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a>"I only heard later that one Abram Slang testified before the TRC that there were plans to eliminate Mr Gavin Evans.  However, I was not involved at all in the formulation of such plans or made any attempt to execute such plans."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> I'm just going to put it to you, that paragraph's also false because at the time you drafted this statement, you were aware that plans were implemented for his elimination, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You were also aware that the reason why you were asked to establish his address, was part of the planning phase of that conspiracy to eliminate Mr Evans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I disagree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You're sent off by the CCB to find out where the man lives, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You find out afterwards that a plan was implemented to eliminate him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You put 2 and 2 together, what does it tell you?  Why was I sent to establish the man's address?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I'm ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Because they wanted to kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I'm missing the point here.  This was - when the statement was made I was aware then, but not at the time when I was tasked to get his address.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> I'm putting it to you on the basis that you drafted, you signed this statement at the time that you were aware, even on your own version, that a plan had been implemented to eliminate Mr Evans, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> At the time you ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So you ask yourself, you're aware even at that time, you've already admitted this in your evidence,  "They sent me to find his address.  I knew that the reason that they were doing that was because they intended to take steps against him."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I understand, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Subsequently you find out what the nature of those steps was, they wanted to kill the man.  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So you say to yourself, why did they send me to find out his address?  Because they wanted to use that information as part of a plan to kill him.  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So therefore to say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a>"I was not at all involved in the formulation of such plans, nor was I involved in any attempt to execute such plans"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a>is wrong, because you were involved in the preparatory stages of the implementation of that plan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> If we look at it the other way, that's why  I'm applying for this.  That's why I'm applying for amnesty in the first place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Why were you doing work in the Transvaal on Mr Evans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Well, we don't know either.  We're told that Mr Botha was given the Transvaal and we're told that you were given Natal.  But we're now told that you were the guy who was checking up on Evans in Transvaal.  Could you explain that to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I can't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You've got no idea?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Well we don't either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman, but there was also evidence that although specific problems were allotted, that it didn't  mean that the operative couldn't operate anywhere else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, no we're aware, but I think the question was fair, if he knew why he was given that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But it also appears at this stage of the game that you could operate anywhere in the world, so maybe ...  Now Mr van Zyl says in his evidence that an in-house was held in March 1989 regarding Gavin Evans and he says that you were in fact present at that in-house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But Mr Chairman, he also, questioned by myself, conceded that he may be incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> I just want - I'm putting Mr van Zyl's original evidence to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But what do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, it's not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> In fact Mr van Zyl not only testified that you were at that in-house, Mr van Zyl says that you relayed, let me put this question in context.  Mr van Zyl was being asked:  "Why do you say that Evans was Maree's project?" and one of the reasons he gave, was he says that you relayed certain information to him about this project.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, that's not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So, just for purposes of the record that's at page 1374, of the typed record.  Do I take it then that your evidence is that in fact you never even discussed the Evans project with van Zyl?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You had no reason to ever have a discussion with van Zyl about the Evans' project?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you, as a member of the CCB, after attending that initial course, ever have occasion to have contact  with your colleagues, Mr van Zyl, Mr Botha and others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I did, we had weekly meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You had weekly meetings. Sort of scheduled, every week you had a meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Even if there wasn't anything really specific to discuss?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Now ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, just while we're here.  These weekly meetings, how did they work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> We would arrange, each one would get a turn to book an hotel room and we'd meet at that particular hotel room and that's how we'd meet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, but what would happen?  Would you all be present together in the same room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> We were initially present together.  If there was work to be done, each one would come in separately to speak to the Co-ordinator and Mr Burger, so I wouldn't be present if van Zyl was meeting them or if Botha was meeting then and so too, they wouldn't be present when I was meeting them, but we would be there to do our administration and car logs and finances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And would you have general meetings where all of you were present and general matters were discussed applicable to all of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.  I think so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What sort of issues would be discussed there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Maybe medical - I'm just trying to think off-hand now, medical bills and more administrative kind of stuff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> ;   You never discussed policy together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So you all understood the guidelines better?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I think informally we did that, yes, but not at a formal meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Were you told to concentrate on Trade Unions in Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Who told you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Mr Burger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Mr Burger.  What was going to be the purpose of those activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I don't know, it was in the initial stage, he gave me advice,  "If you're working in an hotel, see if you can get into Trade Unions and into the Motel Indian Congress", that was my ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> In the sense that that was the enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Right.  And did you ever do anything about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Did you have difficulty adjusting to your new job in the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I had difficulty in adjusting, not in the CCB, I had difficulty in adjusting to my blue plan, getting these businesses going.  I didn't envisage that it would run away with me.  I battled to keep up with the business world because it wasn't my forte at all.  That's why I went on courses, to try and keep up, it grew too quickly so I couldn't, I was in a catch 22 position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You see, if someone in the CCB had to say the following, I just want you to comment, if they were asked:  "Why did you appear to do so little in Natal?" and the answer they gave was:  "Well, you had difficulty adjusting to the working methods of the CCB", what would your comment be?  In fact you had, let me phrase it a bit stronger, you had a lot of problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Ja, I did have a lot of problems trying to run two companies with no experience, I had major problems there, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> In other words you're telling us you were so focused on your business that you didn't really have the time to get involved in the Natal Indian Congress and the Trade Unions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well, the business to me, as I said, initially it didn't go about the money, it was important to me to establish it because without that I couldn't function.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes, I understand your evidence, you say you can't separate the two issues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You had to establish your business first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's what I tried to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> That's what you saw as your priority.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I just say this though, or ask this if I may?  Those sorts of issues about dealing with business and being inexperienced and basically being stretched to the limit, that's got nothing to do with not being able to adapt to the military style of management.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, the military, I had no problem with the military, I was in the police for 23 years, so I have no problem with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well you see the focus of the comment that Mr Kahanovitz put to you was put in that context.  You were a policeman and you weren't used to the military way and that was why you had trouble fitting in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well my opinion is not that, maybe the military would have a different opinion to that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Just for sake of completeness, the source of that evidence was Wouter Basson, that's at page 2264 of the record.  He says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a>"I think he had a lot of problems to adjust to the new methods and modus operandi."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a>Now evidence has been produced that there was an interest in Jay Naidoo.  Were you ever asked to look into Jay Naidoo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I wasn't, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Evidence was produced at the Harms Commission and the Harms Commission found that there was a CCB plan to kill an attorney in Durban, Mr Mhlaba and that plan was to be implemented on the 13th of March 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I never heard of him before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Never heard of him.  Alright.  Now as regards the Omar project, were you at any stage during 1989 aware that there was such a project?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I'm just trying to think, no, not in 1989 no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So you never attended a single cell meeting where it was mentioned that there was such a project?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> And in fact the first time you ever heard of the Omar project, was when it was divulged at the Harms Commission, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So you guys never chatted amongst yourselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I didn't.  Maybe that's what Basson meant, that I wasn't, coming from a police barrack, you're inclined to work alone and in the military you work maybe in a bigger group.  I believe - with any of my operations I tried to cut off and do it professionally.  Nobody must know what I'm doing and I expected the same from them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes, but there's already been evidence that cell meetings were held at various hotels, you would arrive there, somebody would be making a presentation or somebody would be about to make a presentation, so you would overhear things that weren't necessarily your project.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I never overheard anything about ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You never heard anything, alright.  And I ask you the same question in relation to the Early Learning Centre project.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Also not, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Project Apie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Now, is it so, would it be correct to say that you mainly worked outside of the Republic of South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> And would it be correct to say that that work was being done on behalf of Region 6?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Now, I want to deal with your involvement in the Namibian elections.  Now evidence has already been produced that the CCB was going to focus its attentions on Namibia in the pre-election phase.  Did you attend the meeting where various projects related to Namibia were discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I can't remember it off-hand but I know that there were instructions that Namibia was a priority, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Priority.  Were you aware of the fact that production bonuses were promised to people for successful projects completed in Namibia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I can't remember specifically who said, but I can recall hearing a conversation to that effect, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> That there would be financial rewards for a job well done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Do you have any recollections to what sort of figures were mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Now, we know that you were Aitchison's handler.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> What is your understanding of what the word handler means?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> A handler is a person who guides somebody else in covert work, you look after this person's interests.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> What did you, when you introduced yourself to Donald Aitchison, what did you tell him you did for a living?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I told him I was from the Security Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> That sounds like a fantastic cover.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I didn't need a cover because I already received a CV, he was - I was handed him from somewhere else and on his CV he was ex-Rhodesian and he was this big operator, so ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Can I just clarify, in fact he was an Irish citizen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But he fought on behalf of the Rhodesians.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> In Rhodesia, that's correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> And he styled himself as, amongst other things, a mercenary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But you - are you saying you didn't need to create a cover for Aitchison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I didn't need to create a cover because my instruction with him was to put him as a sleeper, so I can't go and tell him I'm a businessman and you must then go and be a sleeper, it just doesn't work like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So what did you tell him?  You said:  "I'm from the Security Police and I want you" to do what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> We need - first of all I just questioned him a bit when we spoke to see if he knows about Intelligence work and he obviously had ...(indistinct) background, he knew what a speaker was and I explained to him that that's what I wanted him to do.  He must settle himself in for 5 years, because at that stage the election was just about to come on, so that we could reactivate him after the election, three, five years time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But I understand your evidence to be that you didn't know how he came to be recruited.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Who put you in contact with Aitchison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Mr Burger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> He told you to go and meet this guy in a hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Ja, he gave me the telephone number of Mr Aitchison and his CV yes and told me I must go and meet this guy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Ja, he gave me a telephone number of Mr Aitchison and his CV, yes and told me to go and meet this guy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> How did Mr Burger get introduced to Mr Aitchison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I don't know.  I don't know if he was introduced to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So he just says:  "Phone this guy at the hotel, he may be of use to us.  You go talk to him"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> What does he say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> He said:  "Phone this guy", he gave me Mr Aitchison's CV "and place him in Namibia."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> And you don't ask any questions as to where this CV comes from or anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, well a CV was given to me, I don't ask him for that.  There were obviously questions in regard to Namibia, what he must do.  He must be a sleeper, that was instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You see what I don't understand in your evidence-in-chief you said that it came as a great surprise to you after Aitchison was arrested, to discover that Aitchison before meeting you had met Ferdi Barnard and had met Calla Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But how is it possible, forget about you for the moment, as I understand the chain of events was that Calla Botha told Staal Burger about Aitchison's existence, that's how Staal Burger came to know about Aitchison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> And he must have told him that he'd met the guy, so how could it be a surprise to the CCB that Aitchison knew Calla Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He didn't say it was a surprise to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> It was a surprise to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Except it goes, well  maybe we can canvass this issue with Mr Botha when he gives his evidence.  He deals with it in his statement.  But if I understand, your evidence is that if you'd known that Aitchison knew who he was really working for at the time that you'd recruited him, because he'd spoken to Mr Barnard and Mr Burger, you wouldn't have used him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Definitely not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Just to clarify for the record, why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Because I would have been compromised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So he played along and when you came and told him you were from the Security Police and so on and so forth, he just played along.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Now after Aitchison was released from detention in Namibia, he made a statement to the South African Police.  I just want to put certain allegations contained in that statement to you, just for purpose of the record, that statement, I don't have a copy of the statement anymore, it was handed up as an exhibit at the inquest into the assassination of Anton Lubowski, but I still have our heads of argument from that matter where we deal with the contents of that statement.  Statement dated 14 January 1991 and it was taken by Lieut Col Eager of the Brixton Murder and Robbery Squad.  Now Aitchison says that you contacted him, he obviously knew who you were by the time the statement was taken, and arranged to meet him at the Ascot Hotel in Norwood Johannesburg.  This is the first time they met, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> He said you asked him if he was willing to go to Namibia and you told him to go there and hire a house, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> He says at that stage you didn't tell him what he would be required to do, once he got there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> He says you didn't tell him what he would be required to do once he got there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Ja, I think - he was a sleeper, that's what he was supposed to be doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes, but what was he going to do when he woke up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I'll use different terminology so you can understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes, I understand the concept of a sleeper, but what - you obviously both had a common understanding that he was going to be utilised for a particular purpose after he had established himself.  What was that purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> There was no purpose explained to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  You gave him your pager number to contact him in the future.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> He says in August 1989 he had meetings with you in Swaziland and Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I met him on a few occasions in Swaziland, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> By the way, part of those meetings in Swaziland were to give him money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> What was he going to use the money for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> His sustenance, to live.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Why were you meeting him in Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I timed that with my company things for Lema, so have a cover to be at a particular place at the right time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Why didn't you just deposit money into his bank account in Windhoek?  Why do you have to go and meet in Swaziland just to give him money, that's what I don't understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I'm not sure what the particular thing, he had some problem and I made a plan to be in Swaziland to give him that money at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> What was his problem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I don't know.  I can't remember particularly what the problem was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We don't really need all these fine details Mr Kahanovitz.  I'm not wanting to stop you, but just to remind you, we're not going to make any findings on the dealings between this witness and Aitchison, we're not briefed for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Aitchison says that you gave him explosive devices which were to be used to sabotage SWAPO vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You deny that?  I thought you might.    He says that you told him to give these to a man by code name Taxi who would place them</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Never heard of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  He says you told him to take photographs of the house of Gwen Lister, the editor of the Namibian, establish what car she drove and take notice of who her contacts were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You deny that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Absolutely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> He says that at this meeting where he received his instructions, you were in possession of a photograph of Anton Lubowski.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> He says that you gave him the registration number of Lubowski's car and you told him to keep a look out for it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, that's not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> He says he met with you on the 10th of September 1989 at the Kalahari Sands Hotel in Windhoek where you gave him an instruction to attempt to use poison to murder Gwen Lister.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You deny that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Absolutely.  The meetings in Namibia were at the Sands Hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> He said at a subsequent meeting he discussed with you the difficulties that he was encountering in executing the plan to poison Gwen Lister.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, his problems were with housing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> He said that he returned to the cottage that he'd hired on a particular day thereafter and he found a parcel that had been left there for him, containing an AK47 and two magazines, this was on the 11th of September, 1989, the day before Adv Lubowski's assassination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I can't comment about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> He says that you phoned him and told him to take this "parcel" to the Kalahari Sands Hotel between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening on the following day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> He says, he denies, Aitchison denies involvement in shooting Lubowski, what he does say is that after Lubowski was shot, he phoned you, you told him that he should go to Lusaka for a few days and that you would meet him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> This is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Now the meeting that was held in Johannesburg, that's referred to in Mr Botha's statement, were you here yesterday when we dealt with the instruction being sent to destroy the guest register at the Norwood Hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Were you at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You confirm that an instruction to steal that hotel register was given at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Do you confirm that you were instructed to go into hiding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> That's incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I was - there was no plan at that stage.  When Botha took the register, I wasn't given instruction then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> At what stage are you - at this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes.  Mr Basson said ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Not at that meeting, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Well whether it - were you at any stage in or about, or let me rephrase the question.  Were you at some stage shortly after Lubowski's assassination instructed to go into hiding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> In December and January 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> No, that wasn't Mr Basson's evidence.  Mr Basson, or both Mr Basson and Mr Botha agree that at this meeting, or let me read you what is said about what happened at this meeting.  He says that there was this emergency meeting.  Sorry I got the name of the hotel wrong, it was at the Indaba Hotel or the Rosebank Hotel and that everybody was worried about Aitchison's detention and he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a>"Particularly Maree and Burger."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Were you particularly worried?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Why were you particularly worried?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Because I'm directly attached to this guy, I'm handling him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So you thought maybe this guy killed Lubowski.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well, he was arrested, it was a problem for me, absolutely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But why might he have killed Lubowski?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I didn't say he killed, I don't know, but I'm connected directly to this guy who had been arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  Now, but it struck you as conceivable that Aitchison merely off his own bat had decided to assassinate Lubowski, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I don't think off his own bat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Who might have asked him to do it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I'll be speculating.  At that stage in Namibia, everybody was running around in Namibia, not just the CCB and Military Intelligence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But what Mr Kahanovitz is asking you, did you perceive that it was possible that he might have been the person who ...(indistinct - speaking simultaneously)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That he might have been used, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Because he was the kind of person who you were aware, if you offered him enough money, certainly he'd said to you:  "If you pay me, I will kill someone".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, he didn't say that to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But we've already had evidence that he held - Mr Burger has already admitted that Aitchison held himself out as a hit man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, but he didn't tell me that.  He didn't tell me:  "Give me money, I'll kill somebody."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> What does it mean to say if someone holds himself as a hit man?  He's saying to you:  "If you pay me enough money, I'll kill someone for you."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That's the evidence of Mr Burger.  I can't judge by Mr Burger, that's what Mr Burger understood by it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> What did you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I understood Aitchison to be an ex-mercenary, or ex-Zimbabwean operator and at one stage I told Mr Verster and Mr Basson:  "I'm concerned about him because he's playing James Bond.  The CIA is following him, the KGB is following him around.  I'm trying to calm him down."  So I was concerned that he's playing games, he's playing spy-spy and I reported that to...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> What quality did he have that led you to utilise him in Namibia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> He didn't have qualities that I would use.  He was put on me to place there, so I didn't recruit this guy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You see the only quality is, and I use that word advisedly, that I'm aware that Aitchison purported to have, was an ability to kill people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I understand what you're saying.  I'm saying, I didn't go and recruit him, so I wouldn't have - he's not the guy I would have put in Namibia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Now, just to return to that meeting.  What Mr Botha says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a>"It was then recommended"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a>at the same meeting,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a>"that Maree should leave and that he should lie low."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I think Mr Botha's timing is wrong there.  This only came in in December of 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But Mr Botha's evidence makes sense and this is in fact confirmed by Mr Basson yesterday.  If you're worried about being linked to Aitchison and Aitchison has been arrested and you wish to avoid arrest and detention, it makes sense for you to go and lie low.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> The facts prove that I didn't lie low at that stage.  I mean if it makes sense or not, I didn't, I only went in December of 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> I'm open to correction, but I have a fairly clear recollection of the evidence yesterday from Mr Basson, was that you did in fact go and lie low.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I went overseas in December of 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So the bottom line is, if anybody says that subsequent to that meeting, you went to lie low because you were worried about being arrested or detained, arising out of the assassination of Adv Lubowski, that evidence is untrue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I missed the gist of your things, give them again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> If anybody says that after this emergency meeting you went to lie low because you were worried that you might be arrested or detained on suspicion of involvement in Adv Lubowski's murder, they're not telling the truth.  Is that your version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, that meeting, at that meeting it didn't transpire.  I didn't go and lie low after that meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Did you ever go and lie low because you were worried that you might be arrested for Adv Lubowski's assassination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, that's what I explained to you, in December 1990, that's what we're arguing about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> 1989, sorry, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Your version is after, I forget who, the first person who was arrested, was it Mr Botha or Mr Barnard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I'm not sure which was arrested first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You gave evidence-in-chief - was it Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Barnard first and then Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Mr Barnard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> You said at the time that those people got arrested, you left the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, I left the country in December 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  And one of the reasons that you left, the CCB was about to be exposed, that was the concern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Okay.  And in addition you were worried that you might be arrested for the Lubowski assassination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Because you were aware that Jumbo Smit from the Namibian police was doing investigations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Mr Chairman, if I can just have five more minutes, I'd rather then just finish before lunch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you, that would probably be the most convenient thing to do Mr Kahanovitz.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Were you aware of a plot to assassinate ...(indistinct) Hamutenya in Namibia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> No you weren't.  Daniel Tjongarero from SWAPO?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Nico Bessinger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So you were visiting Windhoek on a regular basis, purely to speak to, to handle Aitchison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> To handle Aitchison yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> And I assume, run your business.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> And the business, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So this whole SWAPO campaign directed, excuse me CCB campaign, directed against the Namibian elections, you played no role whatsoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I think I played a role.  I think the reason why Aitchison was given me in retrospect is because I had established a company there and that would slot in there.  It would give me movement to go and handle him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But I think what Mr Kahanovitz is asking, besides setting up your blue plan there and establishing Aitchison, he's asking you, did you play any role at all in the CCB operations relating or concerning the Namibian elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> So, do I take it then that all these projects to doctor oil, poison water holes, burn vehicles, kill people, you had no involvement whatsoever in any of those projects?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I had no knowledge of them at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> If I might just have a minute?  You said in your evidence-in-chief that somebody contacted you while you were in Germany and told you to not come back because all hell's broken loose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Ja, Mr Verster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Is it Mr Verster?  What did he tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> He told me that I was to remain in Germany and I would be contacted and told when I should return.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> But why did he not want you to return?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well that was the period that I was lying low for Namibia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> In other words, words to the effect of:  "The Namibian police are looking for you, don't come back to South Africa, you could be arrested."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Alright.  Where is Donald Aitchison today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> No further questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KAHANOVITZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Well let's see how long it will be.  Do you have any questions Mr Hockey?  Sorry Mr Rheeder do you have any questions?  Ms Coleridge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> I do, Chairperson, just a few.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Should we handle it now before the lunch adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> It won't take very long, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I think let's finish this witness then we can start ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS COLERIDGE:</span> Mr Maree, what were you other codenames besides Le Roux?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I just had one, Stefan Le Roux.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> And you said you had a partner that dealt</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a>with you in your business, 89, 90.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> What was your partner's name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Mr Ehlers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> Mr Ehlers.  And you said that once you, after Calla Botha and van Zyl were arrested, you informed your partner about the dealings.  What did you inform him about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I explained to him that the company that I set up and I brought him into was a front company and that he would be much more active in the company, he would take over the company and he did that then and to inform the staff too what the - because it was going to be in the newspapers anyway.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> And so he knew that this company was a front company of the CCB and he knew that this involved certain illegal activities, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> He knew that, after I told him in 1990, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> And is he still your partner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, he is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> And then just in relation to your operations, was your operation called, by the CCB, was it called Lema?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> My project name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> Your project name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I can't even remember what, it wasn't called Lema, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> And what was the other operation, Toddler, which was your operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> That was the project name for my blue plan, yes, Toddler.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> So it was just in relation to your blue plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> And then just in relation to the DCC, we know that lots of CCB members, about 30 odd of them, worked for the DCC after 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> And you were one of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I was one of them, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> Your companies that you had at the time, was that also used as front companies for DCC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, that was finished then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> But you still have these companies today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I still have these companies going at the moment, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> So who operated those companies at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> My partner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> And why did you leave the DCC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> We were - after the Goldstone, Judge Goldstone raided the offices and all the CCB people were paid off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> Was it because you were involved in illegal activities besides intelligence work, because wasn't the DCC ..(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No because I was ...(indistinct) and for DCC I was working in overseas countries as well, I wasn't working internally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> So you're saying, were you dismissed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> For doing nothing, basically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS COLERIDGE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you have any re-examination Mr du Plessis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> No thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR P DU PLESSIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Lax, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks Chair, I've just got two.  You said that at one point, this was if you'd realised what the implications of</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a>your order to go to Namibia might have been, in retrospect you might have acted differently.  That was your evidence.  What did you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> In regard to the person I placed there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes.  I'm not sure what you meant, that's what I'm trying to understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I understood the question to be if I had to recruit somebody, why would I recruit somebody like Aitchison and in retrospect, I didn't recruit him, so I had no option, I took him for what he was.  If I had to recruit, think of somebody to put as a sleeper, I would not choose him, I'd have chosen somebody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You also said that at the time you were worried about him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What did you do about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I reported it to Mr Verster and Mr Basson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did you not recommend that he be removed from there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Well, I explained to them and they said I should leave him there.  As I say, he had a phobia about being a spy and everybody is following him around and the KGB and CIA and he was taking photographs of people following him around and I was concerned about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1545"><a name="pos1545"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> It seems, you've read Aitchison's CV.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And you would have had no doubt after reading that what kind of person he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And yet you continued to handle him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes, that's what I was trying to explain to you that if I had to recruit somebody, I would not have chosen him, I would have chosen somebody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now besides visiting him from time to time, or speaking to him on the phone, how did you actually handle him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I handled him as you say by phone and speaking to him.  Nothing had been ...(indistinct) I was only just supposed to settle him in and this is what I was trying to do, by trying to get him accommodation, trying to get his house, trying to get his kids there and trying to get his furniture and his wife there.  That was my initial ...(indistinct) to try and get him settled there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The impression I certainly get about him was that he was playing a double game with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I agree with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You didn't pick that up at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, I didn't think that he was playing a double game, but I thought he was playing James Bond, I wasn't aware that he was doing something else, but as I said, I was concerned and I did bring it up with the people, I'm not happy with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Because if half the things he says in his statement are even vaguely true, he was quite busy in Namibia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Apparently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And yet you didn't pick that up as his handler at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibanyoni, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Just one, Mr Chairperson.  Your partner, you said he accompanied you overseas and the cost was paid by the Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Was your partner not aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No.  No at that stage he was a minor partner and he was under the impression that I was putting the money in personally, he wasn't aware that the Defence Force was putting this money into the company, so I paid for his ticket, but in reality the Defence Force was paying for his ticket.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> He didn't know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> No, he didn't know that, no not at all, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, just one last thing.  Your other business, Capall, did you notify that partner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I notified him as well and I gave him the company when I withdrew because I was too far away from Durban to run it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1572"><a name="pos1572"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> .  So do you still have interests in those companies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1573"><a name="pos1573"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> I have interests in Lema yes.  Not in Capall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1574"><a name="pos1574"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Are there any questions arising?  No questions arising.  Mr Maree that then concludes your evidence, you may stand down now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1575"><a name="pos1575"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAREE:</span> Thank you Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1576"><a name="pos1576"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line1577"><a name="pos1577"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  We'll now take the lunch adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  Mr Coetzee, I take it, is Mr Barnard going to be the next applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, Mr Barnard is ready to testify.  He will testify in Afrikaans.  He can be questioned in English, but will answer in Afrikaans.</p>
