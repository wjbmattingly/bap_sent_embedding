An employee of the Cape Town \nCity Council, John Jacobs, was on duty that Thursday evening of the \n30th of December 1993.  He was patrolling the streets to see \nwhether all the street lights were burning.  He and a colleague were \ndriving alone Lower Main Road in Observatory from north to south. \n As they arrived at the corner of Lower Main Road and Station \nRoad, they heard sounds like gun fire or fire crackers and saw three \nmen emerge.  Since they wanted to turn into Station Road, they saw \nthree men in a car, against the one way, in Station Road, driving in \ntheir direction.  They were then forced to wait for this motor \nvehicle.  Mr Jacobs heard gun shots at the very moment when \nsomeone emerged from the door of the facility on the corner of \nStation Road and Lower Main Road.  He saw the end of a rifle \nsticking slightly out of the back passenger window of the vehicle.  It \nwas clear to him that someone was firing from the motor vehicle at \nthis person.  He had fallen flat in his motor vehicle and then when he \nlifted his head again, he saw the person who had emerged from the \ndoor of the corner facility lying in the storm water drain in Station \nRoad.\n\tNow, that version doesn't exactly correspond with what you \nobserved, do you agree with that?",

And I will just read to you again what he \nsays.\n\tI am reading from paragraph three, the sub-heading \"the \nincident\".  I had been on duty at Machados restaurant on the night \nof 30 December 1993, when the incident in question took place.  \nThe restaurant had been quite full that evening, being the festive \nseason and everyone was in a jolly mood.\n\tAfter the restaurant had closed, the owner Joe Cerqueira, his \nbrother and another colleague whose name I can't remember, had \nbeen clearing the restaurant and set about preparing the restaurant \nfor the next day's business when we heard what we assumed was a \ncar backfiring in the road outside.   This sound continued and we \nthought it may also be the sound of fireworks thrown by some \npartygoers outside.\n\tI was the first to walk out of the restaurant to investigate and \nwas followed by my colleagues.  I saw individuals coming out of the \nHeidelberg Tavern, which is located next to Machados restaurant.  \nThey were making their way to a dark coloured car.  I saw what I \nagain thought was flares or fireworks and then noticed these \nindividuals were firing automatic machine gun fire in all directions.\n\tOnce they spotted me and my colleagues, they fired in our \ndirection.  In the resulting confusion, we pushed our way back into \nthe restaurant and took cover as best we could.  I remember lying \nflat on the floor of the restaurant.  \n\tOn page 74 at the top - once the firing had stopped, I ran out \nof the restaurant, it was at this stage that I saw the deceased, Joe \nCerqueira lying, dying in the gutter.  He had been shot in the chest.  \nThe result was complete mayhem as people ran around in shock, \nshouting for help.  It was only at this stage, when I knelt down next \nto the deceased, that I realised that I had been shot in the leg. \n\tMy thoughts at that stage were about Joe Cerqueira and I \nremember thinking Joe, you can't die now.  The exact details of what \nhappened after that, are not clear to me.\n\tSo, in that statement too, he doesn't mention you specifically, \nalthough he may have meant when he said once they, that is now the \n...

The eldest daughter of \nAndrea Langford, sister to three sisters and a brother, loved \nby her family, friends and all who were privileged to know \nher.\n\tOn the 9th of December 1993, she had received her higher \ndiploma in Education post graduate for secondary education.  \nShe completed the prescribed course in the following teaching \nsubjects  Art, school counselling and guidance.  She could \nalso teach through the medium of Afrikaans higher and \nEnglish higher.\n\tSince the very young age of seven, she was capable of \nattaining the goals she reached for, such as ballet with \nhonours and scripture exams with distinction.  Besides her \nschool studies, which later included drama, this pattern was \npursued while at University.  Her first three years were at \nRhodes University where she received her BA degree in fine \nart and psychology.\n\tAnd at the same time, she was a keen sportswoman.  That was \nin volley ball.  She also completed an advance course in \ndeportment, beauty rooting, fashion and photographic \nmodelling.

Though the last memory of her causes us \nto sorrow, not as the world, but with the hope of everlasting \nlife.  I know if she was here, she would want us to hold onto \nthe truth.\n\tThe loss to the family came at a time when funds were \nexhausted.  I, her mother, had to come up to Cape Town and \nidentify her and do the necessary arrangements for her burial \nin Port Elizabeth.  This was very difficult at the time as I was \nunemployed, due to the fact that I had given up my work the \nprevious year, to sort out our family matters after her father's \nsudden death due to respiratory failure.\n\tHis small business had to be shut down and I had not \nrecovered from these losses, when this tragedy struck the \nfamily.  Family and friends rallied around at the time, I thank \nGod for them.  I was told that a fund had been established to \nassist the families, but this came to nought - up to this very \nhour, I have never been assisted in any way.\n\tI feel I have the right to ask what is the right of human life, is \nit not to be given a free chance to live?  This is what I would \nsay if I were given the opportunity to make the statement.\n\tThe past four years have been exceptionally difficult since \nBernadette's death.  As a result, we had to deal with many \nfrustrations such as continually being asked about our feelings \nand our view concerning the way in which she died because \nthe community where I live, could not accept the way in which \nshe died.\n\tMy relatives all suffered emotionally because of the trauma \nand they knew that because of our culture in which we care \nfor the one who cares for you, this was not going to happen.  \nI asked God for inner strength and the courage to forgive \nwhich I did.\n\tI had to remember to lead by example, which the rest of the \nfamily would follow.  The hardships have not ended because \nlife has become more expensive.  I have a casual job since last \nyear, which is a blessing in a small way.\n\tThe men who shot Bernadette, have to understand that we \nforgave them as a family, but this shouldn't prevent justice \nfrom taking place.  I wish to say to the Truth and \nReconciliation Commission and all who are assembled here for \nthe Heidelberg Tavern hearing, man can do what is humanly \npossible, but God can do the impossible to reconcile man to \nGod.  To the ones who sent you, you planted the seed and \nwatered it, you saw it grow, so you are very much part of the \nend result, but I tell you too, there is a way to find peace of \nmind - may God grant you the wisdom to understand.",

I have forgiven them so I \nwill explain that line.\n\tI will just go on from here.

If they can be brought here or at a \nseparate hearing, we will be satisfied as I said.\n\tAnd as I will say to the applicants, as I heard all the time, \nthey acted under orders which I understand.  I too, act under orders \nas I sit here now, just speaking directly to you because I firmly \nwould like to believe that we all do believe there is a God above our \nheads.\n\tIf I can be allowed to say this, and because I believe that God \nis God and I act under His orders and for me, His orders are to say \nto you and to all here, yes, I have forgiven you.  I will not oppose \nyour amnesty because who am I, I am not your judge.  I can never \njudge you, but there is a way to find the freedom more than amnesty \ncan free you from. And that is if you give your hearts to Him.  And \nyou truly believe that He did send his Son for all of us here present, \nnot only for a sinner, but for all and you give your hearts to Him, \nyou will find the peace that I have found, with which I can say to \nyou I have forgiven you and I will not oppose your amnesty.

Nothing has changed, I still feel \nexactly the same way and I do forgive you because my High \nCommand, demonstrated to me how to do that by forgiving his \nkillers.\n\tI want to tell you who Lindi was.  She was known as Lindiwe \nby her Xhosa friends.  Lindi was a true child of Africa.  She was \nhappiest hiking in the mountains, riding a horse with her dog out in \nthe countryside.  She was just finishing a Bachelor of Science in \nCivil Engineering and had spent a lot of time designing and thinking \nabout how it would be possible to improve the infrastructure in \nplaces like Khayelitsha, so that running water and waterborne \nsewerage would be available, to people who have been oppressed \nand discriminated against.\n\tShe had spent her vacations with one of the big engineering \ncompanies in the Western Cape, and during lunch time the black men \nwould come and tell her about their lives.  She would come home in \nthe evenings, and tell me the tragic stories of hopelessness and the \ndespair that they felt in never being able to get further than being \nlabourers.\n\tShe understood that.  She wept to know that that was \nhappening in her country.  She helped me to understand how subtle \nmy prejudice and bias and racial discrimination was.  But it was \nnothing blatant, it was in the very, very subtle fibres of my being.  \nShe helped me to understand that.\n\tShe was totally willing to treat everyone as an equal and she \ndid that openly and freely.  Her black friends were as important to \nher as her white friends.  \tLindiwe could have been your friend. \n You did your own cause immeasurable harm by killing her.  She was \ntotally opposed to violence.  She was a gentle person who cared for \nnot only the people, not only the little people, but the animals and \nthe flowers, the ecology of our country and the world.\n\tAs a medical person, I had to go straight back into the wards \nof Groote Schuur and treat your colleagues who had been shot and I \nneeded to do that without showing any bitterness or resentment.  \nGod gave me that grace.  \tI think the reason that I am here, \nhave been here through this week and particularly today which is \nvery important to me, is to tell you that on that day you ripped my \nheart out.  Lindi was one of the most precious people and I am \nbiased because she was my daughter, that this country could have \nproduced.\n\tI resent being called a victim, I have a choice in the matter.  I \nam a survivor.  Lindi was a victim, she had no choice.  I have just \nhad major surgery, which I trace as a direct result to the stress and \ntrauma that resulted out of the Heidelberg incident.   It has been \ndemonstrated that cancer of the colon is something that results from \ntremendous stress.  So first my heart was ripped out, and now half \nof my gut.  \n\tI am happy that you are well, I hope that emotionally and \npsychologically you can be well because my greatest concern is that \nyou have been programmed killers, you repeatedly said that you \nwere acting under orders from your high command.\n\tYou could not tell us how you felt which indicates to me that \npossibly you have been trained not to feel and I can see that that \nwould be important in a killing machine, to be unable to feel, but \njust to carry out orders indiscriminately.   And that is my greatest \nfear.\n\tI have no objection to amnesty for you, but we know there are \nenough indiscriminate killers on our streets and my fear is that we \nhave three more who are capable, because of their programming to \ndo exactly the same thing once you are released.\n\tI wished that it could be otherwise and perhaps with time and \ncounselling things can be otherwise, and I would wish that that is \npossible and that it is made available to you as it has been made \navailable to us, to have counselling for the tremendous trauma that \nwe have been through and I am sure you have been through trauma \nas well.\tBoth through the incident and through your own \nexperiences, which Lindiwe would have been delighted to hear and I \nwould be also interested in hearing how you experienced oppression \npersonally.  I have experienced oppression as a white woman and I \nam sure the oppression that you have experienced, may be much \nworse.  But I would like to know the details because that is what \nLindi would have wanted to know too.\n\tWe came here hoping to hear the truth about who the people \nin high command were who organised this whole dastedly affair.   I \nam not convinced that that truth has come out and until it is, and \ndoes come out, I am not happy that you could just disappear into the \nwoodwork.\n\tI know that it must be terribly frightening to reveal who the \nhigh command is because your own lives are in jeopardy if you do \nget amnesty, and I appreciate that it must be very, very frightening.\n\tI thank you for being able to look me in the eye and for \nhaving to hear my story.

            "Mr Chairman, I just want to go through the \npiece of my position and feelings regarding this amnesty application.\n\tFrom the 30th of December 1993, my life has never been the \nsame for obvious reasons, being in a wheelchair, having lost the use \nof my legs due to the fact that I was shot in cold blood, at point \nblank range by the three applicants.  There is a lot a person can deal \nwith and I thank God for the courage given to me and that got me \nwhere I am now.\n\tIf it was not for that courage and strength and my optimism, I \nwould not have been here today.  It is however, made very difficult \nwhen you have root nerve pain and various other forms of pain on a \ndaily basis, pains that you can hardly explain to somebody, that I \nwould never have had if this did not happen.\n\tI have lost a kidney and various parts of my intestines as well, \nas a result of the shooting.  This has been the reason and the cause \nwhy I initially ended up in hospital for several months and have \nsubsequently been in hospital again a couple of times, because of \nvarious complications.\n\tNobody will ever know what it is like, what suffering a person \nhas to go through until it has happened to you.  I would like to have \neach of the perpetrators look me in the eye and choose whether they \nwould not mind having a rifle stuck in their spines and the trigger \nbeing pulled on them in cold blood, to leave them emotionally and \nphysically scarred and disabled as I have been or would they rather \nstay in jail and serve their sentences for the crimes that they \ncommitted?\n\tThere was a freedom fight in this country for many years \nbefore, our current President, Nelson Mandela was set free in the \nearly 1990's, in fact I think it was 1991.  He became President of \nthis country due to the democratic elections that was held in April of \n1994, only four months after this horrific attack was launched on us.\n\tAll political parties had by that time, come to agreement \nalready that they are on the road to democracy in this country, \nincluding the perpetrators' party, including the PAC that had part in \nthe interim constitution that was accepted on the 3rd of December \n1993, almost or just less than a month before this attack was still \nlaunched.\n\tWhy was this attack executed, given all these things?  The \ntime period and the fact that we already embarked on a road to \ndemocracy?  It was years after everybody had already accepted, \nseveral years after it was accepted and realised that the freedom \nstruggle was over and in my opinion, and I believe that this is the \ncommon belief under South Africans, this attack was launched in a \nperiod when the struggle was over, there was no reason for any \ngroup or fraction to prove a point, by launching such attacks.\n\tThis was completely out of and after the supposed accepted \ntime frame when such terrorist attacks was executed to prove a \npoint as part of the struggle, but the struggle was already over.\n\tThis point was proved, and I can't understand why this attack \nwas still sent through.  For this very reason, I am not prepared and I \ncannot find it in my heart, to forgive them at this point in time.  I \ntherefore oppose this application for amnesty.  I do not believe that \nany murderers or criminals should be granted amnesty.  The \nmurderers and criminals have been tried, convicted and sentenced by \na Supreme Court in this country.  It proves to the ordinary person \non the street and every other criminal, that it is just another one set \nfree, or another three will be set free on our streets to roam as many \nother criminals in my belief, are still free on the streets.\n\tThe fact that the command was given by your higher \nauthorities, still does not give any, and I repeat I want to stress that \nit does not give any person the right to go out and shoot young, \ninnocent people that sat in a Tavern that night, that had no \nconnection whatsoever with the Security Forces in this country.  I \nhad no political affiliation to anybody, I was merely visiting a very \ngood lady friend of mine that has been killed in this attack, Lindi \nAnne Fourie, and I cannot see in my heart, ever, that any person has \ngot that right to walk in and take another person's life in cold blood \nwhen you don't even know who you are shooting at.\n\tLives have been taken and lives have been maimed because of \nthese orders handed down.  There is in my opinion no reason \nwhatsoever, to be such cowards, as to attack a pub full of cheerful \nyoung students in the middle of the most cosmopolitan area, \nObservatory, in Cape Town, on the eve of new year, whilst they are \nenjoying their youth together with youths of all other races, colours \nand creeds and all this whilst we were on our way to the first \ndemocratic elections in this country.\n\tI request of the perpetrators and their leaders, and I would \nlike to echo what Mrs Fourie said, that was the higher command, the \nhigher parts in the PAC and I believe, I heard what you said Mr \nChairman, that it will be looked at further, and I do hope that it will \nbe looked at further, but I request of them all, to explain to us why \nthis was done, and if they have any logical reasoning for such a \nsenseless attack at that time.\n\tMr Chairman, I oppose this request for amnesty. \n\tIn conclusion, I just want to mention for the record, that I am \nnot going into any detail whatsoever, as to my emotional suffering, \nphysical pain, absolute distress and anger, fear I went through \nduring those couple of months in hospital and the following years up \nto now, the absolute indescribable sacrifices and pain that my \nparents, my brother and my sister went through, pain and anger and \nfear that my family and friends experienced.  The humiliation of \ntrying to adjust back into a very unforgiving society as an invalid, \ndependant on people for almost everything that you have to do, \nhaving to cope with the very unfriendly environment every day of \nyour life.\n\tNeedless to say I could write, mention of write another 200 \npages just on those few points, Mr Chairman, however, I have been \nable to cope in many respects and I will continue in my positive way \nas I believe I have been. \n\tIn conclusion to all of this, I am just interested in one thing, \nMr Chairman, I want to see justice served.

He was in the company of Lindi Anne Fourie, \nBernadette Langford and David Deglon.  He sat at the same table on \nthe platform.

He \nrealised that his lower body was lame and pulled himself by his arms, \nunder one of the tables to hide.  There was pandemonium in the \nTavern.\n\tMy question to you Mr Cornelius is, why are you only saying \nthat there were two of these killers inside the Tavern because you \nsaw the video evidence?

We did a full \nrange of services from desk top publishing through to installations \nof computers.\n\tOn the night of the incident, the 30th of December 1993, \nmyself and my cousin, Grant January stopped at the Heidelberg \nTavern in Observatory.  Within minutes of entering the Tavern, we \nhad barely sat down, there were loud popping noises which I \nimmediately identified as gunfire.\n\tI wasn't at that point sure whether the gunfire was inside or \noutside the Tavern, but judged it safe to or the safest course being \nto take cover under the table at which I was sitting.\n\tEarly in the shooting, I was hit in the back of my left leg \nwhich caused extensive injuries to my leg and pelvis.  I will briefly \noutline the nature of those injuries.  The bullet resulted in a \nshattered thigh bone and I got a 40 cm steel pin which runs from my \nknee to my hip joint.  I have also since about a year after the \nincident, on the 8th of November 1994, I had a nerve graph to try \nand repair extensive nerve damage within my left leg, but this has \nnot had much effect.  With the result that my left leg is still pretty \nuseless today and I walk with a limp.\n\tI have been recommended by a family Doctor to walk at least \nwith a stick.  For the first year I used crutches exclusively, but since \n1995 I have been able to walk without the use of crutches and \nalthough on recommendation I should be using a stick, I find this \nimpractical for the type of work I do at the moment.\n\tWhile I was in hospital and on crutches and in the first few \nmonths after I was shot, the nature of my injuries was such that I \nwas unable to continue with my business.  It resulted in the loss of \nthat business.  My brother was without work and my parents were \nwithout the support I had provided them.  In fact the situation had \nbeen reversed, it was now my parents who supported me and my \nbrother was left to find employment elsewhere, which he eventually \ndid.\n\tNeedless to say, being a cripple today as it were, I have \nsuffered extensively in terms of pain, discomfort, I've had a \ncomplete change of lifestyle, the loss of my business, the loss of \nincome and the work I do today, in no way can be compared to what \nI used to do before I was so injured.\n\tIn this last four years, I have also lost many friends and \nalienated family members as a result of behaviour and personality \nchanges due to depression, frustration and bitterness.  Many days I \nwas unable to get myself out of bed in the morning, because I felt \nnot only had I lost the use of my leg, I had also lost my business, my \nincome, my whole future as it were.  Often I felt that there was no \nreason to go on, or to do anything.\n\tEven today I suffer from continuous discomfort and after a \nlong day of work, I often have to ask a family member for a massage \nto ease back pain and pain in my hip.  The loss of sensation which I \nhave suffered in my left leg, is extremely dangerous as well, as I \noften step in things or bang my leg or foot against obstructions \nwithout realising that I have done so.\n\tIf I am lucky this only results in a fall which is not too bad, \nand I have learnt to cope with it, but sometimes I have hurt myself \nmore than I realised.  \n\tRegarding my position on amnesty I would also like to say the \nfollowing.  It has been an exceptionally difficult four years since my \ndisability.  I have suffered from a great many things.  I have \nundergone various operations.\n\tI lost my business, etc.  I have continually prayed to God to \ngive me strength to face these hardships and the courage to forgive \nthe men who inflicted this disaster on my family.  This forgiveness \ndid not come easily and for many years I dreamt of vengeance as it \nwere, of somehow getting my own back, but I can now say that the \nLord God, my Saviour, has given me the strength to unconditionally \nforgive these men regardless of whether they are asking for \nforgiveness or not.  I unconditionally forgive them for what they \nhave done to me personally, however, I obviously cannot - it is not \nmy place to forgive them for what they have done to the other \npeople who have suffered as a result of their actions.  Or as it were \nfor what this country has had to go through as a result of the \nactions.\n\tI cannot say with any truth that I have forgiven the people \nwho sent them.  Neither can I say with any truth that I have forgiven \nthe system that left my family and me to suffer for the last four \nyears.  We did not receive so much as a phone call to provide us \nwith relief in the last four years, not from any person in Government \nor any Commission set up by the Government.\n\tThis is the bitterness that drives me to thinking of the Truth \nand Reconciliation Commission as no more than a mechanism of the \nsystem to forgive itself and whitewash the suffering that myself, my \nfamily and the people of this country, have endured.\n\tDespite having forgiven the men who shot me, I still wish to \nhear the truth.  Why were we victimised, what did they hope to \nachieve by what they did to us?  I can't honestly think that they \nbelieved that what they did to us, has achieved anything.\n\tI hope that these men will not receive amnesty unless they \ncome forward with the whole truth and expose all the (indistinct) \nbehind this event.  I don't know if the Truth Commission will follow \nup all the people responsible, or even if all of them have applied for \namnesty.\n\tAs a result of attending, further to the submissions that I have \nmade and which I have summarised, I also wish to say that as a \nresult of attending these hearings now and listen to the applications \nand read in fact some of the applications that has been made, I find \nit most disconcerting that the applications these men have made, are \nvery vague.\n\tIn fairness to them, I would say that regarding the position \nthey were in, they were probably not given enough time to make a \nfull application, but the impression certainly as in this hearing is that \nthe full disclosure has not been made.\n\tMore facts are continually being extracted in these hearings \nand added and amended to the applicants' statements but which for \nsome reason, was not part of the original statement, that these \napplicants have made.  For their sake, I hope that this is not \nconstrued as deliberate attempts to be vague, but for example Mr \nMadasi's admission that he was inside the Tavern, was a crucial \npiece of information which should have been in his original \nstatement.\n\tI hope that this does not negatively impact on Mr Madasi's \napplication.\n\tI do also feel that I know something of where these men come \nfrom emotionally and politically as I myself have experienced \noppression in the schools and in the townships in which I was raised. \n And yet for all that our family have experienced, I can say that my \nfamily has experienced a lot under Apartheid and under the racist \nregime of the National Party, yet, we never turned to the course \nthey took.\n\tIt has often been said by various people in Government, that \nthe actions of freedom fighters should be considered in the light that \nthey were fighting a just cause, a just and noble cause, being the \nfreedom and justice for all the people of this country.  However, in \nthe light of that cause shouldn't the actions they take to further that \ncause, reflect the nobility and the justice of the cause for which they \nare fighting?\n\tI don't think indiscriminate murder can properly be considered \nin the light of a just war.  Many freedom fighters, many soldiers for \nthe cause of liberation, have done sometimes many brave things and \nvery courageous things and all of this, in a very noble course and I \nthink that many of them, would not want to be considered as \nindiscriminate murderers.\n\tMy differences are not with these individuals though, but with \nthe mentality of an organisation which led to its soldiers and allowed \nthose soldiers to attack its own Government.  We all know that the \npeace negotiations were well on the way by the time this attack took \nplace.  In fact the National Party, the racist regime, had already \ntransferred power to the Transitional Executive Council and the \nelections was almost inevitable, but this organisation had the gall to \nallow these men to be tried and sentenced while its leaders embraced \nthe gravy train as it has been called.\n\tWhere are these leaders today?  They are hiding behind these \nmen who are being duped into losing their chance at amnesty while \nthe leaders continue on that gravy train.  I am opposed to amnesty, \nnot on the grounds of truth or the disclosure of these men, but that \namnesty cannot be given to us the survivors.\n\tMr Prior has attempted on various occasions to explain to me \nthe nature of these proceedings and amnesty, and he explained to me \nthat the word amnesty as derived from the Greek word amnesia, \nwhich means to forget.  Well, we cannot forget.\n\tA just war is understandable, but granting amnesty to people \nwho killed indiscriminately will be condoning the actions of every \nsingle individual worldwide, who has ever planted a bomb on an \nairplane, machine gunned a restaurant or killed innocent people in \nthe name of political idealism.\n\tI don't think that is the message South Africa wants to send \nout to the world that killing innocent people is justifiable, \npolitically.  If you are going to be fighting a just war, then you must \nconsider your actions in the light of the cause for which you are \nfighting.\n\tI would almost go so far as to say that the actions, not \nnecessarily by the three gentlemen I have in front of me, but the \nactions of their leaders by sending them on such an attack, I would \nalmost go so far as to say that the actions are treasonous in that \ntheir attempt was to derail the peace process and to derail the \nelections and would have resulted in great bloodshed for this \ncountry.\n\tSo their actions are treasonous to the people of this country \nand I don't believe that the attack on the Heidelberg has in any way, \nfurthered their cause.  In fact, I believe that it was a set back to \ntheir cause and in that light, their actions are treasonous to the \ncause for which they fought, or claim to have fought.\n\tThat is all I have to say at this point, Mr Chairman, thank \nyou.",

            "All right.  Please listen, and we will go through the \nstatement.  During October of 1992 my son, Brandon Clinton Palm \nwas convicted of attempted murder and robbery and sentenced to 12 \nyears imprisonment. \n\tBrandon had always maintained his innocence and after five \nyears of incarceration, still maintains that he was falsely implicated \nin these crimes by members of the Murder and Robbery Unit, Cape \nTown.\n\tBy all accounts the crimes lacked motive and seemed \nimprobable as the victim worked in the same building where my son \nwas employed as a security guard where the alleged attack took \nplace.\n\tSince 1992, my wife and I have pursued an arduous course of \nleave to appeal for retrial, review, Ministries of Law and Order, \nJustice, Correctional Services under the old and new Governments.  \nThe office of the Public Protector, Human Rights Commission, \noffice of Mandela and lastly the Truth and Reconciliation \nCommission all to no avail. \n\tAs a result of this situation, my daughter Rolanda Lucille \nPalm came to live in Cape Town in order to assist her brother and \nfamily in pursuing justice.  On the evening of the 30th of December \n1993, Rolanda and I were discussing the information she had \nobtained concerning the complainant in my son's case.\n\tWe were sitting in the Heidelberg Tavern in Observatory, \nenjoying a drink.  She had agreed to accompany me to the Tavern in \norder to get out of the house for a short while.  We left home at \nabout 10h35 pm and walked to the Heidelberg as it was five minutes \naway from my residence.\n\tOn arriving, I ushered my daughter into the restaurant area of \nthe Heidelberg, because I wanted to have a private discussion away \nfrom the noise of the music they were playing there.  On sitting her \ndown at the dining area, I walked to the bar, ordered a beer for \nmyself and a cooldrink for her.\n\tUpon sitting down at the table, I referred to my watch.  The \nreason I looked at my watch is that my daughter had just arrived \nfrom an afternoon shift at work and she was quite tired.  My \nintention was not to keep her out late.\n\tWe sat down, had a discussion which on estimate could have \nlasted for about 20 minutes.  While we were talking, I heard a \nspattered noise which was very strange.  I glanced up, over her \nshoulder to where the sound was coming from.  I noticed sparks, \nsmoke, glasses breaking.  I realised this was because someone was \nshooting into the Tavern.\n\tI did not see who was doing the shooting as my vision was \nblocked by a column in the Tavern.  On realising it was gunfire, I \nimmediately stretched over the table, pulled my daughter and said \nget down.  In that motion, I fell onto the bench and rolled onto the \nfloor.  My daughter dropped with her head to the table, and her back \nwas exposed.\n\tA hail of bullets was directed at us and a bottle and other \nthings on the table, fell onto the floor.  As I tried to look up from \nunder the table to see who was shooting, I noticed my daughter \nreaching the floor slowly.  In the same instance I noticed two other \ngirls to my right, fly out of their seats.\n\tUnfortunately all I could see was a cloud of smoke and the \nshadow withdrawing.  The next instant I saw this torch light object \nwhich knocked the side panel in the passage and rolled over to \nwhere we were.  I screamed it is a grenade, stay down, not realising \nshe was already hit.\n\tI still pressed her to the ground, under the table and counted \nto ten, waiting for this explosion.  When I realised nothing had \nhappened, I glanced over to where the object had fallen.  \nImmediately I noticed a trickle of blood on her shoulder as she was \nlying face down.  I immediately jumped from out of where I was \nlying to where she was, I turned her over and she just slumped in my \narms.\n\tI realised when looking at her, she was dead and I jumped out \nand ran to the door, to look for those responsible for the attack.  As \nI got to the door, I looked to my right and my left and immediately \nsaw a yellow van parked on the corner of Observatory and Lower \nMain Road, outside the chemist, facing Mowbray.\n\tMy immediate reaction was, oh, the Police are here already \nand I went back into the Tavern to double check on my daughter.  \nMy thoughts were that if the Police were there so soon, they had \nobviously caught the perpetrators.  I lifted my daughter up, felt for \nher pulse, but my hand just sunk into her neck.\n\tI laid her down on her back, tried to close her eyes, but they \nwould not close.  This is when the realisation got to me she was \ndead.  I immediately made my way home to tell my wife.  I was \nblinded by the shock and the tears.  I passed this van on the corner. \n When I passed, I noticed one figure there who had on a white \ngarment.\n\tWhen I got to the next corner to turn on my way home, I \nlooked back, still noticing the van standing on the corner.  Thinking \nit was very strange that for a person who had just come out of a \nplace that had been attacked, that nobody stopped me.  Well, I \nmanaged to get home all hysterical and my wife could not \nunderstand me as I was hysterical and incoherent.\n\tMy wife went to the Tavern to find out what was going on.  A \nfew days later Des Segal, the Investigating Officer came to my house \nto take a statement.  In the course of my making a statement to him, \nhe said that I must have been drunk as there was no such thing as a \nPolice van standing there.  I insisted he take it down in his statement \nand he did.\n\tHe said to me that if there was a Police van there, it must \nhave been a Police van which had been patrolling the area and had \nbeen radioed to the scene.  It must have been told not to go into the \nTavern as there was a bomb in there.\n\tI immediately became suspicious as I could not understand \nhow those Policemen could have been radioed and told about a bomb \nthat was in the Tavern.  I asked him that if they were radioed and \nknew about the attack, why they did not stop me after I had come \nout of the Tavern.  He could not answer my question and told my \nwife that I must have been drunk.\n\tAt the time of the court case, I was never used as a witness.  \nDes Segal told my wife that he could not use me as I would let the \nsuspects walk and they are APLA and they are the perpetrators and \nthey are used to killing people.\n\tHe went on to say that if they did not nail them for \nHeidelberg, he would not nail them for St James.   Am I going too \nquickly?",

            "I beg your pardon, can we correct that Mr Chairman.  \nJust delete the not.  I would like now to describe what kind of \nperson Rolanda was.\n\tShe was a kind, caring and warm hearted young woman.  She \nwas 22 years old and was a qualified primary school teacher.  She \nhad shown great tenacity and character in pursuing her studies and \nultimately qualifying.  She was determined and succeeded in making \nsomething out of her short life refusing to conform as so many \nyoung people did to the anti-social drug culture or aimless lifestyle \nso many have adopted.\n\tRolanda was a devout Christian and Roman Catholic.  She \nbelieved in the equality of man and was as a teacher dedicated to the \nupliftment of her fellow man, particularly children and the aged.\n\tShe did not support any political party.  She appalled \nviolence, particularly as a means to settle differences.  She believed \nin God and that all men were created equal, irrespective of race, \ncolour or creed.\n\tThe irony of her death is that she was not a white person who \naccording to APLA were the legitimate targets of the death squads.  \nNeither was Bernadette Langford and Michael January.  I cannot \nbegin to describe the rage I feel and have felt for the past four years \nat her senseless killing.\n\tRolanda had a tremendous zest for life.  She loved sport, \nswimming and athletics were her passion in which she excelled.\n\tI say to the PAC and APLA and to the applicants you killed \nthe wrong person.  Rolanda was also joined in the struggle against \nthe injustice of the Apartheid system, particularly in Education.\n\tYou simply ended her life as if she was a worthless piece of \nrubbish.  You say you did so to liberate AZANIA.  I say you did so \nfor your own selfish and criminal purposes.\n\tYou prevented Rolanda from helping rebuild our broken \nnation, which if you had simply waited another few months, in fact \ncame to pass when we had free elections.\n\tThere is a reference to Brigadier Nene, it is actually Brigadier \nPhitla.  The spelling in the submissions of the PAC is Phitla, but it \ncould also be spelt Fitla.  Your Commander, Brigadier Phitla stated \nthat it was difficult to control the forces on the ground due to lack \nof proper communication and proper political training.\n\tThese are simply empty excuses that in fact exposed APLA for \nwhat it was, an unguided missile out of the control of the PAC at \nloggerheads with each other and unable to accept the political \ndecisions of their political masters.\n\tThe Brigadier also stated that the cadres as in the case of the \napplicants, were simply carrying out orders of their Commanders.  \nWell, if that is so, why haven't the Commanders Letlapa Maphalela \nor Andile Mayo Sciceka applied for amnesty?  What are they afraid \nof?\n\tAPLA have stated that they were at war with the white \nsupremist settler regime and that in terms of that were their soldiers \nor cadres tasked with destroying the enemy targets, ie the white man \nwherever they found them, particularly in order to obtain firearms.\n\tWhite households and farmers were regarded as military \ntargets.  What APLA has not explained is how the Heidelberg \nTavern was selected as a military target.  If proper planning and \nsurveillance had been done, APLA would have discovered the \nfollowing.  (1) the Tavern catered for the multi-racial clientele, (2) \nthe predominant patrons were young students from the University of \nCape Town, (3) the Tavern did not cater exclusively for military \npersonnel, not could be described by any intelligent person as a \nmilitary target where arms could be obtained, (4) its resident \nmusician was one Josh Sithole, a black man who was loved and \nrespected throughout the country by multi-racial audiences \ncountrywide and who was entertaining the patrons at the time of the \nattack, (5) a better military target and that put in (indistinct), which \nfulfilled their criteria, was the Woodstock Police Station, a short \ndistance away.\n\tAPLA as well as the applicants cannot be truthful when they \nstate that by murdering patrons at the Heidelberg Tavern, this was a \nbona fide act associated with the political objective.  What these \namnesty applicants seek to do is to clothe criminal acts which have \nalready been adjudicated upon by the High Court, in the mantle of \npolitical type conduct.\n\tIt was amazing to hear from APLA military intelligence, \nBrigadier Phitla that he have never heard of the protocols of the \nGeneva Convention governing the waging of a war of liberation and \nthat he had only heard of such rules and regulations when he \nrecently joined the SANDF.\n\tIt would therefore seem that ignorance of the protection given \nto innocent civilians, unconnected to the offensive regime or its \nadministration in times of conflict, by the Geneva Convention is now \nraised as an excuse to justify the very inhumanity witnessed at the \nHeidelberg Tavern.\n\tI maintain that the perpetrators of the killings, when they \nentered the Tavern, could have as trained soldiers so we are told, \nassessed the situation and seen first hand that the people they were \ngoing to kill, in fact were not the targets they were ordered to kill \nand could have turned back, but they did not.\n\tThe systematic shooting of the patrons as they did, three \nfemales deceased, together with the attempt to explode the nail \nstudded rifle grenade was not to further any political objective.  \nWhat does APLA command mean when it says that it assumes \ncomplete responsibility for the Heidelberg Tavern attack?\n\tDoes APLA command realise that with responsibility comes \naccountability?  I repeat my question, if APLA is genuine about \ntaking responsibility, why have none of the Commanders applied for \namnesty?\n\tHowever, APLA tells the world that for what they did at the \nHeidelberg Tavern and to my daughter, they will never apologise.  \nThe killings at Heidelberg Tavern and the attempted justification \nthereof by the APLA command, must be viewed soberly against the \nbackground of the political reality as of 30th December 1993.\n\t(1) The peace process had progressed towards democracy and \nthe first ever democratic elections were only months away, in fact in \nApril 1994, (2) the PAC which must have informed its military wing, \nAPLA, had committed to the peace process and was a willing and \nvociferous participant, (3) the PAC had in November of 1992 \npledged a cessation of violent struggle and imposed a moratorium of \nviolence.  It was reported in the Rapport newspaper on the 2nd of \nJanuary 1994, (4) the Apartheid Government had handed control to \nthe politically negotiated TEC until the elections only a short time \naway.\n\tHistory indicates that a politically negotiated settlement had \nin fact won the day.  The liberation struggle had delivered the \ngoods.  The was was over and that majority ruled.   It seems from \nthe submissions made by APLA on the 7th of October 1997, before \nthe TRC, that APLA had on its own decided the war was not over \nand in order to keep its support from its followers, it had to be seen \nto be retaliating against white people because black people were still \nbeing killed.\n\tIf this was the rational behind the attacks, then in this context \nthe Heidelberg attack was nothing more than a reprisal or revenge \nattack.  If this is so, political objective cannot be argued.  What the \nact of terror did achieve, was the broad condemnation by all \npolitical groups as well as international rebuke.\n\tBoth Zimbabwe and Tanzania are reported to have severely \nrebuked APLA, reported in Argus newspaper, 12 January 1994.  The \nANC condemned the killing as being acts of (indistinct) aimed at \nderailing the peace process and preventing free and fair elections, \nreported in the Rapport, 2nd of January 1994.\n\tDespite the numerous TRC hearings, amnesty applications and \nPolice investigations involving hundreds of personnel, thousands of \nman hours and possibly millions of rands, we are still no nearer the \ncomplete truth not only in the Heidelberg Tavern matter, but in all \nothers where gross violations of human rights occurred.\n\tI firmly believe that a wider conspiracy exists which is yet to \nbe uncovered.  I shall not rest until it has been and only then \nperhaps, shall I be satisfied that justice has been seen to be done and \nonly then, if those faceless and gutless politicians, military and \nSecurity Force personnel are exposed and prosecuted to the full \nextent of the law.\n\tMy unease in this regard is as a result of the following \ncircumstances.  (1) although I witnessed the attack, saw a Police van \non the scene, I was bullied by Des Segal, the Investigator, to forget \nthat fact.   When I refused, he tried to discredit me by saying that I \nwas probably drunk at the time and if I did say what I had seen, at \nthe trial, it would upset the Prosecution.  As a result I was kept out \nof the witness box.  If Segal had simply explained why a van could \nhave been there, I would possibly have accepted it and called it a \nday. \n\t(2) What was the Police doing there in the first place, where \nwere the occupants and what were they doing?\n\t(3) The Police investigation had within a very short space of \ntime, three or four days, solved the case despite six persons arrested \nand charged, only three perpetrators stood trial.  The charges were \nwithdrawn against the rest.  If the evidence was strong enough to \narrest and charge them, why were they not prosecuted?  Was the \nconspiracy only limited to these six?  These persons were Theo \nMabusela, Michael Siyolo and Richard Dala.\n\t(4) The person who supplied the weapons and ammunition to \nthe perpetrators were known to the Police.  Were they arrested and \nlater released or are they still at large?\n\t(5) Letlapa Maphalela, the Director of Military Operations of \nAPLA is implicated in Heidelberg Tavern, yet is allowed to go free. \n He is not applying for amnesty for the Heidelberg Tavern, nor has \nhe been arrested.\n\t(6) Other implicated persons are Basie Mcombusi and \nTheofolus Sibeko.  Why are they still at large?  There whereabouts \nare known to the authorities?\n\t(7) Denzil Potgieter who defended the killers of my daughter, \nnow is a Commissioner of the very Committee called upon to grant \nthem amnesty.\n\t(8) Dumisa Ntsebeza, a Commissioner with the TRC, has been \nmentioned in connection with the Heidelberg Tavern attack in that it \nis alleged that his vehicle was used in some way or the other.\n\t(9) Des Segal died in a car crash early this year.  In the \nwreckage an R4 rifle, an RPG rocket launcher was found.  The press \nreport talked about a possible link with the notorious Vlakplaas.  I \nrealise some two years have elapsed between these two events, but \nsomehow I can only attack some sinister meaning to this.  The public \nhave heard no more about Segal's R4 rifle, strangely it is the same \ntype of weapon used in the Heidelberg Tavern incident.  My \nquestion is whether this weapon has been tested or checked to see \nwhether it was the same one used at the Heidelberg Tavern.  I \nappeal to the Amnesty Committee to urgently order an inquiry into \nthe Des Segal affair.\n\t(10) As at the 30th December 1993, the murders at Heidelberg \nTavern fell outside the time frame set for amnesty applications, yet \nit was decided to extend this cut off date.  My question is why?\n\tI have a perception that the real perpetrators of the most evil \nacts, are not going to be exposed and that the wrap will fall on the \nfew hirelings who did their bidding.  People who by their own \nadmission have committed gross violations of human rights and who \nare required simply to tell the truth, are assisted by high powered \nlegal representatives in order to do so.\n\tIn the majority of these cases, other than Heidelberg, the \nfunding of these lawyers is paid for by the very victims against who \nthey apply for amnesty from criminal prosecution or civil liability.\n\tI have lost two children to the system, my son to the \nApartheid system of justice and my daughter at the hands of killers \nthat the system seems to protect.\n\tIn an attempt to find out who politically was also guilty of the \nacts of murder at Heidelberg Tavern, I approached members of the \nPAC namely Ms De Lille, Barny Desai and Richard Zinani.  Ms De \nLille told me that she had personally spoken to the applicants in this \namnesty application and that they had steadfastly denied involvement \nin the killing.  I have noticed that the applications for amnesty of the \napplicants say very little about the actual attack.\n\tGqomfa suggests that the attack was launched from outside \nthe Tavern.  He does not suggest that anyone entered the premises \nand shot whilst inside.   Madasi and Mabala had given no details \nwhatsoever.  I am forced to wonder why not.\n\tIs this a tactic?  Have they not yet decided what to say and \nwho to implicate or will those details only be filled in after \nconsultation with the hierarchy of the PAC or APLA?\n\tI also wonder whose interest ought to safeguarded here.  I \nurge this Committee that common sense and justice prevail in your \nassessment of the evidence and refuse amnesty.  I do not wish to \ndwell on my personal circumstances, however, I have been advised \nthat such information is important to reveal to you.\n\tThe pain of losing my son was compounded a million times by \nthe death of my daughter.  I felt responsible and guilty for both of \nthem.  I have lived with that for the past four years.\n\tMy personality has changed.  I have not been able, despite \nextensive therapy and counselling at Valkenberg Hospital, to shed \nthe anger, rage, guilt, feelings of revenge and helpless desperation at \nthe system that allows murderers to escape punishment.\n\tSuffice to say my marriage has suffered irreparable harm.  My \nwife suffers from extreme anxiety and nervous tension.  We are both \non constant medication.  I am not being able to forgive the killer of \nmy daughter Rolanda, and cannot be a hypocrite and say so when my \nheart has feelings of murderous rage towards them and their \nmasters.\n\tFinally, I challenge the leader of the PAC, Bishop Magoba, \nnot to justify atrocities like Heidelberg Tavern with reference to \nsimilar atrocities perpetrated by the Apartheid regime, but to \nacknowledge it as a gross violation of the human rights of all those \nyoung people who were killed and maimed and to name all those \nwho were involved in the authorization, planning and execution of \nthe attack  so that the truth will be known.\n\tThis was dated at Cape Town on the 27th of October, that \nwas Monday, 1997.

As for \namnesty, whether I oppose it or not, they will definitely be freed to \ncontinue their devious work by repossession or whatever they can \nlay their filthy paws on, even if it does not belong to them.\n\tAPLA have taken from us one of the most precious gifts the \nLord can ever give us, my daughter was everything a mother, a \nfather and brothers and sisters could ever want.  And the void her \ndeath has left us all, an and will never be filled again.\n\tI will never in all the time left to me, forgive anyone that had \na hand in her death.  I ask God every day to understand and forgive \nme for feeling all this hatred and contempt that I have for her \nmurderers.  My daughter was the type of person that would have \nwanted me to forgive these killers, as she believed in our Creator.\n\tI would just like to thank the Commission for taking the time \nto read my letter and I will also like to ask the Commission if they \ncould read this letter to the amnesty applicants because I would like \nthem to know exactly how we feel.  Thanking you in anticipation, \nMrs M.E. Palm.",

            "Yes.  Mr Chairman, I am going to skip all the other \ndetail and just read from paragraph 3 onwards.  His personal details \nand employment history is clear.  Thank you Mr Chairman.\n\tRegarding the incident, paragraph 3 at page 73 of the bundle \nof submissions, you said as follows   I had been on duty at \nMachados restaurant on the night of the 30th of December 1993 \nwhen the incident in question took place.\n\tThe restaurant had been quite full that evening, being the \nfestive season and everyone was in a jolly mood.  After the \nrestaurant had closed, the owner Joe Cerqueira, his brother and \nanother colleague whose name I can't remember, had been clearing \nthe restaurant and set about preparing the restaurant for the next \nday's business.\n\tWhen we heard what we assumed was a car backfiring in the \nroad outside, the sound continued and we thought that it may also \nbe the sound of fireworks thrown by some partygoers outside.  I was \nthe first to walk out of the restaurant to investigate and was \nfollowed by my colleagues.\n\tI saw individuals coming out of the Heidelberg Tavern, which \nis located next to Machados restaurant.  They were making their way \nto a dark coloured car.  I saw what again I thought was flares or \nfireworks and then noticed these individuals were firing automatic \nmachine gun fire in all directions.\n\tOnce they spotted me and my colleagues, they fired in our \ndirection.  In the resulting confusion, we pushed our way back into \nthe restaurant and took cover as best we could.  I remember lying \nflat on the floor of the restaurant.\n\tOnce the firing had stopped, I ran out of the restaurant.  It \nwas at this stage I saw the deceased, Joe Cerqueira lying, dying in \nthe gutter, he had been shot in the chest.  The result was complete \nmayhem as people ran around in shock, shouting for help.  It was \nonly at this stage, when I knelt down next to the deceased that I \nrealised that I had been shot in the leg.\n\tMy thoughts at that stage were about Joe Cerqueira and I \nremember thinking Joe, you can't die now.  The exact details of what \nhappened after that are not clear to me.\n\t4.  The effect of the incident.  A month after the shooting, my \nlife had fallen to pieces.  I withdrew totally from the day to day \nactivities of life.  Interests that I once had such as mountain \nclimbing were now of no importance to me.\n\tI withdrew from all sporting activities that I had been \ninvolved in.  I began drinking alcohol heavily, suffered insomnia and \na lack of concentration of things going on around me.  The most \ntraumatic effect that this had on me, has been the loss of contact \nwith those closest to me, my family.\n\tI was referred to professional help to the psychology \ndepartment of Groote Schuur Hospital.  I also saw a psychiatrist at \nthe hospital, who diagnosed me as suffering from post traumatic \nstress and was placed on medication for one year.\n\tAfter the incident I applied for a job at the Crab Shack \nrestaurant in Milnerton.  During my first shift deliveries were being \nmade to the restaurant via the back entrance.  I was unaware of the \ndelivery and when I saw the black gentleman walking into the back \nentrance, I thought this could also be an attack on the restaurant.  I \nbroke in a sweat and had a panic attack.\n\tResulting in the fact that I broke down and was unable to \ncontinue working at the restaurant.  I never returned to this \nrestaurant, the realisation as how quickly one's life can be taken \nbecame a nightmare for me.  Joe's death had effected me adversely \nand as I feel I have become a total nervous wreck.\n\tI was once again referred to the out-patient department of \nGroote Schuur Hospital and also to the welfare department, who \nafter consulting with me, applied for disability family grant.  It was \nalso recommended that I attend Valkenberg Hospital for further \nobservation.\n\tBecause of the connectation attached to Valkenberg Hospital, \nI refused and stayed away.  I feel as if I have become a monster.  I \nfeel distanced from my family and unable to guide them as leader of \nthe household.  My life seems to be a constant see saw in that I feel \nup one day, and down the next.\n\tI feel as if my manhood has been taken away from me.  I \nseldom feel as if I would be able to be a normal person again.\n\tMy view regarding the amnesty application.   If this had been \nan accident, I could find it in my heart to forgive the applicants.  \nThis was purely a terrorist attack for which the applicants had \nwillingly trained and executed their orders.  And they too, like those \nof us who have suffered the trauma because of this incident, should \npay the price.\n\tI am sure they were reimbursed by their employers, something \nthat we have not been.  I therefore oppose the application for \namnesty for these individuals. \n\tHow I see the future.  The future seems bleak for me and my \nfamily as I have been unable to hold down a permanent job.  The \ninability to be the leader of my family, has been debilitating to say \nthe least and I really fear for the future of my children.\n\tReparation and compensation.  I feel that what has been taken \naway from me and my family, should be compensated for and I \nwould appreciate the Reparation Committee to look into this.  \nSigned at Cape Town, the 22nd of October 1997.\n\tDo you confirm that statement?",

Is this a man or not?\n\tRight, you are men, I am a man, I will talk straight to you and \nto the Chairman.  How do you know that you fatally wounded Mr \nJose Cerqueira, are you a seasoned or regular killer?\n\tYou pleaded not guilty at the trial, yet you say here that you \nintended killing and wounding as many people as possible and now \nsay you want amnesty.  How do I understand you?\n\tMr Chairman, I do find it very difficult to accept that the \nstatements given by these people are genuine, genuinely from them \nand perhaps not some concocted story to save their necks.  I am \nbeing blunt Sir, and I apologise if I do that, and I offend anybody, \nbut I am also not apologising.\n\tAccepting that I was not at the scene of the crime, I still \nbelieve I may ask why must I believe you when you say you did not \nenter the Tavern, when you say anything for that matter because \nbearing in mind what you have admitted to, that is the killing of \ninnocent people.\n\tI cannot believe anything you say because I cannot trust \nmurderers.  Why must I believe your statement about why you think \nyou should be absolved of this crime, the murder of my daughter and \nothers?\n\tThe post mortem should reveal quite accurately how close the \nkillers were to the victims when they were shot.  I refer to page 12 \nin the court proceedings, three young women were shot that evening \nin the Heidelberg Tavern.  It is on page 44 of the bundle.  \nBernadette Langford's heart was torn apart by the impact of the \nbullet, Lindi Anne Fourie was shot in the right hand side of the \nneck.  The bullet dragged all of the main blood veins off, and \ncrushed her neck bones.  Rolanda Palm was also shot in the heart.\n\tIf we were firing wildly, how coincidental is it Mr Chairman, \nthat three of the victims were shot in positions which would \ncertainly have meant virtually instant death?  I also was trained in \nthe use of firearms.  It is a frightening reality that lives with me \nevery day of my wife, I regret having been trained to aim at another \nhuman being and shoot.  I hope to God I never will have to do it.  \nThat is sincere and from my heart.\n\tThe apparent attitude of the applicants and particularly the \nso-called Commander of these men, tells me that their bona fides \ncould be suspect and essentially destroys their possible chances of \nbeing given amnesty.\n\tExcusme me Mr Chairman, I highlighted what I wanted to \nrefer to from the notes.",

Because one of your so-called leaders, \nspeaking for all of you supposedly, on page 21 of their statement \nsaid the following and he was here on the 7th of October.

I am greatly disturbed by \nthat Sir and it would appear that this has been carried over to these \npeople.\n\tMr Madasi, your impatience was very evident whilst you were \nbeing asked questions by Adv Prior.  Why do you get impatient and \nbear your teeth, you are asking and if you want to receive, surely \nyou need to ask in a reasonably humble and if not civilised manner \nand tone of voice.\n\tI would like to caution the applicants that perhaps they are \nbetter off in jail, than out on the street and I will just give you one \nreason.  I arrived home two days ago only to read in a newspaper \nfive armed robberies in 48 hours in the little dorp where I live.  \nYou've got competition and I am not being flippant here.\n\tBeware of your attitude Mr Mabala, you are asking for \nsomething, something bigger than you care to think about whilst you \nwere busy with your dirty work.  So it is not in your best interest to \nappear cheeky or impatient, even when your own Defence Counsel \nasks you questions, questions that you are required to answer before \nyour request can even be considered.\n\tNow, I will say something which you might find strange, but I \nam still a person, okay, despite my anger and my hurt.  Have you \nseen an elderly person crying, look at me today, just look at this.  \nTo the three and all of you related to this matter, I would not like to \nbe in your shoes.  I also feel very, very sorry for your parents and \nothers who are interested in you because they've got to bear it with \nyou and with us.  That is very difficult.\n\tMr Chairman, I wrote to a few people asking them to tell us \nwho Lindi Anne was because I thought perhaps the Committee here \nwould like to get a different perspective onto the type of person, as \nto the type of person that Lindi Anne was.

He addressed it to \nthe Chairman, it is from a Mr A.W. Hall.\n\tHe said  \n\t\t\"re the Heidelberg Tavern murder.  I have known the \nFourie family for many years and can remember Lindi \nAnne virtually from birth.  I carried her on my \nshoulders when she was a child and I remember her as a \nyoung girl who was mad about horses and loved \nanimals.\n\t\tI remember her as a shy and conscientious schoolgirl \nand I remember her showing off the magnificent matric \ndance dress that she had made herself.  Lindi Anne had \na strong character and an enquiring mind and was not in \nthe least bit surprised when I learnt that she had chosen \ncivil engineering as a career.\n\t\tIn fact being a civil engineer myself, I was proud of her. \n The one thing that never failed to impress me about \nLindi Anne was her pleasant and gentle nature.  She \ngave the impression that she didn't have an enemy in the \nworld.\n\t\tLindi Anne was not class or race conscious and \naccepted people as they were.   She always looked for \nthe good in people.  She had grown into a charming and \ntalented young lady who would, I am sure, have become \na valuable citizen and would have contributed positively \nto the future of this country had she not been murdered \nin her prime a few short months before graduating as a \ncivil engineer.\n\t\tI cannot express the anger I felt when I learnt of the \nsenseless murder at the Heidelberg Tavern, quite apart \nfrom the obvious anguish and irreplaceable loss suffered \nby her family and friends, our nation has been deprived \nof a really good above-average person, that had so \nmuch to offer society, murdered by a bunch of morally \nbankrupt nobodies, who have nothing to offer anyone.  I \nwill be extremely disappointed if those responsible for \nLindi Anne's death, are granted amnesty.\n\t\tAt the time of the attack, the political climate in south \nAfrica was already changing dramatically and I cannot \nsee that the perpetrators of the attack, can justify their \nactions on political grounds in any way whatsoever.\n\t\tMy feelings are not biased on racism.  Civilisation is \nnot man's natural state, it is an ideal that requires \nconstant and diligent effort.  We all harbour violent \nthoughts from time to time, but the difference between \na civilised person and a barbarian, like the Worcester \nbombers and the Heidelberg murderers, is that the latter \nhave no moral integrity to guide their actions.\n\t\tSuch people are a menace to any community and should \nbe removed from society permanently\".\n\tMr Chairman, I will close with the statement that I have, one \nparagraph Sir.  \n\tYou see Mr Chairman, for too long now, I want the people \nhere to hear this, a few people in this country of ours, have had any \nrespect for each other, the people, the courts, not anything that \nresembles a normal society.  Do wish to see this type of thinking \ncontinue?\n\tNobody in their right mind would wish it to continue, \ntherefore I have empathy for you, the Police, the Justice system and \nall others who are trying to bring about a change of attitude and \nhopefully a change in behaviour of all people, so as to ensure a \nreturn to a normal and safe society.\n\tMay you be granted all the courage and strength necessary to \ncarry out the task that you face.
