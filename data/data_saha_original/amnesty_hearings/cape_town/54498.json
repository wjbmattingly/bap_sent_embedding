            "Be that as it may I would like to read to you from the judgment given by Judge Els.  Chairperson it is Volume G, page 62, the Judge refers to WPJ Smit, better known as Willy Smit, who testified that he met the accused in the mid-eighties.  That he himself, in 1987 worked at ACA Insurance and that the accused also worked there for a period of two to three months.  He states that it was during 1988.\n\"When the accused left ACA Insurance he told Smit that he would be working for the Security Police and that he was going to monitor activists primarily.  During February the witness began his own business by the name of Profsure.  The accused regularly visited the new business and on an ad hoc basis did work for Smit.  The accused and the accused's brother, Calla Barnard...\"\nand it is not Calla Botha, but Calla Barnard who is your brother.....\n\"...visited him one evening.  He said it was during one and two in the morning and they told him that they were busy monitoring a certain Mr White, the complainant with Charge 3, and that they had then been taken in by the Security Police.  The accused state that they wanted to take out Mr White as well.  The accused asked the witness if he was aware of Dr Webster's death and told him that he, the accused, had shot Dr Webster.\"\nSmith testifies -\n\"They told me that it had been one of their instructions, among others, to take out Mr White as well and that Mr White had been a personal friend of Dr Webster's.\"\nAt a certain stage after Colonel J Smit asked the witness, Smit, this is now Willy Smit, the accused again came to him and once again repeated that he had shot Dr Webster.  He then testifies as follows:\n\"Your Lordship he told us this various times.  It was general knowledge.  He told this to anyone who wanted to listen.  He said that he had shot Dr Webster.  On another occasion the accused stated that he had shot Webster with a shotgun.  On an occasion Smit made a statement to W/O Rossouw, as he was then, who was the detective regarding the death of Dr Webster.  The following day, the accused's brother, Calla Barnard and the father of the accused visited him, Smit, and requested him to make a statement in which he would state that everything he had previously told Rossouw was really hearsay and that he didn't have any personal knowledge of the facts that he gave to Rossouw.  Later he made a statement with the objective of the Webster post mortem inquest and what is contained in there is the truth.  The statement was made on the 16th of October 1992 and on the 28th of October 1992 he testified during the Webster post mortem inquest.  He stated that what he said on the 28th of October 1992 in evidence was the truth.\n\t\tOn the following day he was placed under cross-examination by Advocate or attorney Pietie du Plessis who appeared on behalf of the accused and Calla Botha during the post mortem inquest.  During cross-examination there was an adjournment at approximately 11 o'clock that morning.  During the adjournment a certain Mr Mouton approached him and asked him how it was possible that he, Smit, could testify against a fellow Afrikaner.  Mouton also said to him that he was busy playing with his family's future.  (This is the family of the witness).  He understood that his children could be harmed.  During that time Smit was having an extra-marital affair with his secretary.  Mouton asked Smit whether his wife was aware of this extramarital affair and when he responded in the negative Mouton informed him that Attorney Pietie du Plessis would disclose this directly after the adjournment in court.  He asked Mouton what he was supposed to do, upon which Mouton stated that he should deny everything that he had testified to at that stage and that it would be the easiest way for Smit to escape the situation.  Smit's advocate, Adv H de Vos requested an adjournment of a few days from the court.  This request was refused and the cross-examination of Smit by Attorney du Plessis was continued.  Upon everything that Attorney du Plessis then put to him he stated \"I concede\" or he confirmed what was put to him although it was completely in contradiction with his original evidence.\"\nDo you recall this Mr Barnard?",

I know how the police operate, I know that there are records of everything that takes place and so forth, and during the tea adjournment I went to phone Mr Fuerter(?) and General Hume, they consulted their pocket books and they saw that what I had said is something that he knew about.

Joe Verster and I do not sit, agree with many things and over a period of time, especially after they incriminated me during the post mortem inquest of Dr Webster two weeks before the beginning of the proceedings here, after three years I received a message from Joe Verster in the prison via one of my visitors, a former Koevoet member, that he sends his regards, he has got a lot of respect for me and the way in which I handled myself. And it was very surprising that first of all he made contact in such a way.  And then I met Calla Botha and I felt sorry for Joe in his evidence because there is something in me that does not want to make me sell other people out and want me to make people go to prison.  And I thought to make it a bit easier for him I told Mr Botha to give Mr Verster a message that I did not want him to testify here and keep this thing\nin the back of his mind that they he is taking a certain direction with his evidence and later I come and say no Verster gave the instruction.  That's how I felt about it at that stage.  Then I sent the message that I will not answer questions concerning Webster.  I will tell this Commission to go to hell.  And that was my words.  But then Mr Botha came back to me and he was a bit unhappy about Joe and he said you must do what you want you.  Then I left it.  And I said I am not going to turn around now and that did not force me to continue, I would have done it as stated before.  \tThe next day, that was still during the first sitting there was a tea-break, or lunch break where I was not immediately removed from the hall, then Joe Verster walked in, I was sitting here with the guards guarding me, then he came to sit next to me, and he asked me \"how are you?\".  I said \"no alright, and you?\". And he said \"fine\".  And he said things looked difficult and he said good luck, and he told me then he received my message, he thought about it and that's how I experienced it, he received my message and I said well this is my attitude, I am not going to tell them that you gave the instruction.  I will not testify about Webster at all.  This Commission must go to hell.  And that's how I felt about it.  Then he thought that he could manipulate me further and he patted me on the back and he told me to \"fuck up the General\".  And at that stage the people walked in.  I was surprised.  I did not know what to say to him.  I did not answer him, I just looked at him like that.  But I did mention it to General Webb because he sat next to me.  And I spoke to him and I said to him \"General I never received an instruction from you concerning the Webster case\", and I also tested him and he said \"but I never gave that instruction\", and that was his attitude.

            "CHAIRPERSON",
            "Thank you very much Mr Bizos, that's much appreciated.\n\tYes unfortunately we won't be able to carry on today.  We've lost some time but for understandable reasons.  I have just been reminded now by my colleague Mr Lax that we were informed that Correctional Services, who transport Mr Barnard to and fro, have made an arrangement for him, it's no longer necessary for him to leave at quarter to four as it was in the past.  They have made that arrangement and also they can start earlier.  Now I know the objection to starting at nine o'clock but is it possible, perhaps, for next week to make an arrangement where we can sit longer days like starting at nine and hitting through to five-ish.  I know that you've got practices to run and other business to do but if you could arrange your affairs for the one week our time is running out, we'd like to get as far as possible with this hearing.  We still have the evidence of a couple of witnesses who may take some time as well.  So we are going to struggle to finish next week.\n\tWe will adjourn to next Monday and try to start at half-past nine on Monday, because they have to set up.  The first day is always the set-up day but after that if we could start at nine in the mornings it would be better.\n\tWe will adjourn now until next Monday, 2nd of October at 9H30 at this venue.  I am told that it is going to be in this room on Monday.  We will adjourn until then.  Thank you very much.\nCOMMITTEE ADJOURNS",
