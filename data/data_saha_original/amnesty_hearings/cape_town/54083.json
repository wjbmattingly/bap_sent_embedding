            "Chairperson, if you would grant me the opportunity to answer that question.  In documentation that was available to me, documents of the past eleven or ten years, I would just like to say as background that there was a dispute before the Harms Commission between myself and Gen Webb.  That dispute entailed the fact that I had authorised the project but that Gen Webb could not recall it.\n\tThe Harms Commission - and I think today it is still true, that the approaches and the evidence of the previous government's side was in my opinion an attempt to firstly assist the Police and secondly to expose the CCB, and thirdly to grant the opportunity to the previous government to get away.  I opposed it.  I was at the Harms Commission against my own will.  I said here that I had claimed privilege to certain things, I later corrected everything and in terms of documents I did correct those things.   \n\tAnd it happened to me in the Harms Commission that at some stage I stayed away from the Harms Commission when I had to lead evidence because I said that I had a problem with the Harms Commission and then the government, by 10 o'clock that evening, would tell me that they would withdraw my legal team if I did not appear the following day in the Commission.  All these things are in writing.  So I do admit that then for those reasons I had misled the Harms Commission and I do admit that I did so because I was in complete isolation.  For example, it was quite obvious to me and I have put it here before you already, that newspaper reports from the State's side with regard to for example the financial plan, the financial plan was forged before me and there was said that there was a distinction between internal operations and external operations, which was never the case.  For example, this made me think that Gen Webb could be told by the higher structures of the State, it could have been a direct instruction from the Minister, that under no circumstances should internal action be approved because now we have made a distinction with regard to the financial plan.  The money that was spent for Dullah Omar and Evans and so forth, were irregular expenditures in terms of a financial plan that was forged after three years as if that was the policy.  The implication of that forgery was that we had used money from 1986 in such a manner which had now changed in 1989, according to which we had been audited now.\n\tFurthermore, Gen Badenhorst told me that \"leave Slang van Zyl, I will look after him, I'll speak to him.\"",

And you should keep in mind that there was no clear law with regard to amnesty as we have now.  \n\tI am also not here to attack the personality of Gen Webb, but that incident was the direct cause of my attitude that was applicable in the Harms Commission, which place in documents all over.  And in 1993, later, I think it was in 1993, there was an application for amnesty where even my legal representation told me that I have to apply in terms of the law and I insisted that a statement of mine be attached to it in which I said that what happens here and what happened with the Harms Commission, it was against my will, I did not want to apply for amnesty, it is the government who are trying to expose these aspects, they are trying to find the culprit for the whole system and at that stage with regard to the - I concentrated on the monitoring because that dispute had not been resolved yet and for the reasons I have put forward here.  And later when I made contact with Region 6 again, I found out that they were under the same pressure as I.  I did not have access to my premises, I did not have access to the files there, I did not have an income, I was locked up and placed under detention as the Managing Director, and this indicated the ambit of the problem and I later corrected it and ...(intervention)",

            "About a week.  And in that week - you must keep in mind that the statements of, I think, Kalla Botha and Ferdi Barnard and Slang and the rest, their statements were already there and the police then tried to interrogate me, but I did not speak to anyone.  I think eventually I answered a question for 15 minutes in detention but it was part of this intimidation attempt.  I do know the names of the persons.  And during the Harms Commission I was there to supplement this thing about another incident for which I've already received amnesty, when I said that I will no longer lie along and according to the State's plans and I was called by a Brigadier and he said that \"the Minister says that tonight we will withdraw your legal team if you do not speak up the following morning 8 o'clock.\"  And that night I decided I shall not speak to anyone any longer and that night I decided that to prevent the further lies, I will not go to the Commission at all, but nobody knew this.\n\tThe following morning the telephone rang and it was Gen Jan Geldenhuys and Gen Jan Geldenhuys then said that he wishes me luck - this was the first time that he called me, and they were all concerned whether I would expose them the following day or not.  Then I just stayed away and the reaction to this stay-away of mine as a witness, who was the Managing Director of this terrible CCB, said that they will get me in future.  To me it was as if it was a confirmation that things were happening here in the Commission that were purposefully aimed against the CCB and myself as a person.  \n\tI would like to just get back to the authorisation.  I understand what the current circumstances are, I feel that I am not dependent on the approval of Gen Webb, I am not afraid to admit anything, I'm not afraid of anyone.  I admit - and it is in writing, that I had signed the documents, but it is not practically possible in the financial plan as it was originally correct, that I could commence projects that I under the command of Gen Webb, could steal money from his headquarters where I may not go or could receive a limpet mine from his stores where I could not go.  Or whatever came from Special Forces, it was not possible for me to go there to go and get it.  But there was a written principle guideline for all Commanders, and that was that a Commander functions two levels down.  That means that Gen Webb can speak to me at my level and he can speak to Staal Burger, I can speak to Christo Britz and Slang van Zyl, or I may speak to Christo Britz and Staal Burger, but the detail on the ground, I do not have the direct facts, but my responsibility is to those two levels and ...(intervention)",

So it could have easily have happened that we spoke about Region 6 and I present all the regions to the Chairperson, the General, he knows what the projects were, but there could have been a misunderstanding, the way I interpreted it, where he said yes.  But that project was not just put together just like that, it was just a following step that had developed over five months, in yearly, quarterly and half-yearly presentations and the final presentation was before there was a clear decision about it.  And I will accede that Gen Webb may have misunderstood me.  I have already said that I authorised it.  Now that authorisation was part of the State's manner to prove that Verster was doing what he wanted to do, Verster had developed and established a secret organisation and used 30-million and used this to make war.  I stand by my point that that is not what I did.  And afterwards I realised that the region would have a further problem if I do not stand by what we have said, and that is that the project had been authorised and that we had received money in a legal manner and equipment was received in a legal way, and everywhere I put it in that manner.

Exhibit G, Chairperson.\n\"Now we are ad idem that there was a project with regard to, existed with regard to Gavin Evans.  That is as I have told you, it was with regard to monitoring.\"\n\t\t\"No, I refer to a project to eliminate Gavin Evans.\"\n\t\t\"No, there was no such authorisation.\"\n\t\t\"There was no such authorisation.

I say once again I was in complete isolation, that is in regard to what I have now discussed here with you, and I could have been locked up again.  I could one again have submitted that I did these things on my own.  There was a history from the time when we experienced problems, where Gen Webb disappeared as Commander, he was not available to me, he told me to continue on my own.\n\tNow afterwards it is easy to speak of it, he knew what his responsibilities were and it is indeed because he did not want to own up that we had managed a joint project, he knew exactly what the role and function of the CCB was, maximal destruction of the enemy, and the whole attitude was that \"you, Verster, take responsibility for this, I don't know of anything\".  And I understand why he did this, but in Act 44/97, and it is put in writing by myself as such, there are specific actions which we call \"conduct in action\", how a Commander in the face of the enemy - this was a revolutionary war and this was the enemy, how a Commander had to act with regard to his subordinates.  And I put it to Gen Webb, Mr Chairperson, and I put it to the rest of the Army, they knew what instructions they gave me and they did not on the same level look at me and acted against me as I looked at my persons.  And that is why there is no more documentation why Gen Webb tried to convince the government and how he tried to iron out the projects and how we acted as a link between the CCB and the Generals in Staff, or the rest of the State.

In other words, if something has to be done with regard to the files, that was the intention that you.\"\n\t\t\"No, no, listen, earlier on you told me that according to this emergency plan these members of Region 6 are not in possession of Region 6 files and because of the institution of the emergency plan, is that correct\"?\n\t\t\"Yes.\"\n\t\t\"Now why did you say here in this affidavit - 'Up to date of this I was not able to contact all the members of management of the region and consequently I could not determine where the files were which have regard to this region.'?\"\n\t\t\"That is now Region 6?\"\n\t\t\"That is correct.\"\n\t\t\"But that is an untruth because you knew that they were not in possession of it, because the emergency plan was already instituted.\"\n\t\t\"But perhaps when I drew up this statement I did not think that the files would be such a great issue.\"\n\t\t\"Come on now, that is why for that reason you did not speak the truth.\"\n\t\t\"No, I did not speak an untruth, I perhaps did not see it in that manner at that stage.\"\n\t\t\"What did you not see?\"\n\t\t\"That now as you have put it now.\"\n\t\t\"That it is an untruth?\"\n\t\t\"No, I did not intend it as an untruth.\"\n\t\t\"But it is an untruth as it is stated there, do you agree?\"\n\t\t\"Under the circumstances I did not look at it with the same insight.  I do not think that I spoke an untruth here.\"\n\t\t\"As it is stated there, is it not an untruth?\"\n\t\t\"No, as it is stated there it is to me the truth.\"\n\t\t\"Then I don't know what the truth is, then I have serious problems comprehending what you are trying to tell me.  An emergency plan is instituted, the members of Region 6 as consequence of this, were not in possession of the files, but now you have admitted that you could not contact the members of region 6.  Can you not tell me where the files are?  And you said that you did not know that the files were of import but you give a three page long or two page long explanation that you cannot tell them your story what projects were internal or what projects were external because you do not know where the files are.  So you are saying that it is not important?\"\n\t\t\"No, the files are important.  You may have understood me incorrectly.\"\nAnd then Mr McNally takes over -\n\"Let us deal with it on the basis of the difference of the evidence here today and the evidence in this affidavit.  Do you agree that there is a difference between what you are saying here, namely that you could not find the files because you could not get into contact with the persons from Region 6, although today you are saying that Region 6 files were not even with the Region 6 people.\"  \"The approach is that the people could know, it can be obvious that someone within a region knows of the files or it may be that he does not know of them.  Within an emergency plan it is hidden somewhere that I do not know of.  I therefore feel that it would be obvious if to enquire from anyone who is involved with the CCB.  It can be with someone who does not usually deals with it, but I specifically do not have the exact particulars with regard to where the files are being kept.\"\n\t\t\"What is your suspicion?\"\n\t\t\"At this moment I do not have any suspicions.\"\n\tI want to take that with something else that was asked of you by the Chairman in relation to this before asking you to comment.  If you would just bear with me, I just want ... Can we please go to page 1589, I'll read the portion which you have repeated here.  On a number of occasions you complained -\n\"It is not normal to lock up a Regional Manager under Section 29.\"\nAnd then the Judge says -\n\"No, but I think one has to keep a little perspective here because we are losing perspective.  You activated the emergency plan in the middle of January because you were afraid that there would be a Commission of Inquiry.\"\n\t\t\"That is correct.\"\n\t\t\"This has nothing to do with you being locked up, that had taken place much later?\"\n\t\t\"It made my control at that point much more difficult.\"\n\t\t\"But to give that answer every time gives a false perspective to events, and the complaint or the allegations about it you always knew.  The whole thing had its origin with the death of Dr Webster, and this led to that it was found that there was a bomb explosion.  Is that not so?\"\nAnd so it goes on.\n\"So therefore I do not know who you should blame for the fact that such allegations or accusations were made.\"\n\tThen I want to page 1590, the middle of the page.  Chairperson -\n\"But there is a very simple answer to what you are putting, and let us call it the Omar project.  All the persons whose identities could be disclosed with regard to the Omar project has already been disclosed, not so?  Is that correct?\"\n\t\t\"I do not want to speculate about that now.\"\nI stop there and ask you, did you know that Slang van Zyl had already given evidence before you, and that his evidence was published?  It became well-known, did you know that?",

Is that correct?\"\n\t\t\"No, I do not know whether that is correct.\"\nNow you see - anyway I won't comment at this stage.\n\"So you don't know of anyone else that was contaminated by Omar?\"\n\t\t\"No, from the top of my head I am not able to say.\"\n\t\t\"Now you say that with regard to Omar it was just purely monitoring, correct?\"\n\t\t\"Yes, that is correct.\"\n\t\t\"Other people say that that was an attempt to murder him.
