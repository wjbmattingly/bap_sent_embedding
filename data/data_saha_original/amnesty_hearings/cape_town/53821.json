            "During November 1985, I was busy with seconded service at the Unrest Unit in Worcester.  At that time I was stationed at the Uniform Branch of the South African Police in Ceres.   As I have understood the position at that time, the ANC and its alliance were involved in the liberation struggle and a campaign in Worcester to make this town ungovernable.  Unrest which led to stoning and damaging of property and even loss of life, was prevalent.  Because the Police Force in Worcester could not contain this unrest all by themselves, I myself and a few colleagues from the nearby towns, were on seconded service to the Unrest Unit in Worcester.   Our task was to suppress the political upheaval, especially in Zweletemba in Worcester and if possible to arrest some of the people involved.  The people who were involved in this political unrest were either members or supporters of the ANC, UDF who were in a political struggle against the State.   We were deployed to combat this struggle and to prevent this.\n\tAt approximately 20H30 on the 3rd of November 1985, I together with Cons Chris Geldenhuys from the Uniform Branch in Ceres who was with me on seconded service at the Unrest Unit at Worcester, we were placed there by David Vincent Frost.  At that time he was also from the Uniform Branch in Worcester.  Apart from us, there were also other members from the Force, and our instruction was to deploy in Zweletemba and any unrest which occurred, had to be suppressed, and any people who were involved in these unrests, had to be arrested.  Cons Geldenhuys and myself carried our service pistols and also shotguns.   I can remember that one of these shotguns was a certain type of shotgun and the other was a semi-automatic shotgun.   Ammunition was also issued to us for these shotguns and included SSG and other cartridges.   \n\tCons Geldenhuys and myself were busy in Zweletemba and we used a patrol van from the Unrest Unit.  While we were moving around in Zweletemba, roundabout 20H40, we were informed by radio of people stoning the community hall in Zweletemba.  Because we could not drive with the vehicle to there because of the stone throwing, we left the vehicle and went there on foot.  When we arrived there, a Constable of the previous Administration Board told us that this hall was being stoned and a few window panes had already been broken.   Round the hall and in the hall, there were many stones laying around.  Shortly after that, I noticed that a group of people from behind a fence on the opposite side of the road, were coming from there and were throwing stones at this hall.  People were about 30 paces from the hall.  \n\tAfter the people stoned the hall, they moved back to behind this fence again.  Afterwards Cons Geldenhuys and myself took up positions on a stoep at the back side of the hall, to prevent the hall from being further damaged and to prevent that the hall would be arsoned.   When these people came to the fore again, and started stoning this hall, I shot a warning shot with my shotgun to the left side of the group of people who were standing there.  It had no noticeable effect on these people and they kept on throwing these stones.   Afterwards I fired a shot on the person whom I identified as the leader of the group.   Almost simultaneously with the shot which I fired, Cons Geldenhuys also shot at these people.  Later on he told me that he was firing in the direction of the same person as I was doing.  \n\tJust after we had shot at this person, he bent forward and I thought that he was busy to pick up a stone.   Then he turned around and ran back to the fence like the rest of the group did.  The person whom I was shooting at, was wearing a  light green T-shirt with a grey trousers.  I have to mention that my shotgun and that of Cons Geldenhuys was using SSG shotgun cartridges at that stage, because we were in an area from where there were being shot on the police.  We would have used the shotguns to protect ourselves.  \n\tEarlier that evening, shots were fired at police officers in Zweletemba.  Cons Geldenhuys and myself then moved in the direction to where this group of people had disappeared, to see whether we had not hit any of these people, and then we would have been able to arrest them.   Because according to us, they were involved in the offences of public violence or the malicious damage of property.   We could not see anybody and we stayed behind a fence in Tusa Avenue to do surveillance.  After half an hour a vehicle passed in Tusa Avenue and blew its horn.  That same vehicle repeated this movement and then stopped.  Somebody who was moaning and who was probably hurt, was then carried to this vehicle from a house, and the vehicle then left.   \n\tCons Geldenhuys and myself then returned to the charge office in Zweletemba and asked that the members had to be notified by radio that they should be on - see whether they could find this specific vehicle.  Lt Frost then accompanied us to this community hall and he was an officer on service, to see what was happening.  We explained to him there what had happened.  At that stage, there was not any unrest in the vicinity of this town hall.   After we had indicated to Lt Frost what had happened there, it was about 23H00.   \n\tLater that night, Cons Geldenhuys and myself returned with our vehicle to Tusa Avenue, where we were surveying earlier.  We left the vehicle just there.  Then we moved among these houses to see whether we could not possibly find any people of this group.  Behind one of these houses there was a shack where a light was burning.  I went nearer and I looked through either the door or the window, I cannot remember exactly what the position was, I saw that a person with a light green T-shirt was laying on a mattress on the floor of this hut.   I recognised this person as the person at whom I had shot earlier that evening, and I entered this little shack.  I saw that this person had blood on one of his shoulders, I think it was the right shoulder.  I asked the person what was wrong with him and he answered me that the police had shot him earlier that evening.  He did not answer on my question, where or when it did happen.  \n\tApart from that person, I am sorry, there was another woman or two women in the shack and they were laying on a bed.   I then told this person that I was arresting him on a charge of public violence and asked him to accompany me.   He put on his shoes and stood up.   I took him, I took hold of his left arm and at that stage it did not seem to me as if he was seriously injured.   I accompanied the person outside, when I came to the door, Cons Geldenhuys said that he wanted to see whether there were not other people hidden in this little shack.   \n\tI accompanied the arrested person in the direction of the road, on the way to the patrol vehicle.  The next moment this person broke loose and ran from, through the gate of this premises in the direction of Tusa Avenue.   I followed him, I stumbled over something and later on I established it was a cement stoep and my shotgun fell from my hand.  I picked up the gun and shouted at the person that he had to stand still.  Although I cannot remember the exact words I said, it had meant that he had to stand still.  This person did not react on my warning and I realised that I would never be able to get near to him.  Here I have to mention, at that stage, I weighed about 140 kilograms and that I was 1.86 metres tall.  The deceased on the other hand, was a young man, athletically built and there was no possibility that I would be able to overtake him.   I recognised him because of the clothes he was wearing and later on, I would not have been able to identify him should he change the clothes he was wearing.  Then I followed, I shot a shot in his direction with my shotgun, to prevent that he gets away.  At that stage, when I had shot at this person, I heard him running down Tusa Lane, that was a little way from me.  Later on I established that he was about 20 paces from me in a direct line, but because he ran through the gate and moved in the left direction, he had an advantage of about 35 paces from me.  I did not shoot a warning shot before I fired at him, because there was absolutely no time for that.  After I had shot at him, I heard this person, I noticed that he had stopped running.  I ran in his direction and saw that he was seriously wounded.  He was laying on his stomach in the road.  \n\tCons Geldenhuys then went to the patrol vehicle on my request, and contacted the charge office by radio. Shortly afterwards Lt Frost appeared on the scene, they picked up the deceased and took him to the hospital.  Later on I heard that the person had died.  I was very shocked because of this incident and did not work any further that night, and stayed at the charge office.  \tThe next morning I identified the weapons to the police photographer and the person who drew the map.  During January 1987 there was a formal inquest, during which evidence was given regarding the death of the deceased, and this happened in the Magistrate's court in Worcester.  \n\tOn the advice of my legal representative, I refused to answer any questions which could incriminate me, but in a statement which I made regarding this incident, it served before this Court.  A copy of this is attached as Annexure MPL1.  As far as there are differences between this Annexure 1 and this affidavit, the information in this affidavit is true and correct and it explains things as I can remember them.   After evidence was given, this Court handed down judgement and I attach it as an annexure too.   This Court found that where somebody is killed to prevent that he escapes, you can rely on Section 49(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 51 of 1977, and if a person had to be arrested according to Annexure 1.  According to a Schedule 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 77 of 1951, at that stage did not include the offences of damage to property or public violence.  The Court decided as follows: \"This Court then has to come to the conclusion that Cons Luff could not rely on Section 49(2) to prove that it was indeed a justifiable homicide.  This conclusion makes it unnecessary for the Court to speculate further regarding any further evidence, namely the onus which the suspect has to acquit himself of, etc.  \n\tThen once again, as a result of the fact  that in any event, he cannot rely on Section 49(2), if a Court then has to decide whether the death was caused by an action or an omission which constitutes an offence on the part of anybody, then the Court comes to the conclusion of yes, on the side of Cons M.P. Luff, also see page 290 or 209 of Annexure MPL2.\"  In spite of the Magistrate's finding, the Attorney-General decided not to institute proceedings against me an during 1996, the Attorney-General however changed his mind and I was prosecuted in the Regional Court in Worcester on charges of murder in connection with this incident.  The case was postponed to the 4th of April 1997 and then a charge was put to me, to give me an opportunity to bring this application to the honourable Commission.   \n\tIt is my respectful submission that the shot fired by me at the deceased and at the community hall, as well as the shot which killed him, at Tusa Lane, was fired by me in a bona fide contemplation of furthering or rather countering the struggle waged by the liberation movements, namely the ANC and the UDF at that stage against the State.  It was my intention to resist the struggle.  There is no doubt in my mind that the deceased was a supporter of this organisation, otherwise he would certainly not have taken place in this riotous incident, and I further submit that I committed this act within the course and scope of my duties and within the course and scope of my express authority.  \n\tI further submit that I acted on the command of Lt Frost and acted to prevent a riotous assembly in Zweletemba and to arrest the persons involved in that riotous assembly and that that was the reason for my conduct, or at least that I had good reasons, and bona fide reasons to believe that I was acting within the course and scope of my duties and authority.  The fact that William Dyasi was shot dead by me in the circumstances as set out above, is something which will haunt me for the rest of my life.  As already mentioned, I was extremely shocked by the incident and the effect has developed into my married life and my relationship with my spouse and at this stage, I have virtually come to terms with this incident, it is 10 years later, and now I am being charged in terms of this incident committed by me and all these tensions have now again come to the fore.  \n\tI can only say that I am sorry that a young man had to lose his life and I beg understanding for the circumstances under which I had to operate and I offer my most sincere apologies to the family and next-of-kin of the deceased.  Signed M.P. Luff.   If the honourable Court will then please give me an opportunity, I would also like to say something to the parents.  To the parents, I would like to offer my sincere apologies for what had happened and I would like to say that I am very sorry about what had happened, and for you as parents, I ask your forgiveness for this incident.  As already mentioned, this will stay with me for the rest of my life, and it is certainly not something which is pleasant to remember.  \n\tI, myself, have a young son and I can only imagine how you must feel.   I am also prepared to speak to you personally as parents and to ask your forgiveness and to apologise, if that is what you would choose.  It does not matter what the outcome, the eventual outcome of the case, it was God's will that things happened the way they did, and I believe that he will assist you and me in the further development of this incident, and that is all, thank you.",

            "Mr Chairman, on behalf of my client, I will speak in Afrikaans.\n\tThis is a reasonably unique situation that in a certain sense, there is only one person who can testify about what had happened regarding the specific death of William Dyasi, and that is the applicant appearing before the Committee.  \n\tRegarding the merits of the case, it is my respectful submission that his version as provided to the Committee, is the true and correct version of what had happened.   This is corroborated by the only real evidence which is available, in this case as my client testified and also said, you have a certain acceptance of a father and mother being here today, and the father acknowledged that that was a very tumultuous evening, he was very shocked and his part of the testimony which may be relevant, can be regarded or should be regarded in that light.   \n\tIt is my submission that my client, Mr Luff, was specifically allocated to combat riots.  Riots which in 1985 consisted of political groupings who was in insurrection against the system of apartheid and what had happened on the 3rd of November was a direct consequence of that.  The only reason why Mr Luff became involved was because of these Riot Unit or combating these riots which the police had to do on a large scale.  This was the reason why they were at that community hall on that specific evening.   \tTheir activities there was once again only based on Mr Luff's evidence and he said that they were attacked by a group of people, that he and his colleague fired some shots in the direction of this group and according to them, it seemed or it appeared that somebody had been hit.   \n\tMr Chairman, I wish to present to the Committee the fact that this was a deed committed in a political context and this falls within the context of Subsection (3) of the relevant Act.  Mr Luff acted in the course and scope of his duty.  This is Section 20, subsection (b).  \n\tAfter this incident, and I request the Committee that you must please accept Mr Luff's version as the truth, and when they found the deceased later on in the house, they took the deceased outside, the deceased started to run, Mr Luff followed him and when - Mr Luff fell and when he got up, he shot the fatal shot.  \tThe reason why he is appearing here is because he did not act correctly.  We can accept that and you can expect that he should have had better judgement under those circumstances.  It could have been an offence.  He is asking for forgiveness, he is applying for amnesty and I ask the Commission to accept his version as the true version and that he has made a full disclosure of all the relevant facts.   \n\tAnd furthermore that the firing of the second shot, just as the action at the hall was the result of a political situation which existed during 1985, and that he acted as an employee of the South African Police Service.   \n\tMr Chairman, without repeating myself I want to emphasise that only Mr Luff or Mr Luff's evidence regarding the first incident and the second incident, has been given under oath, because he is the only person who can testify and I request the Committee to accept that as the true version.  I don't know whether there are any other issues you want to address me on.",

            "Thank you honourable Chairperson.\n\tHonourable Chairperson, it is my respectful submission that the applicant has not complied with the basic requirements of the Act in terms of having made a full disclosure to us, or that his act was politically motivated.   \n\tHonourable Chairperson, my respectful submission that the evidence that we have heard right from the identification of the deceased as the leader of the group that had apparently been stoning the hall to the very final allegation of him having managed to escape and under those circumstances having been shot and killed by the applicant, it is my respectful submission that we have not heard the truth from the applicant in that respect.   \n\tThe applicant has stated that, on one hand he states that he identified the deceased as the leader of the group and on the other hand, he says that he shot in that specific direction merely because the bulk of the group was standing there.   \n\tFurthermore, if one looks at the testimony of the father, Mr Dyasi, who states that his purpose in sending William out that evening was in fact to collect his youngest daughter.  The circumstances under which he was shot, was in fact relayed to his father in as much as my learned colleague has stated that that is hearsay evidence, it is my respectful submission that it is in fact admissible as one of the exceptions to the hearsay evidence rule, that it is a statement made by a dying person.   \n\tIn that regard, you are entitled to take judicial cognisance of it.   \n\tFurthermore, we look at the evidence of Mr Dyasi in respect of the physical condition of the deceased, that his son was not in a position to stand up even, he was so badly injured and that he made in his statement, way back in 1985 to the police as well.   \n\tClearly it does not accord with the conditions or the circumstances that Mr Luff would have us believe that he removed the deceased from the premises.  Mr Luff's credibility is also subject to concern, especially if one looks at the question of him having observed that street for some 45 minutes and a possible perpetrator of the stone throwing incident was then removed from the scene, and Mr Luff does nothing about it except later goes down to the police station.  \n\tHere is an ideal opportunity for them to have at least arrested some of the people whom they are saying they went out there to look for, otherwise what is the purpose of the observation?  He would have us believe that he was afraid whereas he had in fact had seven years' experience by then in as much as he may have only been working in unrest areas for five months prior to that, it doesn't change the fact of his seven years experience.   \n\tMy submission is that his explanation in this regard is rather incredible.   And also that the police station was just down the road, he could have called for assistance and there was no follow up to that observation at all, subsequent to his reporting the matter.  \n\tI will also ask you to take into consideration Mr Luff's version about, or his explanation for why in fact he shot William.  He didn't fire a warning shot, he didn't call, Mr Geldenhuys was in the immediate vicinity, for help.  He shot him with an SSG round which is clearly lethal, he knew the impact of, he knew the effects of him having firing that shot, that Mr Dyasi could in fact have been killed by that.   It does not accord with his version to us, that he had intended merely to arrest the deceased.   \n\tThen furthermore he seeks to rely on Section 20(b) of the Act, which expects, sorry not expects, according to which Mr Luff ought to have acted both in the course and scope of his duties or under express or implied authority.  \n\tThe evidence by his Commanding Officer, Lt Frost, at the inquest was clear that he had to act with the minimum amount of force and in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act.  Neither of that was done.  \n\tFurthermore if one looks at Mr Luff's political motivation for having committed the offence, if one looks at the one requirement of proportionality, it is - it wasn't necessary for William to be killed in order for the overall political objective as Mr Luff would have us believe, to be achieved.  He had help, they could have arrested him and the normal process could have taken its course.  There is no evidence before us that had Mr Dyasi been arrested, that the normal judicial processes could not have run its proper course at the time.  \n\tAlso I will ask you to take into consideration that Mr Luff has conceded that regardless of what the allegations against Mr Dyasi was at the time that he was arrested, he would still have acted in the way that he did, by shooting him.   Also his explanation about them not being able to subsequently identify the victim had he escaped, is clearly laughable, the man was severely injured.  By all counts, he wasn't even able to walk on his own.   Mr Luff was a healthy, tall, strong policeman at the time with seven years' experience.   \n\tMy respectful submission is that having taken all this into consideration, that there was no political motive for this killing and that we haven't heard the truth here today, honourable Chairperson.  Those are my submissions, if there are any further points you would like to hear me on.",

            "Mr Chairman, just on one or two legal aspects.\n\tMy learned colleague concluded by saying that Mr Luff did not have a political motive at that stage when the deed was committed.  It is my respectful submission that the objective or the requirement according to the Act is not a political motive, but a political objective ... (transcriber's own translation) ...   The motive of the person committing the deed is only one of six factors to be taken into consideration by the Commission to determine whether a political motive or whether the criteria for a political motive have been complied with.   \n\tIt is my respectful submission that the fact that Constables and Sergeants, policemen in uniform in 1985 went into townships with shotguns to protect State property and to break up crowds of people involved in riots, and that was all part of a political objective of the previous dispensation.  \n\tMr Luff is a person who played a very small role in that political objective.  Therefore I am asking the Committee like - as the Act describes it regarding a political objective in that regard and I am referring to the criteria in subsection 3 of Section 20, and specifically (b), and I don't think it is necessary to read this out, or to repeat it.  \n\tI wish to add that when my learned colleague indicated subsection 2 of Section 20, it does not only have to do with expressed powers, but also to tacit powers.
