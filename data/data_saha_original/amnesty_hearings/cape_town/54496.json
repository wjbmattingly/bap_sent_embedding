I went to reconnoitre the address, I observed the layout of the house, I wanted to see if there were any vehicles there.  There was a block of flats near the house and if one went via the flats, one could view directly the situation of the house.  I saw a yellow Ford Escort vehicle with the old Port Elizabeth registration number.  I took the number down and at a certain point, subsequently I gave this information to Lafras Luitingh.\n\tThere was no further task which was assigned to me in this regard, and I kept myself busy with the Webster case.",

            "I didn't want to speak the truth with regard to any of the projects in which I had been involved.  It was clear to me that I functioned in a completely different way and that I was also handled as such by the CCB.  Because I have had liaison with Calla Botha and Slang van Zyl, they told me on a regular basis what was going on in their cell structure, what the pro forma was according to the formulation of matters, and it was a very rigid system.\n\tMy experience, however, was different.  If I were to make amnesty applications with regard to this, it would mean that I would be turning against those in the system, such as Joe Verster and others, and I wouldn't have any backup.  I would be standing completely alone, if they came to testify and they testified against me.  All they would really have to do is to deny everything, and then I would be in hot water, left all by myself.\n\tSo I told lies to the Harms Commission and I lied during the post mortem inquest into the death of David Webster and at a certain stage, Joe Verster, after the appointment of the Harms Commission, sent a message to me via Lafras Luitingh and Luitingh told me that Joe had said that my attitude had to be tested, and that if my attitude appeared to be suitable, Joe Verster would request a meeting with me.\n\tMy attitude was favourable, I decided to speak to him, and we had a meeting a few days later in the Braamfontein Protea Hotel.  Upon my arrival in the hotel, it was only Mr Verster who was in the particular room number which was given to me.  We spoke for a while.  He asked me, I could see that he was uncomfortable, perhaps he thought that I was bugging him or that he was bugging me.  Things weren't that easy, but ultimately the discussion boiled down to Mr Verster asking me how much detail the South African Police had available, during my interrogation, how much they knew about the CCB, the activities of the CCB, what was already disclosed, what I had disclosed.\n\tI made certain admissions to him in this regard, which were correct, according to my summation of it.  Then Mr Verster said to me, he called me closer, because we stood some distance away from each other in the room, he called me closer and turned up the volume of the television in the room, he took a document out of his briefcase, he called me over and indicated to me with his finger on the document, without speaking.  I read the document, but I cannot recall specifically whether it was an affidavit, but I suspect according to my recollection, that it had to do with a document that Mr Verster would present to the Harms Commission and the passage that he pointed out to me was about his denial of any involvement or knowledge with regard to the Webster incident.  I nodded my head and then he said to me, that is my attitude, and then I left subsequently.",

            "Yes, that is correct.  I consistently denied that I had any knowledge of or involvement in the Webster incident.  I had a tactic of distance, which started when I was locked up under Section 29.  I was a former policeman and detective and I had investigated serious crimes.  I realised when the interrogation was underway, while I was in isolation under Section 29, that I would have to distance myself from the CCB as far as I possibly could.\n\tAs things went by, I gave what I thought was a credible explanation which was of course, a fabrication, and what I said was that the CCB had made use of my services, but that during the Webster incident, I was no longer a member of the CCB, I used the problems with McQuillan and the incident to which has been referred, which took place at the Sandton Security Branch with Col Viktor and I conveyed this to the Investigating Team, in order to distance myself from the CCB.  It was the most logical step for me, it suited me.\n\tAt a certain stage, as things developed into the future, it also suited the CCB that I had distanced myself from them, but that technique of distancing myself, no longer suits me today, because it was also not the truth.",

            "Chairperson, I met Mr Slang van Zyl some time before the Omar incident, during the same year, I would say it was in the beginning of 1989 when I met him at the Witwatersrand Police Rugby Club.\n\tAt a certain stage I contacted him upon numerous occasions, we had telephonic conversations, ultimately we met in a restaurant if I recall correctly.  It wasn't clear to him, but from the discussion we realised that both of us were working for the CCB.  I also told him that I was working for them, and I told him that sometimes I would receive information which was favourable information and what basically happened, we decided to assist each other when we could.\n\tThen it happened at a certain stage that Mr van Zyl requested me, and I don't know if this was his evidence, I think his evidence was that I approached him, but he approached me with regard to the Omar incident.  I cannot recall where I saw him, but we discussed it and he told me that such a project had been registered, and it had been approved as a CCB project on the highest level, and that Adv Dullah Omar had to be assassinated.\n\tAt this point he also informed me that the persons who had already been tasked, had been provided with a Makarov pistol, fitted with a silencer and that the project had been pending for quite some time and that there had been problems in executing the problems and he wanted to know if I would be prepared to assist with the project.\n\tI was never asked to monitor Dullah Omar, as has been the evidence here by Mr van Zyl.  I was requested to go and kill Dullah Omar because the other persons had proven ineffective.\n\tArrangements were made between me and Mr van Zyl and I flew down to Cape Town, and booked in at the Inn on the Square.  Shortly afterwards Mr van Zyl joined me in Cape Town, he briefed me further.  A meeting took place with the coloured gang member, one Peaches Gordon.  I think it was at the Cape Sun Hotel or some place nearby, it was in the evening.  \n\tPeaches Gordon departed after we had the discussion and he returned and in my presence he handed over a firearm to Slang van Zyl, a Makarov pistol with a silencer which he removed from a box.  Slang van Zyl gave the Makarov and the silencer to me, I hid it in the ceiling of my hotel room.  There was a later rendezvous later that night, or at least, it was the following day, I beg your pardon, the following day.  There was another meeting between me, Gordon and van Zyl.\n\tPeaches Gordon was instructed by van Zyl to take us to the residence of Adv Omar, which he did.  He took us and identified a residence in Athlone to us.  We were four persons, another person drove, a coloured person who was unknown to me, he was never introduced to me, then it was Slang van Zyl, me and Peaches Gordon.    From that point onwards, I would be tasked with the murder of Adv Omar.\n\tI established my own liaison with Peaches Gordon and asked him to steal a vehicle for me which I could use for the incident.  I paid him R500-00.  He undertook to have the vehicle available by the following day.  The following morning, at approximately 10 o'clock, I rendezvoused with him a few blocks away from the hotel, in a parking area.  He identified a vehicle to me, it was a Nissan product, cream coloured.  \n\tI gave him the R500-00 for the vehicle, but I first inspected the vehicle.  It had an original key.  When I climbed into the vehicle, I saw that the vehicle only had 2 600 kilometres on the speedometer.  It smelt new on the inside.  I saw that the speakers and the radio of the vehicle had been removed, which then necessitated me to ask Peaches Gordon where he had obtained the vehicle from.  He told me that he and somebody else had taken the vehicle from a garage which sold vehicles, they took the vehicle on a test drive and kicked the driver of the vehicle out under way.\n\tThis didn't suit me for two reasons.  Firstly I knew how the police surveillance system functioned, this was a hot vehicle, it wasn't a regular vehicle, because it was a stolen vehicle, and also because it was brand new and it would be easily identified.  However, I took the vehicle from him and gave him the money and left him to go.\n\tLater that afternoon, I took the same vehicle to  Cape Town airport, I entered the airport parking area with that vehicle and parked it.  I did this so that I could get the exit ticket for the vehicle, hung around there for a while until I found a suitable vehicle, I stole a Ford station wagon with a roof-carrier.  It was in a reasonably good condition.  I stole this from the parking area in the airport and departed back.  I had done prior reconnaissance and I used a block of flats approximately one and a half kilometres away from the hotel where I was staying, because there were vehicles moving in and out day and night, I parked the vehicle there.\n\tOnce again I contacted Peaches Gordon.  After I had obtained a vehicle which was similar to the vehicle in my movements, I found another vehicle of the same colour and the same fabrication and took the registration number and wrote it down.  I found Peaches Gordon and when he arrived at me, I asked him to have a set of number plates made according to the number that I had given him.  for this I gave him R300-00.  He had them made and gave them to me.\n\tI went and equipped the vehicle that I had stolen from the airport with the plates that I had ordered.  Then the vehicle was operationally prepared.  All of this took place during the first excursion to Adv Omar in the Cape.  It was during July 1989.  \n\tI had consistent contact with Mr van Zyl via the telephone, I gave him reports of progress and so forth.   When I commenced physically, I drove to the premises.   The first journey before it became dark, was during the afternoon.  I conducted a thorough reconnaissance of the area and examined the area for possible escape routes, I checked to see what the situation would be with regard to traffic, with regard to light and when I say light, I mean traffic lights and the possibility for traffic jams and so forth.\n\tDue to the location of the premises, and the movement around the premises, this was not something which could be performed during the morning or during the day.   It would have to take place after hours when it was dark and after peak hour traffic had subsided because in the morning one would have the situation, I thought that the morning would have been a suitable option, because anybody that is a professional person such as Adv Omar would have to go to the office, so if I monitored him in the morning, I could see he would leave home at quarter past seven or whatever the case may be, but the traffic discouraged me completely.\n\tThere was a high level of visibility in the area, and if you drove in that area in the morning, it was bumper to bumper traffic, which did not prove conducive to an escape route.  That is why I knew that it would have to take place during the evening, after peak hour traffic.  I told this to Slang van Zyl and continued with the project.  During the first excursion to the Omar residence, and I am referring to the first times that I was in the Cape, but I visited the place several times.   During all these times, I did not visually observe Mr Omar.\n\tI had problems from the very first day with my observation in the area.  It was a predominantly coloured, Malay or Indian neighbourhood.  The people in the environment would pick up rather quickly if there was a vehicle or a person who didn't belong there.  Perhaps I could explain as follows because I experienced this in the police quite often.  It was an area which had its own rhythm and pulse.  Anybody who didn't belong in that area, would stick out like  sore thumb.  \n\tPeople in the neighbourhood would pick it up very quickly, and I had the problem that I was going with a vehicle which was stolen and fitted with false number plates, with ten litres of petrol on the back seat with which I would burn the vehicle after I had left the scene of the murder.  I was also in possession of a Makarov with a silencer.\n\tIf you put the Makarov and the silencer together, it was about this long, it would hang some distance above my ankles.",

            "I would say the silencer was approximately 25 centimetres in length and the firearm would also be somewhat shorter than 25 centimetres.\n\tThe other problem which I experienced would be that I would be there at approximately dusk, observing the house and people would become restless, they would pass the vehicle, look into the vehicle.  Upon one or two occasions I asked people for directions, I obtained the names of certain surrounding streets from a map that I bought at the CNA, I would ask them \"where is this street\" or \"where is that street\" and then they would give me directions and then I would park the vehicle in a different place.\n\tBut I also had the problem in that I could not abandon the vehicle, because if I disembarked from the vehicle, I would stand out even more as a white person in this area.  It was a nightmare with regard to these details, and I reported this to Mr van Zyl.   I left Cape Town with unfinished business because I had not had a visual observation of Mr Omar and I had experienced all these problems.  I told Mr van Zyl that the CCB should pin-point information specifically oriented information regarding where Mr Omar would be attending a meeting for example, or making a speech. \n\tIf he would be going somewhere, where he would have to leave home after the regular working hours, in other words, when it was already dark.  He undertook to see what he could do in this regard, because I was told that there was a system of persons who could provide information about Mr Omar's movements and so forth.  That is why I made the request to him.\n\tIt didn't happen that way.  I returned to Johannesburg.  We had a few more meetings there, but I cannot recall them specifically.  Mr van Zyl contacted me upon a second occasion, it was in August 1989 and he told me that there was serious pressure from very high levels for the project to be executed.   There were also discussions, but I cannot recall specifically when,  and I made enquiries as to why he was such a big problem.  I knew who Adv Omar was, and I would imagine that at a certain stage while I was in the Cape, the Tony Yengeni trial was underway and I read in the papers that Adv Omar was involved in it in some or other way.\n\tBut I was told that documents had been obtained by means of a burglary and that in these documents, there was evidence or information which indicated that Adv Omar would be involved in underground structures, and that he was also involved in some or other bombing campaign which was waged in Cape Town.  Those were the reasons that they provided.  But there was tremendous pressure, and it was decided that I would undertake two excursions to Cape Town, which I did.  I came to Cape Town for a second time.  Once again I booked into the Inn on the Square, I regained the weapon, the vehicle was exactly where I had left it.  I had also left the firearm here and managed to get the firearm again.  I repeated the same process and experienced even more problems than before with regard to remaining inert and being observed.\n\tI could not conduct the operation in such a way.  For a number of days I did not have a visual observation of Mr Omar, I expressed my frustration and said that to continue working like this, would be like taking a game of Russian Roulette with a vehicle because there was always the chance that someone would phone the police.\n\tI would be sitting in front of the house, and they would send someone out to come and check the post-box at nine o'clock at night.  I didn't belong there.  People could easily see that there was a problem.  The SAP could apprehend me for possession of the stolen firearm and a stolen vehicle.  These were the problems that I had, and I expressed these problems to Mr van Zyl.  He tried all the time to get different information, but the information that I had all the time was that Adv Omar was very active, that he moved around a lot and that he was at home.\n\tThis didn't really help me much, because it would still mean that I would have to hang around there to see when he would be there, and I couldn't do this in the day, I had to do it in the night when it was dark. \n\tOnce again I returned with unfinished business to Johannesburg.  I was very frustrated. \n\tThen there was a third excursion which was planned for August 1989.  It was September, September 1989.    I flew down for the third time to Cape Town and once again, I met with Mr van Zyl.  It was again conveyed to me that this project had reached a critical stage and that everything in our power had to be done to kill Mr Omar.\n\tOnce again I obtained the vehicle and the firearm which amazingly had remained in the same place.  I began to act in the same manner as before.  At a certain stage, it was the last evening or time, but I didn't know it at that point, I had a visual observation of Mr Omar, only once throughout this entire time, and I will refer to it now.\n\tI climbed out of the vehicle, it was after hours, I went to the premises.  I waited near Adv Omar's vehicle.  I entered the premises for the second time, and I saw Adv Omar approaching.  I had spent approximately an hour and a quarter on the premises, I had a balaclava on my head and I had the firearm in my hand.  It was cocked and ready to fire.\n\tAdv Omar came out and approached the vehicle, but he was accompanied by a female person, so I didn't shoot him.  The order to me was to make it appear like a crime, it had to look like a robbery.  If I shot him, I would have to clean out his pockets, if he had a wallet, or a watch or any such items, I should take them, it should look like a robbery.  That was the instruction from the beginning.\n\tThere was a woman with Adv Omar and I decided, based upon that, to withdraw.  I climbed out of the vehicle.   They climbed out of the vehicle as I saw them, I am sorry, I was confused because Brenda's evidence was different.  In effect they disembarked from the vehicle and entered the house.  I did not shoot them, I withdrew, I was not seen by them.\n\tThat very same evening I made the telephonic report to Slang van Zyl that I had a visual of Adv Omar, but that  - I didn't give him any details over the phone, I decided that we would rendezvous the following day.  He asked me why I didn't shoot Adv Omar and I explained that the circumstances were not favourable and that I would tell him all about it the following day.\n\tI think he was in Cape Town on leave.  At that stage I was staying in the Woodstock Holiday Inn.  If I recall correctly, it was at the same time that Adv Anton Lubowski was shot dead because I had the number of a holiday flat where I contacted Slang van Zyl.  I phoned him early that morning because throughout the night, I had visited night-clubs and I walked in, switched on the TV and on the six o'clock news I saw that Anton Lubowski had been assassinated in South-West Africa.  I phoned Slang van Zyl and told him to switch on his television and I told him that Lubowski had fallen in South-West.\n\tHe undertook to come and see me later that morning, which he did.  I think it was approximately ten or eleven o'clock.  During the course of the morning, he came to my hotel to speak to me.  We discussed the Lubowski incident and speculated on who had been involved in it.\n\tUpon this occasion Mr van Zyl discussed the Cape Town bomb with me.  He asked me about the other matters as well, but he first discussed the bomb attack.   He told me that the bomb which had gone off in Athlone, had been his project and that the project was aimed at killing those who would have been responsible for a bomb campaign in Cape  Town.  It was aimed at killing those who had been in the meeting, that he had attached four kilograms of nails to the bomb with masking tape so as to product a greater shrapnel effect, that the project had not been correctly executed, because the remote control mechanism was faulty.  He explained upon my questions that it didn't want to detonate, and that he had tried to fix it and that eventually when everybody had left the meeting, the bomb did explode and that some people sustained light injuries, but that it was their lucky day, because all of them should have sailed, which meant that all of them should actually have died.\n\tI discussed the matter with him, and directly afterwards we discussed Adv Omar.  I explained to van Zyl that Adv Omar had arrived home, but that there were unforeseen circumstances, that he was accompanied by a female person.  I decided not to shoot him.  He nearly went mad.  He wanted to know why I hadn't shot him.  He said that I had lost my chance.  I told him that he had wanted it to look like a robbery, upon which he retorted that I should have killed the woman as well.  I told him that I wasn't prepared to do this, and I was upset.  After having shot Dr Webster and having seen that there was a lady with him at that time, I cannot say that I wouldn't have shot him, because there was pressure on me to perform the operation, but I was upset about it afterwards.\n\tI knew that if I had shot Adv Omar there and if I hadn't shot the woman, I would have been observed upon my escape, I wouldn't have reached the highway before being apprehended.\n\tI told him that I wasn't prepared to do things like this, and that I wouldn't do things like this, based upon which we had an altercation and he told me that he wasn't very satisfied with it, and I told him that I wasn't prepared to continue on this basis and to execute the project as such, unless there was precise pin-point information regarding Adv Omar's whereabouts, be it a UWC meeting or anything else.  That is when I withdrew myself from the Omar incident.",

            "Mr Chairperson, yes, it was during one of these excursions, I think it was the second time that I went to Cape Town, it was in August 1989.  As I have said, I booked in at the Inn on the Square, and Mr Slang van Zyl contacted me one evening and he arrived at the hotel.  He was also booked into the same hotel, I think.\n\tHe told me that he was there for official business for the CCB.  It had nothing to do with the Omar incident.  It was about Bishop Tutu and that an item had to be placed at the Bishop's house and he asked me if I wanted to accompany him.\n\tDuring the discussion that we had, Mr van Zyl told me that it would be a foetus of a baboon.  He brought it with him on the plane.  We made a few jokes concerning this.   I asked him \"what is this about\" and he said he received an instruction to go and hang this thing up, and he wanted to know, I asked him did he know where the house was, and he said \"yes\".\n\tHe said we had to be very careful, there were two guards, and they could be armed.  From there, we went to his room and he had a flask, it was placed in a bag and he showed me the baboon.  I said it was a very ugly thing, but I used harsh words to explain that.\n\tI said \"yes, they are going to identify us with this baboon, because it looks like the Head of the Defence Force\" and that was the only jokes that we made.  It was in bad taste, but it was the only jokes that we made.\n\tThen I told him \"listen, I cannot understand why we must do this, that we must go through this risk, possible shooting, that there could be guards injured or killed, for something that seems to be mischief.\"  He said \"no, it is actually a very serious project\".  Then Mr van Zyl gave me a layout of a five step plan that was formulated by the CCB concerning this project on Bishop Tutu.\n\tIt was described as follows:  the project consisted of five phases.  This would be phase three, the next phase would be the hanging up of a hyena, probably at Bishop Tutu's house again.  He was not involved in the first two phases, and he was also not involved in the next phase, the fifth phase.  It would be to poison Trevor Tutu, his son, with some poison from a witch-doctor.  He told me there was some unit from the CCB that had access to Tutu junior's food by means of people who were tasked, who worked on a servant and had access to the house.  I have no details concerning this.  That would be the five phase plan.\n\tIt did not really make sense that we would do something like that, but I realised that this was indeed serious business.\n\tWe met Peaches Gordon and another coloured man later that evening.  My experience was that it was approximately after twelve that evening.  We went to the Tutu house.  Mr van Zyl indicated where we should go, up to the house of Bishop Tutu.  It was a large estate.  There were lights outside and there were also lights in the house.\n\tAt one part, the top part of the estate, we climbed over the fence.  I climbed over first and I stood on the inside.  Mr van Zyl climbed over and then there was Peaches Gordon, the three of us.  With us we had the flask with the baboon that Mr van Zyl took from me, when he climbed over.  We had six nails, six inches long, that according to Mr van Zyl's presentation would have been treated in some way, that it would have a witch-doctor connotation.  Bishop Tutu would then understand, if he found these things, it would have a specific meaning from the witch-doctor's beliefs of his tribe.\n\tThese specific nails had to be placed on either side of a pathway or a driveway that was used by Bishop Tutu, it had to be nailed in on either side and the baboon had to be hung up on a place where he would find it.  At a later stage, after we executed a part of this project, Mr van Zyl mentioned it to me.  I think it was later that evening, or the next day, that the reason why the flask had to remain in the hessian bag was that Bishop Tutu had to see there was a strange object hanging from the tree, he had to be scared, he was not supposed to touch it.  He was then supposed to get the police to come and look, to see what this is, maybe it is an explosive device or whatever, and the reason behind this was to create a record.  There had to be a publication and there could be documentation concerning this, and Bishop Tutu can then phone the police.\n\tThere would be a charge number or he make a crimen injuria case and there must be a publication.  The Defence Force wanted to create a background and a record over a period of time, that would show that Bishop Tutu's own people were busy with him, his own tribe was busy with him.  They wanted it to appear that Bishop Tutu, because he asked for sanctions against the country, if his own people were angry at him, because of this, and that they were now busy with witch-doctor stuff because they were losing their jobs and there is no jobs created because of his actions.\n\tThis background had to be created and there had to be a record of this.  If it would then happen that Mr Trevor Tutu was killed in the way in which they planned it, and it would show to state involvement or a finger could be pointed to the Security Branch or the National Party, then all this information and this background that they created, they would then take it out, they would use the documentation and the police visits would be placed as \"look, this man's own people are busy with him\", and that is why we made a study concerning the witch-doctor poison.  It would have been herbal poison.  It all had to point back to his own people and the State could then point these things out.",

            "Yes, Mr Chairperson, I did.  In June 1989 I was approached by a person by names of Kobus le Roux.  He introduced himself to me and he said that he was also attached to the CCB and that he, it was also his real name, that he was serving in the South-West Africa district and he asked me if I could function or assist him there.\n\tI was in the establishment phase of the buying of a house, not long after I was released from prison, and I said \"no, I cannot see my way clear of going there permanently\" and he asked me if I could go there part time, or work on a part time basis.  I said \"yes\".  There were a few meetings between the two of us.  I left for South-West Africa, Namibia.  Certain arrangements were made with me, that I would book into a hotel there in Windhoek and then contact Kobus le Roux on this side and give details about where I was.\n\tEverything happened as I have just said.  He gave me a certain amount of cash, I think it was R6 000-00 or R8 0000-00.  This was to cover my costs.  I left and I did as I planned.  I went to the Continental Hotel in Windhoek and I conveyed the information to him.  He was in Pretoria.  The next day, during that evening, he arrived at my hotel room, we discussed certain matters, we had a discussion and he told me that an Adv Anton Lubowski was a priority target for the CCB and that he was authorised to deal with it, it was in his region.\n\tI got the impression that they had worked extensively on Adv Lubowski and that there were various other matters surrounding Lubowski, before I was brought into this whole situation.  He asked me if I was willing to, he first put to me that Lubowski will be killed in South-West Africa, and I assumed then he would be killed, and that he wanted to create a cut-off point.  There was a Charles Nielsen, who was a coloured man from Rehoboth, he was a long-distance taxi driver, also short distances.  He was recruited as an unconscious member by the CCB.\n\tHe wanted me to make contact with this person.  The instructions was that when I made contact with him, with Mr Nielsen, the physical address had to be checked to ensure that this is the place where he lived and slept.  I arranged a meeting with Nielsen together with Kobus le Roux.  It was, I think it was outside the Kalahari Sun, but it was a Sun Hotel, somewhere in Windhoek.  I met him there.   He had a kombi, which was his taxi, and I had a conversation with him.  Kobus le Roux handed over money.  I do not know how much it was, he gave him.\n\tI drove with him and he said he would point out a few places.  It was not long after that that I started manipulating him.  I took him to a few clubs, a few bars and at the end, we ended up at two o'clock in the morning, at Rehoboth, at his house.   There we drank a few whiskies again.  I realised that the people in the house knew him, he had keys to the house and this was his residence.\n\tI returned, he dropped me off at a certain place.  We then planned to meet up again the next day at a certain time, and a certain place.   I reported to Kobus le Roux saying that I verified this man's address.  Le Roux then handed over a video camera, he showed me how it worked.  It was quite a modern one, but one that you can, a hand-held camera, but it also had a night vision on, that you could use in the dark.\n\tHe asked me to see Nielsen again the next day, and I had to task him to observe Mr Lubowski's house in Zanderberg, with this camera.  He had to do it as often as possible, without drawing attention to him and he had to film this house from different angles.  I accepted it and I handed this camera over to Mr Nielsen with the instructions.\n\tHe already knew about Lubowski, when I spoke to him about it, and he handed over a piece of paper on which the dates and times and at the bottom it said in pen \"Mr L is a late mover and he moves alone\", which I assumed was Mr Lubowski and he then asked me to hand it over to Kobus.  He did not know him as Kobus, but I knew him as Kobus.\n\tI reported to Kobus, told him I handed over the video camera, I gave him the piece of paper with this information and he said to me \"no, Nielsen was tasked to observe Lubowski and that he had to write down the times and dates, about his movements at his house\".  Approximately a day afterwards, I again saw Nielsen.  He had the video camera on him, he handed it over to me and he said that he had made this video.\n\tI arranged for a meeting with Mr Kobus le Roux, we both looked through the tape, or looked at the tape.  There were images of Mr Lubowski's house taken from different angles.  All of it were taken in the day, or it appeared taken in the day.  It was from a standing position and also from a moving vehicle, and you could see that somebody filmed the house from a moving vehicle.\n\tKobus le Roux was very satisfied and he told me that I must now withdraw from the Lubowski case, there was other work that I had to do, and they will continue with the Lubowski incident.

            "Yes, Mr Chairperson.  Mr Slang van Zyl tasked me at a certain stage to work on Lubowski while he was in South Africa.  He would come here to address people or to attend meetings.  The CCB had information about what was on his agenda.  Mr van Zyl contacted me and I met with him in a business complex in Florida.  He told me this is the story, they need information with regards to Lubowski, who he was going to contact, what his movements are, what his vehicle is and all the information that you could get on him, while he was in South Africa.\n\tI was given the name Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town as being the first place where he would address people or would attend a dinner party.   I received cash from Lubowski and a photograph, although I knew what he looked like, while I was in South-West Africa in June.  He appeared in the newspapers at various times, and I also think I saw him on television, (indistinct) and all those people were on television on a regular basis, all on rallies where they addressed people.  He was also in the newspaper, like the Windhoek Observer, and I bought this every day just to get the feel of the place.\n\tI went to Cape Town.  This was after the second Omar excursion, I would say August or September.  It took place in the timeframe when this incident took place.  I once again booked in to a hotel, and I took a taxi to the Mount Nelson Hotel, to go and look at the physical layout of the place, to try and find out where they would have a dinner party like this.\n\tThat evening, I returned approximately half past six.  Later that evening, people arrived, they were all dressed in very formal suits and evening wear.  There was a dinner party, I could not get access to the specific unit or section of the Mount Nelson Hotel that they used, I could get very close.  I even saw Adv Lubowski, I had a visual, he was approximately three or four meters from me.  I had, he was, he had a suit and a bowtie.  I tried to get, or observe as much as I could while I was there.\n\tAt a later stage, I waited outside for the meeting to be concluded so that I could see with whom else he had made contact.  I could not move in with, to the place where they were busy with their meeting or the dinner party itself.  Lubowski came out, he was accompanied by others and they climbed into a kombi.  I cannot recall the colour, I took the registration number and I decided to follow it.  But it was not possible, because of the time of the evening.  I do not know if it went to Hout Bay or Camps Bay.\n\tI thought maybe the people would become a bit uncomfortable and I then withdrew.  I made a report to Slang, but I also had contact with him.  I think it was the next morning, when he said to me that they had information that Lubowski was flying to Johannesburg and that he was going to stay at the Johannesburg Country Club, where he was going to address people there or will attend a meeting there.  It will be in the afternoon, and it was very clear that the CCB had pin-point information or they had somebody very close to him, they knew his whole agenda, about where he was going to be.  \n\tI took an earlier flight, they even knew what flight he was on.  I took an earlier one and I landed in Johannesburg and I waited there for him.  What then happened was that I  spoke to Brenda Mills, she brought my vehicle to the airport.  I waited there and Adv Lubowski disembarked from the plane on the scheduled flight as they had told me.  I observed him, he went to one of the places where you can rent a vehicle.\n\tI don't know if it was Avis or Imperial, but one of the offices inside the airport building.  He rented a vehicle, I observed all of this.  I followed him to the parking lot outside.  He received a red BMW vehicle.  It was still the old boxed shape, it was before the dolphin shape BMW.  It was red of colour.  I took down the registration number and I followed him.  Mr Lubowski drove to the Rosebank Hotel in Johannesburg, where I physically observed him, how he checked in.  I found out his room number by phoning from a call box in the hotel lobby, after I waited a while and I asked if my friend, Lubowski, checked in.  They gave me his room number and I said \"I will go to his room number\", and I also had the room number then.  I hung around for a while and later that afternoon, I drove out to the Johannesburg Country Club.  I observed the layout of this Country Club and also to see if I could get access.  I also had to ensure or try to find out where they were going to have this function.\n\tI was in position at about five o'clock that afternoon.  The outside area is quite big, not everything was tarred.  There were a lot of trees, etc.  Lubowski arrived alone, but there were also other people moving around.  He arrived alone, he parked quite far from the front door, and he got out and started walking.  That was just after six.\n\tI then once again, as I did at the Mount Nelson, follow him.  I could not get to him.  There were once again people in formal clothes, I would stand out, I was not an invited guest.  There were a lot of security people outside, and once again I decided to sit outside and I thought if he comes out, he may go to another place.  I did not know how long it would take.  Approximately eleven o'clock that evening something strange happened.\n\tSomeone came out and climbed into Mr Lubowski's vehicle, a blond woman.   Climbed into the BMW, switched it on and drove off.  I was confused, and I wondered how I could have missed him, because he was quite a large man.  I thought to myself that I wouldn't follow her, that I would just remain there.  Approximately 10 to 15 minutes later, Adv Lubowski came out.  He was in the company of three other men.  They first stood around outside, chatting to one another.  I noted then that they moved towards a vehicle which was parked in the parking area.  It was a Rover sedan, one of the V8s.  I took down the registration number.\n\tThey remained in the car and spoke for a while, approximately 10 minutes.  All of them departed.  He went with them.  All four of them were in the vehicle.  I followed them, they drove to the Rosebank Hotel.  At the Rosebank Hotel they disembarked and entered the hotel.  I myself parked and also entered the hotel.  They were in the restaurant or the bar or the lounge, they were having cocktails in this place, these four persons together.  \tThey remained there for quite some time.\n\tI went back to the same telephone and I contacted Slang van Zyl telephonically and told him \"listen, I have surveilled this man the whole day long, I have all the information that you wanted, what am I supposed to do now\"?  In the heat of the moment we decided that Slang van Zyl would come to the hotel and that I would meet him outside the hotel.  Van Zyl arrived, in the meantime I was there by myself and no one told me to do this, but I went up to Mr Lubowski's room to see where it was situated.  \n\tI tried the door and then I came back down.  I waited for Mr van Zyl, he took approximately 40 minutes before he arrived and we spoke down in the parking area.  I said to Mr van Zyl \"look, I am ready, I have things here with me, this man is meek, he has been walking  around here in the parking area by himself as well.  It was very easy to be able to take him as an opportunity target, also at the Country Club, I could have nominated him at any time there, because he was walking around by himself in the dark.\"  Van Zyl nearly had a heart attack, he said \"no, never, there was no such order\", but I did this on the grounds that I thought that the CCB was still after him.  There was no doubt in my mind that they wanted to kill him in South-West during that excursion, and I thought \"here is the ideal opportunity, this is the sort of work that I do, why don't I just take him out\"?\n\tVan Zyl nearly had a heart attack and he said \"under no circumstances should I do anything other than my observation of Lubowski\".  That was the instruction and the instruction came from the highest level.  He also said that Staal Burger would have me for breakfast if something went wrong with this.\n\tI abided by his decision.  Just to say I had an AK47 in the car, and I had a modified bayonet which I took with me to clubs and places like that.  It was actually a murder weapon, I had it on me.  He totally discouraged me to do anything other than the monitoring and I abided by that.\n\tI conveyed all the information during a co-ordinating session between me and Mr van Zyl, I conveyed all the information to him, including the information pertaining to the movements.  I also gave him a description of Mr Lubowski as I had viewed him, a physical description.  The fact that he was a large man, that he was in shape, he was reasonably light-footed when he walked.  He looked like the kind of man who had had training.\n\tOne would look out for that kind of thing, so he was light-footed and I also described his clothing.  He was actually quite an impressive man, if one stood close to him.  If one stood close to Adv Lubowski, he was an impressive man.  I judged him to be 6\"3, 6\"4 in length.  I conveyed all this information along with all the other physical descriptions of the vehicles and the persons who were with him to van Zyl, and that was the last of my involvement there.",

            "Chairperson, if Adv Lubowski was an agent of the South African Intelligence system, then all of us on this side of the table, worked for the KGB.  He was framed subsequently and I will tell you why I say this, because I worked very closely with some people subsequently who told me that they specifically framed him.  It only came to my attention when I was at DCC.  It was something that I didn't like, although I didn't report it.\n\tIt was something that I did not approve of, the man had already been assassinated and his name was blackened afterwards.  Originally after the shooting of Adv Lubowski, I followed the story quite closely in the media and in subsequent reports, and I saw that Donald Aitchison had been arrested.  I knew immediately that it was Donald Aitchison whom I had recruited in Johannesburg.\n\tI had various discussions with Calla Botha who was my blood-brother and we speculated regarding what could have taken place there.  Then I saw at a certain stage that the Defence Force jumped out, and I think it was Magnus Malan himself, on national television and said that Adv Lubowski was a Military Intelligence informer and I simply could not believe it.\n\tExcept that it didn't make any sense to me, for us to follow this man around all over the show, and make videos of his home and his movements, the videos were made in order to kill him.  I am not saying that I was indirectly involved, I was directly involved.\n\tI think that there was also information at the disposal of the media that there was a bank account into which deposits would have been made, and all of that was false.  I didn't know it at that stage.\n\tHowever, it puzzled me and it bothered me.  Later when I was recruited by DCC and I was brought into contact with Mr Verster, we knew each other due to our joint prison sentences for murder, we were in prison together, we were friends, there was a bond between us.  After I had been working at DCC for quite a while, they introduced Mr Verster to me within my specific system where I was functioning.

I placed the bouncers there, I visited the places daily, I addressed security problems, conducted sensitive investigations, I paid off the police who had to be paid off to prevent police raids.  I identified the crooked cops, I gave them their monthly pay.  I contacted members of the City Council who might want to close these places down, therefore I was involved there on a daily and nightly basis.\n\tThe specific incident took place, I was already involved with cocaine at that stage, I and some of the prostitutes at one of the upmarket brothels in Morningside, Sandton, I already had shares in the business, 20 percent shares, I had established an office for myself there, I did my own thing from that point.   \tMr Verster was invited by me there, for the first time and a whole new world opened up to him.

That is why I recall it so specifically, because on that particular evening, he and I were chatting about work, and we were quite high and we stumbled onto the topic of Mr Lubowski.  That is when he disclosed his entire South-West involvement to me.\n\tBefore he became involved with DCC internally, he said that he and Price and a certain Clive, who I later also met at DCC, who was a former counter-intelligence spy, specifically performed work regarding Anton Lubowski.  They had tried to recruit him, but he was not recruitable.\n\tThen I said to him \"but this man was allegedly an informer\" and he said \"no, the CCB caused all the shit, and we made him an informer\".   If he was an informer, he is an informer posthumously.  That status was allocated to him posthumously.\n\tAnd then I laughed, because we agreed that after his death, he was made an informer, and then I said \"but how is that possible, because I have read things in the paper about bank accounts and what not\", and he said \"listen, if you are not an agent, we will make you one and it doesn't really matter who you are\".\n\tAt a certain stage, he mentioned to me that Mr Marina Chiavelli, the former millionaire had passed away and he said that Chiavelli was also one who was supporting the ANC and giving them money.\n\tIt was a joint National and Military Intelligence operation to break him financially.

When I went to go and see him at his offices, he told me that he was aware that I functioned in some intelligence unit, and he told me he was still finalising certain dockets  and there was an Irish person, Donald Aitchison, who he arrested and he asked me if I did not want to use him because he's got a foreign passport.  I have told Knox on a previous opportunity, I told him that I was looking for people with a foreign passport, somebody who was awake.  He knew what I was looking for.\n\tHe then told me about this Irish person, Aitchison.  I asked him what was the charges against him, and he said theft, he stole shoes from the OK Bazaars.  Then I told him \"how are you going to get this guy out\" and he said he is on bail but he can speak to the people from the OK Bazaars and they may withdraw the charges.  He then did this.  I provided him money to pay for the shoes and they apologised and then he told the manager of the OK Bazaars that Aitchison is not quite sane, he does things that he does not know about, in other words he's got a mental knock.  Then they felt sorry for him and they withdrew the case.\n\tI went to go and meet him at the Bedford Centre, under an alias.  I told, I asked him if he was willing, or I was working for a consortium, and I used that same cover.  From the second meeting, Aitchison kept on going about this Z-Squad.  Where he heard this, I do not know.  I didn't even know about the Z-Squad.\n\tLater I heard, I read in newspaper articles, I think it was the former Bureau of State Security under Jan Hendrik van der Berg, that there existed a Z-Squad and they referred to a certain unit of the CCB as the Z-Squad.  I discouraged him, but he kept on going on.  I kept on talking about the business and eventually I asked him to give me a background report about what his background consisted of.  I got that from him, and in the meantime I made contact with Calla Botha.   If I can recall correctly, he was on ice or something, or he was told to lay low.  I provided him with the background of Aitchison, how I got to meet him.  I gave him all this information, I gave him the written document of what Aitchison wrote and on this page, I told him \"give yourself any name\", I did not mean James Bond, and he called himself \"The Cleaner\".  I then gave it to Mr Botha.  Mr Botha put it into the system.  I do not know whom he gave it to.\n\tAt a later stage I made certain enquiries.  Mr Botha told me  that the people in the CCB told him that Aitchison cannot be used, and that he must not be used.  That is the last time that I heard about it.",

            "Mr Chairperson, any other, or the only contact that I had with him was when I was detained under Section 29, and the whole Terrorist Section, I was the only person detained.  At a certain stage during my detention, they confronted me with Donald Aitchison.  It was Col Jumbo Smit who confronted me.  He came in with the Investigating Officers and Jaap Joubert from the Detective Branch in South Africa, and the investigating team was involved with my interrogation.\n\tThey came into my cell and they pushed him into my cell.  I cannot recall how long I was detained by then.  I looked at him and I said \"no\", then he mentioned my name.  I think he said Andrew or something.  I then pretended not to know him, but it was not very convincing.  They locked him up in the cell with me for about two hours, but I thought maybe the cell was a bit rigged, they can, they took me out for interrogation, they can then place a bug in the cell.  The more he started talking to me, the more I denied him, and then I started swearing and then he said \"yes, he knew they were taping the conversation\".  I confronted him there, and I think he was also detained there while they did this investigation.\n\tAll the cells are soundproof, so you have no contact with anybody else.  I then saw him again after he returned back to South-West Africa Namibia, I was released after three and a half months.  When he was released from South West Africa, from prison, he came back to his girlfriend in Bedfordview and when I found out that he was released under Section 29, I did another thing that I shouldn't.  I felt sorry for him and I did not want to leave him alone.  I went to go and see him, or I went to see his girlfriend, and I assisted her financially.\n\tI encouraged her and we built up some trust between us.  I spoke to her over the phone, I went to visit her at the Bedford Centre, I took a girlfriend with me.  I gave her some money and found out what her complaints were, and I tried to do what I could for them in the system.  At a later stage he was released and then he contacted me on the number that I gave her.  I went to see him also at the Bedford Centre where we drank a cup of coffee.  We had a discussion, I asked him about the Lubowski murder and he told me, he did not want to admit to me that he murdered Lubowski, but he described others to me.  I asked him for descriptions, I wanted him to ID the people who were using us and I told him \"we were both locked up\" and the people whom he described to me, were not anybody that I could really place or that I knew or who had contact with him and sent him around.\n\tWe spoke about money that was left in a hotel room for him, in a suitcase, under a bed.  More or less the same as Chaps Maree said, it was all James Bond stories.  I got the impression that people contacted him in South-West Africa and gave him money, but the description that he gave me, did not fit in with anybody that I knew.",

What happened was, while Mr Aitchison was detained, Mr Calla Botha came to me, we had regular contact with each other, we knew we were both in contact with him, and there were problems.  He  told me that the people in his region or cell, are very worried or concerned about the meeting that took place in the Royal Ascot Hotel and that he was tasked to steal the registry.  I told him that I would assist him.\n\tWe then left.  It was not very easy, although if you want to do it the hard line way, you could go in with a weapon, but the foyer of the hotel was very busy, there were various staff members, it is quite a high counter and behind the counter, there is a very thick book.  It was covered in leather, it was the only book there, and in my work as a Detective, I visited a lot of hotels, as a Narcotics Detective.  I knew documentation like this, and I knew it looked like the register.  That was the  only thing that was laying there, and I had to move very quickly, because Mr Botha started complaining and tried to draw attention away from me.  \n\tWhile they were busy there, I grabbed the book and I walked out.  I met him outside.  We were quite satisfied with ourselves.  Once we were about two kilometres from there, I realised it was the table book, where they made reservations for tables for the restaurant.  We wanted to return and I realised there was only one way in which we could do it.  We had to burglar the hotel.  If things did not look right, we would have to do it as a stick up, and we have to take the cash as well.\n\tWhen we parked in front of the hotel, Mr Alex Kouvaris got out of a vehicle, it was a BMW, he was with a blond woman.  I knew he was a high profile person who owned a lot of night-clubs in Johannesburg, and I also knew that he had certain connections with Mr Burger.  I did not know what the connections were, however.  When I saw this, Calla told me that he is quite sure that Mr Burger targeted Mr Kouvaris to do the same thing, and we then withdrew.\n\tThen at a later stage he told me that he was told not to attempt this again.",

Mr Tjongarero was a senior member of SWAPO, as I deduced.  He lived internally, in other words he did not go into exile.\n\tThe CCB wanted to kill him in order to drive a wedge between the people of SWAPO who were returning from exile and those who remained on the inside.  They had to create conflict between the two.  That is how it was conveyed to me.\n\tAn address was given to me, it was the address of Mr Tjongarero in Katura neighbourhood.  He also gave me binoculars, quite an expensive set of binoculars.  I am not an expert in the field of binoculars, but it certainly would not have cost below R40,000 to R50,000, this was provided to me.  It also had a night vision setting.\n\tI traced the address and I found a small hill which I could use to penetrate, in other words, what I mean is that I could gain access through that without having to point a gun at a security guard, I could get to the place.  There wasn't a regular stream of people there.  From that position, I could observe the house, which I indeed did.\n\tIn my Section 29 affidavit I see that I said that the vehicle was a white Toyota Cressida.  I cannot recall independently, but I do know that it was a sedan vehicle, with a short registration number.  I saw that the vehicle left and returned to the residence quite regularly, from Katura to Windhoek.   I obtained a description of the person when he disembarked at a certain point, and sent all that information back into the system, via Kobus le Roux, who came back to me and said that the information had been confirmed, and that it was indeed the target.  There was a weapon available, and I said \"look, the job is on, I can do it any time.\"  I had driven besides Mr Tjongarero, I have been positioned right next to him at a traffic light late at night.

            "Yes Chairperson, in essence Mr le Roux said to me in a nutshell that there was a project where poisonous snakes were purchased in South Africa, in the Northern Transvaal, that they were placed in a specially manufactured cage, in a carrier bag with a mechanism which, when activated, would make the bottom of the case drop out.  An unknown agent was recruited in Namibia, who would then attend a large meeting of SWAPO members, which would be addressed by former exiles.  This person would have caused a stampede among the people present, by activating this cage.  If people were bitten by the snakes, then it would be as such, but the idea was to get people to trample each other to death during such a stampede.\n\tWhether this really took place, whether the plan was ever implemented, I don't know.  Furthermore he told me of the sabotage of vehicles, that a project was to be launched which would disrupt SWAPO's logistical structure, which would involve taxi's, which transported people to the major centres such as Keetmanshoop and Swakopmund.\n\tThere were mixtures of liquid which were manufactured to get the vehicles to stall.  Experiments were conducted with gas cans which would be placed in the exhaust systems of the cars as well as causing an explosion in the silencer systems of the cars.  Then there were also persons in SWAPO who were targeted, for their vehicles to be burnt out so as to discourage other white people from becoming members of SWAPO.\n\tI thought that the second scenario was a complete waste of time, and I said so, but this was what was conveyed to me.  Then with regard to the Hamutenya incident, there were no developments.  As I have already told you, later I flew back to Pretoria so that I could be further informed regarding Namibia, but this never took place.  \n\tThen there was the Mati Attasari incident, in which I was personally involved in South-West.  Mr Mati Attasari was the same person who along with Cyril Ramaphosa visited the stockpile locations.  He was the Chief Representative of the United Nations, UNTAG in Namibia at that stage.\n\tKobus le Roux came to see me one evening in the hotel and told me that there was something else that had to be done, that he had been tasked about this, and he used words to the effect that \"Mati Attasari had to be fucked up good and well.\"  He asked whether I would be prepared to do so.  He was not supposed to be killed, but he had to receive a good hiding.\n\tHe asked whether there was any information available and I was told that the CCB had information available that Attasari on the following evening, would be at the Keetmanshoop Hotel attending a meeting, or addressing a meeting, I am not certain which one of the two.  There were two vehicle registration numbers and two descriptions.  One was a sedan vehicle, and the other was a United Nations UNTAG kombi.\n\tThey said that he didn't move with bodyguards, but that he did have a driver and that the meeting at the hotel would  commence at approximately eight o'clock that evening.  I discussed the matter with him somewhat, he would assist me with regard to the getaway vehicle.  I thought of taking a baseball bat, we drove to the premises to reconnoitre it, and there was a regular flow of pedestrian traffic in and out of the hotel.  It did not lend itself to the use of a baseball bat.\n\tWe had to figure out what to take, which would injure the person without killing him.   I foresaw that once I saw him, I would run into him and simply do him in.  What then took place was that I suggested to Mr le Roux that I suggested to Mr le Roux that he buy me an iron saw because the grip handle was a very good knuckle buster, one could make a good knuckle buster out of such a handle.\n\tI knew this due to my movements in and around the Johannesburg night-clubs and because with the gangster wars in the earlier years, and that was a favourite weapon and I was also involved in this whole set-up with this people at that stage.\n\tI knew what sort of damage such a weapon could cause and I knew that it also offered absolute protection to one's hands in case of injury or cuts or bruises.  It was also the kind of thing that one could conceal in a pocket and then bring out at the last instant.\n\tHowever, there was always the possibility especially if one was attacking somebody who was older than oneself, and also smaller than oneself.  I knew what he looked like, I had seen pictures of him in the media, they had given me a photo of him as well.  If one were to hit him and hit him in the wrong place, one could kill him.  I said this to Mr le Roux, and I said \"there are no guarantees with the job.   I am going to try, I will try to hit him on his body and attack his limbs and make a quick getaway\".\n\tWe had a 4 x 4 vehicle with false number plates, which we were going to use as the getaway vehicle.

At a certain stage, I had a whole system of nine escort agencies surrounding Shell House which I could name up, like that.\n\tI began keeping a record of them, it was actually a front, but I was busy with Military Intelligence.  I used drugs with these people, I had access to buildings, I tasked people within the criminal underworld to move in on MK members who had been identified, to establish contact with them, to make friends with them.  I established a prostitution network where prostitutes were tasked with long-term and short-term plans.  Long-term would be for them to hire a flat near Shell House, in the Diplomat Hotel which was furnished and rent it.  It was equipped with telephones, video cameras and sound equipment which would then record persons.  Two prostitutes would be placed in the apartment who would then specifically work on these MK members.\n\tThey had to get them to stay there and entertain them with alcohol and drugs, then we would get hold of their keys.  In this way make duplicates, take documents that they had on them.  Some of the conversations they had, were also recorded and this would then be used to get them in a situation where they were planted with drugs and stolen items and so forth.  \n\tShort-term, prostitutes would sleep with them, and then they would explain or arrange that the prostitute would go out with the MK member, but use a vehicle which she knew was stolen and she wouldn't tell him that, she would say that she needed to fetch something in Eldorado Park, like drugs and that he should take the car and just drive around the block, because otherwise they would appear to be suspicious, and then an MI team would be rigged from the police and as soon as she withdrew from the place, she would be picked up and the man wouldn't know that he would be driving a stolen car, and perhaps there would be a gun that was planted in the vehicle.\n\tThe police would pick him up and he would be involved.

The MK, ANC, was in the country and the targets changed, we have to focus on the SACP, then we have to focus on MK, then we are not allowed to go close to them, then we have to focus on APLA. There was also a problem with funding, we could not get hold of the funds that we were used to.\n\tThen Righ Verster addressed me at a certain stage where he told me that we have to try and get hold of our own funds to keep up the system, because we do not have the support from the top any more.\n\tThen we made a decision and he brought me under the impression that it was also authorised from higher up that we must now generate money, but by means of taking on the criminals and must not rob a bank or rob somebody on the street, but I should focus on drug dealers.  I created a team with Eugene Riley, myself, Mark Francis and another coloured person.\n\tThey were the main characters, and one of the first robberies that we did, was 12 000 mandrax tables, I sold it five or six times.  Every time I sell it through a specific person, Marak Francis who was an underworld figure that I recruited, he would act as the seller.  People from Newcastle would come to buy the tablets, he would give them a good price, they buy it, and as they drive away with the tablets, we will have a police vehicle, pull them off the road and take it back.  I did it and sold it at various opportunities and various times.\n\tWe would keep a third of the money for ourselves, a third would be given to the person who did the front-line work, and a third would then be used in the system.  But it rotted at the end, the whole process that we were busy with.\n\tI robbed the Nigerians in Johannesburg, I robbed them of all their drugs, and if I was convicted of that, I would have done 500 more years of prison service.  Things got out of hand.\n\tOne of the robberies that we committed was in Lusasaneng in Bophuthatswana.  Things went wrong, there was a lot of shooting.   Eugene Riley was wounded in the face and in the body.  He was not arrested at the scene, but after they chased him, he was arrested.  I got away and another person got away.  Eugene Riley and Mark Francis were arrested.\n\tTo give you some background on Mark Francis, he was a very prominent member in the Johannesburg underworld, who also served a sentence for a bank robbery.  I also knew him from when I was a Detective at the SANAP Branch.    I then made him an informer.  I knew him from the prison and I pulled him into the system.\n\tAt a later stage he received a salary and he organised for certain access.  He knew about the system, especially about the unit that I ran in Hillbrow and in Johannesburg Central.  Things went wrong at the Lusasaneng.  This robbery that went wrong, it was a bona fide robbery.  They had R600 000 that they robbed from somebody else, they were switching diamonds and this money was at a specific premises.  We hit the target at about four o'clock in the morning, myself, Riley and another person who drove the vehicle.\n\tWe had balaclavas on, we penetrated the house and then when the shooting took place, Riley fell, other people were wounded as well.  We got away, myself and another person, but Riley and Francis were arrested at a later stage.\n\tI was found guilty of the robbery and what happened then was, when we arrived back in Johannesburg, Mr Francis, while he was arrested, he admitted that, or he implicated me in front of a Magistrate, he said that we gave him Uzzis.  I was a member of the CCB.  Amongst others, the investigative team who detained me concerning the Webster murder, went to Bophuthatswana to go and see him there, he made a report to them.  On the grounds of his allegation they came back to me, but I denied everything.\n\tI got Francis and Riley out on bail.  I got them out.  When they arrived back in Johannesburg, I took Mr Francis to an Attorney and he made a statement to counter his previous statement, because I knew they were going to use the first statement in order to deliver me out, but he had already made a statement after he was released, that he only implicated me because he saw that this was what the people wanted and he thought it was hit-squad activities, and he used that, but that indeed it was not true, I did not accompany and he was putting it in a different way, now that there was no pressure on him.  He was very scared of me, because I knew this person created a lot of problems for me, but the statement cleared the way for me, that they cannot deliver me out to Bophuthatswana, and there were no way in which they could get to me.  I was not charged.  Eugene Riley and Francis were both charged.\n\tThen I received information from  a prostitute that Francis said that before he went to jail in Bophuthatswana, before he is going to jail in Bophuthatswana, he will expose all my activities in my unit.  Apparently he made contact with members in Brixton and at the same stage Eugene Riley received the same information from a different source, a police source.\n\tMyself and Eugene Riley then realised that this is a really big problem and I had no other choice, but to report this to Righ Verster because my bosses Gerrie Bornman and Righ Verster, they all had meetings with Mr Francis, where they questioned him.   Carol-Ann Burt and Christopher Human, they all knew.\n\tI handed over this information to him, what this man was planning to do and within a day, Verster came back to me and he told me that the instruction was \"this person must immediately be killed.\"  I said \"this is not a problem, I will shoot him\".  He said \"he must not be shot, it must seem, it must look as if it is a gang related attack\", the same way as Dr Webster was killed.   We had to use a different method.\n\tI then thought about it, I thought about using a knife, or to hit him until he died.  Mr Riley had a trust between the two of them, because they acted in Lusasaneng together.  First it was just once a week, then twice a week, and later it was just once a month.\n\tWe would go then on a specific day, to go and report and the previous evening we discussed that Eugene Riley will get Francis to go to a certain alley in Hillbrow, Berea, and I would then wait there and kill him there.  That same time, when this happened, there was also an issue with Vlakplaas, I had problem with Tokarev Bezuidenhout.  What made the whole issue more sensitive was that I already tasked Francis to work on Bezuidenhout in Berea, who lived in some Mansions, I cannot recall.  It was very close to the hotel that Staal Burger had at that time, in Berea.\n\tThey used drugs together, they drank cough medicine together and we wanted to make use of him, and he knew that we were busy working on Tokarev Bezuidenhout.  Things worked in that way that I got out of the vehicle with a baseball bat, it was a Sunday evening, I walked into the alley and at the bottom of the alley, it is an alley behind a street, it is very dark.  There is an entrance that was built in, I waited there, Mr Riley walked around with Mr Francis.  He told him that he hid mandrax there and that he wanted Francis to test it for Chinese people who wanted to buy it.  It was only samples that had to be tested, and he pulled Francis into the alley.  I came from the back, with the baseball bat and I hit him.  The first blow that I dealt him, was very hard, but something happened and he ducked and I hit him on the arm or the shoulder, and he fell down.\n\tHe is not my size, he is much smaller.  Riley jumped to the front, picked Francis up from the ground and he said \"Mark, they are attacking us\".  At that stage I was able to hit him against his head, I could hear his head explode.  He fell and he never got up.  I placed the baseball bat behind me and walked away, but he started shouting.  It all happened in a few seconds.  I walked up into the alley and Mr Riley followed me.\t\n\tI left the alley, got into a vehicle that we parked there beforehand.  I placed the bat in a plastic bag and I put it in a rubbish bin.  We drove to the Westdene Dam and I threw the bat into the Westdene Dam, over the fence.  Myself and Riley drove.  We went to go and pick up petrol that we bought beforehand.  We all got into a rubbish bag and we took all our clothes off, our shoes as well, we put it in bags, we dressed in clothes that we had ready.  We took the petrol, doused the clothes and set it alight.",

            "That is correct Mr Chairperson.  What happened was that the Goldstone Commission in that same time, while I was involved in the Webster formal post mortem inquest, the Goldstone Commission exposed something in the media.  They raided the DCC Arak Building, the Headquarters and they got hold, and they exposed myself and my unit.  I wrote a document on request, I made or presented them with a planning strategy, how we can disrupt MK, what we could do to disrupt them, because they were so close to the criminal world, I made such a presentation or submission and in broader terms it dealt with, I told them where they were involved with crime and where they were not involved in criminal activities, we had to frame them by infiltrating criminals and place that person in a compromising position and then arrest them.\n\tThat is what it was in broader terms, it was a very big document.  I mentioned certain agents that I proposed to use, night-club owners, bouncers, prostitutes, criminals, all of them had to be used for this project, and I also arranged for access, access in terms of the voters' roll, the South African Bureau's computers, the Traffic Department, Telkom, Receiver of Revenue, all the records, I had access to all of these departments, and as part of this document, I included all of this.\n\tI also recruited somebody by means of putting pressure on him.  He had to do with the computer systems in Shell House, people of DCC were used to deal with that, because I had no knowledge of computers.  But the person that I recruited by placing pressure on him, he gave them access to these computers. \tThis document was found by Judge Goldstone, I cannot believe that DCC kept that document, because you can see it is CCB type of actions.  When this document was exposed in the media, Judge Goldstone informed the media, it was on all the main news bulletins, and they made a big halloo-balloo that I was a convicted criminal and that I was applied, and that the State section was turned into a monster, I supported the system.  I consulted with the officers and decided to take the punch, I will go in and testify in front of the Goldstone Commission because I was subpoenaed to appear before them, that I was the author of the document.\n\tThat was the presentation that I made, and how I explained it, but that was never implemented.   The reason why it was not implemented, I told them, was because my Commanders came to me and said it is a CCB type of operation, we do not work like that in DCC.  We are a support structure of the police and only an Intelligence collection service.\n\tI misled the Goldstone Commission by telling them that this whole unit was not applied in such a way, which was not the truth.  The Goldstone Commission, after they exposed it in the media, a day or two later, with Attorney Piet du Plessis, sitting next to me, we called for a press conference, stating the Defence Force's side.  Where on national and international TV, I denied that it was implemented and I attacked Judge Goldstone's integrity by saying I was disappointed in the fact that he only presented the one side, that although I did make the presentation, it was never accepted or implemented.\n\tThis was however not the truth.   It was approved and it was done in that way.",

Mr Barnard, the fact of the matter remains, you cannot get amnesty irrespective of what you have just told the Commission.

            "FERDINAND BARNARD",
            "Well Mr Chairperson, I did not want to make any revelations, initially I said I was not interested in that.  I looked at the whole issue surrounding Dullah Omar and Bishop Tutu, that if Slang van Zyl incriminates me in any way, I would then create a safety net concerning the TRC process, that was my whole idea, I would support him in all his applications, up until the second appearance in front of the Commission.\n\tI am not proud about what I did, not about anything.  I was misled, I am disappointed in myself, in my naivete and it is something that I have to live with, but at the end of the day, I am in a situation currently where I spend 97 percent of the day in solitary confinement.  This is the situation for the last 27  months.\n\tI have been in prison now for three months, longer than three months and where I have spent 27 months in C-Max, which is South Africa's Alcatraz.  I am detained under these circumstances.  You can compare it with sitting in this berth in which the interpreters are sitting, to be let out between eight and eleven in the morning for three hours' exercise, you have to wash your clothes, you have to shower and you must come back.  The point that I am trying to make is that psychologically all these issues started bothering me, but I wanted to play the game as I did before, I wanted to continue with the fraud and the lies, still up until the second part of the sitting.  Something happened here that really touched me, and if you will allow me, I will quickly describe this to you.\n\tBy nature of the situation, when something like this happens to one as had happened to me, I played the game, all the way with everyone, and then everyone left me.  I am in the situation where I received an instruction from Slang van Zyl, but he himself came and testified against me and I got ten years' imprisonment.  No one forced him to do so, no one made any threats against him.  He came to me that morning at the court and said \"good morning\", went and sat in the bench and put me away for ten years.\n\tThis wasn't the only evidence which caused damage.  There was the Judge and he is not stupid.  This is a man, he could see, who came from the system, who knew what was going on, so he would make the link with Webster and all the other things that he was testifying about, by nature of the situation.\n\tThe same with Lafras Luitingh.  He did the same and Righ Verster, three persons who gave instructions to me, who were more senior in the organisation than I was.  All three testified against me in my criminal trial and sent me to prison.  And all of them are walking about freely outside.  For no moment would I want 35 more people to come to prison.  I cannot really see how that would promote reconciliation, and I do not want to be part of that.\n\tA large proportion of what I am doing here today, is because I know that this is evidence which cannot be used in criminal proceedings.   What made me come here to tell the truth is basically the straw that broke the camel's back.  Since the first session at the Head Office, as I was led in and out, I was the closest to the gallery where the victims were seated and I watched them closely.\n\tI saw that they were doubtful, that they were frustrated.  I could see that they were enraged when they saw that someone wasn't speaking the truth and I began to ponder these things.  What happened to me personally is when I walked passed them every afternoon, although they were angry at the witnesses, I don't blame them, I would have felt exactly the same way, perhaps even more so, every afternoon as I was led passed them, they greeted me in a friendly manner and wished me well.\n\tMost prominently Dullah Omar's wife, Mrs Omar.  At first I thought that they were being sarcastic, as if they felt that they had me in a position.  I thought that they were relishing in the moment, that was the impression that I had.  Indeed that was not the case.  Upon the second occasion, here, as you can recall it was in winter, and there were queries which were made by Mrs Omar, and she wanted to know why I didn't have a jacket.\n\tUpon a following occasion she wanted to know who was feeding me, and this doesn't come from my own people, they went to the hotel during the day.  No one here from my own people was worried whether I had anything to eat or not.  You will recall in the first session last time, Calla Botha wasn't here, there were only two people who were supporting me.  In three years no one from DCC or the CCB, no one from the entire Security set-up came to visit me once in prison, with the exception of Mr Calla Botha who came to see me every month and Mr Chap Maree.\n\tBoth of them have supported me both financially and otherwise, and then it would take those who suffered as a result of my deeds and my offences, who came to me and put the coals on my forehead.  They performed acts of kindness towards me, while I hurt them.  They were worried about whether I was warm enough, whether I had enough to eat, and what I realised here is that these people were offering a hand of reconciliation to me.\n\tIt upset me tremendously, I lay awake at night in my cell from that moment onwards, night after night.  When I arrived here the following day and walked passed again and Mrs Omar said to me that I must have a good night's rest and that she would pray for me, it was a dam wall that burst within me, and at that moment, I decided that under no circumstances could I ever return here and lie further to these people.\n\tI hope now that what I have said here today, will help to relieve the burden of uncertainty, especially when it comes to me.  By nature of the matter, I am deeply regretful regarding what I had done.   I am not trying to put the blame for what I have done, on anybody else's shoulders, I did what I did and I believe that there must be retribution for what I have done.  I took lives and there are irreversible consequences as a result of this.  I injured others, I tried to kill others and I have a deep sense of regret regarding what I did, not the fact that I was caught, but it has become so much more important than this for me.\n\tI do not wish to insult the amnesty process in any way, but if I were to be granted amnesty for anything that I have done, it would be of academic interest and there is only one place for me to go after this, and that is C-Max and solitary confinement.  There is no way in which I could walk out of these doors and go elsewhere, I know that.  For me it has become sufficient enough and significant enough, that I reconcile with the victims, that I have the opportunity to express my regret for what I have done to them.\n\tThey are much better people than I am.   I would like to put all of this behind me, I want to do this for my own peace of mind, and for my own state of mind, and for my own conscience.  I have friends who are supporting me, people that were not part of the world that I was involved in, they have supported me since day 1.  They have stayed with me since I was locked up, to this very day.  They have told me to speak the truth, every single time.  They encouraged me to submit applications, I went against the advice of my parents and my friends because I was stubborn, because there was something in me that was preventing me from walking with you one day and selling you out, the next.  I simply cannot do that.  To me it is like climbing a mountain, what I have done here today.\n\tWhat Mrs Omar and the others did for me, awakened sentiments within me which meant that I could no longer see my way open to come here and lie.   For me it is not about putting Joe Verster in a precarious position, I don't want him to go to jail.  I don't want the spineless politicians to go to jail, although I must admit that someone like Roelf Meyer and Pik Botha would look rather good in one of the C-Max jump-suits.  I have thought numerous times that it would be quite pleasant to see them, just for a week in C-Max, so that they could see how it feels.\n\tBut I don't want all of us to be sitting there, 45 in a row, every morning in C-Max.  What kind of reconciliation is that?  That isn't reconciliation, I don't want that.  I want the politicians who betrayed us and who sold us out, just to come forward and say, like Siphiwe Nyanda who is the Head of the Military, who had everything to lose.  I sit in my cell and I read what that man has done.  He accepts responsibility for his people who didn't even act under his direct instructions, collectively he comes forward and he says \"that man did this and that.  I was in command at that point in time, in that area, and I will accept full responsibility for what he has done\".  Why can one of these persons like Pik Botha who is a real chameleon, I have seen him running over to the ANC now, he is an adder, the ANC must be warned, \"if you let that man into your circles, you will be bitten\".\n\tFurthermore he is a war criminal and a diamond smuggler, along with Jonas Savimbi, he is also a war criminal.  Then there is Roelf Meyer who sold me out completely on TV.  He didn't even know that I was working for DCC, but what happened was when this whole thing burst with the Goldstone Commission, Roelf Meyer went and issued a statement and said that the Military didn't know anything about me.  But when he realised how big and how sensitive the thing was, that it had to be discussed on the highest of levels, they came to me with a document that I had to sign so that I wouldn't embarrass the Defence Force and so forth and just shifted me around.\n\tRoelf Meyer was the one who composed the documents.  I had to shift.  In the meantime he lied to Aziz Pahad on TV and I watched this, I watched him sell me out.  I watched him say \"we know nothing about this man, he is a calculated criminal, he is a liar\", they are the ones who sponsored the very likes of me.  But there he would sell me out.  I am not alone in this.\n\tKevin Wood who was in Zimbabwe and who is being detained in a high maximum security institution, they all did these things for the same reasons as I.  They were betrayed in exactly the same way as I.  I have two of Kevin Wood's letters to me.   I brought them with, if you wish to see them, you can read them.  I will explain the essence of it to you.\n\tI just want to sketch to you what we are dealing with in terms of the politicians, such as Pik Botha and FW de Klerk.  FW de Klerk makes as if he didn't have anything to do with it, I would like to tell you that he is the biggest conman on two legs.   He is the biggest conman, he has conned the international community to such an extent that they gave him the Nobel Peace Prize, which I feel is a slap in the face to Nelson Mandela, if ever there was one.\n\tSlang van Zyl, who has been touring around testifying against everybody like the Boswell Wilkie Circus, who gave the same evidence in the Wouter Basson case; FW de Klerk who states that he didn't know about the existence of the CCB, it was the most interesting thing that I had seen in a long time, the following day in the newspaper, after Slang van Zyl gave evidence, I listened the afternoon before on 702, but the following day in the newspaper, there was a report which stated that FW de Klerk has come out of his corner and has stated that this proves indeed that he did not know about the existence of the CCB. \n\tChairperson, he would start off in such a way that would make even an Olympic champion jealous of such speed.  It is like two children saying that they didn't steal the biscuits.  He must have known.  How could anybody still believe to this very day that these politicians did not know what we were busy with?  But they refuse to admit it.\n\tDo you know why?  It is because they are sitting in the front rows with healthy pensions, no one can touch them, they system is engineered in such a way that nothing can be attached to them.  What is the problem?  They don't have a problem.  Kevin Wood writes to me that for 10 years he struggled to have his South African birth right recognised by the former National Party government, the very same people who abused him and put him in the situation that he is in today.\n\tWhen the ANC took over, in 1994, and this is in his letter, my Advocate has it in his possession, in his own words, he has written me this in the last two years, the ANC government was established, and within three to four months after the application, the ANC government came along and he writes -\n\"... then a black government did the honourable thing\".\n\tHe wrote a letter to Pik Botha.  Pik Botha was then the Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry, and he responded and he quotes in the letter to me on what date the letter of Pik Botha was sent to him and that Pik Botha wrote that it is regrettable that he is in the situation that he finds himself in, after justifiable official operations were conducted.  He sent that letter to Alex Boraine of the TRC and Mr Pik \"Chameleon\" Botha went and misconstrued everything and told Alex Boraine that he simply did that in order to improve the circumstances of the people up there.  \tHe didn't mean to give official recognition to such persons, and this is what we are dealing with.   \n\tKevin Wood isn't even asking to be released, he is asking to be transferred to South Africa, that is all.  Our own people are betraying us, there is no way in which they will help us.\n\tThe same with FW de Klerk and Roelf Meyer, Neil Barnard from National Intelligence.  He stands there with that little face of his, all he needs is a halo, he stands like a little \"voortrekker\" waiting in line for sweets, but he is actually the devil, he is the devil because he is the physical person who is responsible for the situation that Kevin Wood finds himself in.\n\tHe isn't concerned with anything or anybody, he denies the very existence of these people, and that is how it continues.  I have deviated from the path somewhat.",

I would like to apologise for any share that I had, whether direct or indirect in any of the things that caused problems for them, that caused tragedy and tears for them, that created uncertainty in their lives, and particularly because Mrs Omar is here today, I would like to say that her attitude has meant that I have done what I have done here, yesterday and today, specifically that tipped the scales for me and led me to speak the truth.\n\tI would like to thank her because it is valuable to me.  It was with malice and an evil heart that I came to your residence where you and your family were supposed to feel safe and I came with the express purpose of killing your husband and the head of your household, Dullah Omar, I did everything in my power to materialise this plan.  I know today that it would have been utterly wasted.\n\tFurthermore I am in a prison where originally the prison was constructed for executions, and I cannot tell you how many times I have thought that if it wasn't for the efforts of people like Adv Dullah Omar to abolish capital punishment, I would have been a dead man.  So what happens now?  I am doing everything in my power to kill him and to cause his family damage, but they pray for me and they do everything to assist me and indirectly, they save my life.\n\tI cannot express my regret.   In some bizarre manner, it gives me satisfaction to know that I am paying for what I have done.  My greatest desire is no longer to be released from prison, I would like to become the old Ferdi Barnard once again.  I would like to become what I was before I became involved in this mess, before the police, before everything.  Even if it has to take place in a prison cell, even if I spend the rest of my natural life in a super maximum correctional facility, it has become important to me that people try to understand my circumstances and that they try to forgive me.\n\tThere is a life after this, and if it means that I will spend the rest of my life in prison, I would like to do so with a clear conscience, with a peaceful state of mind away from all this mess that I have helped to create.\n\tMy parents and my family are decent people.  My friends are decent, straight forward people.  They do not deserve what I have done to them.  I owe them an apology as well.  I owe Dr Webster's next-of-kin, in particular Ms Maggie Friedman, an unconditional apology.  I know it does not change anything.  You know how it feels for me, it feels as if a man comes to you and jumps into bed with your wife and then the next minute just says \"sorry\", what does that do?  It does not change the situation, because the damage is done.\n\tSorry is what you say when you spill a drink on a man and if you do it again, you are looking for trouble.  What I feel and what I have experienced, goes so much deeper than that.  I cannot express to you in words how I feel.  I just want you to try to find a place in your heart somewhere you could forgive me.  I have made mistakes, I am being punished for them, I am taking the punishment like a man, I don't want to put anybody else  in prison, I don't want to testify against them.\n\tI will continue to meet out my sentence as such.
