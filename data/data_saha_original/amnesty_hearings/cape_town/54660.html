<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Valus, you may call your witness - your client rather.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> As it pleases Mr Chairman, I call Ginotry Danster.  He will testify in Xhosa, that is his mother tongue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do we have the facilities for this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, we've organised that already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there a microphone there for him sit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Mr Chairman, sorry to interrupt, may I enquire whether the Committee has come to any decision concerning the evidence of Mr Coetzee or whether that would be left over until later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, it will.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR WAGENER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Danster, are you prepared to take the oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">GINOTRY DANSTER:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR ROUX:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>	Mr Danster, you joined the South African Police in April 1978?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> After your basic training was finished, where were you stationed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I worked in Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> What department in Port Elizabeth or the South African Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Security police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> During 1981, you went to Bloemfontein to fetch a terrorist, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think you should do that you know.  I think that where matters are contested, try and avoid putting leading questions to him where it is likely that that evidence might be challenged.  So rather put your questions in such a way that they don't suggest the answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> As it pleases Mr Chairman, I will.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where in Port Elizabeth were you stationed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> At 44 Strand Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was the nature of the work that you did whilst you were in the security police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We were investigating people who break laws in accordance with politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Under whom did you work at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Under Mr du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And were you in Port Elizabeth all the time or did they move you around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I was in Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you drive government vehicles, police vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know a man who was detained one Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did you come to know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We went to fetch him from Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is we?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Captain du Plessis, Buzani and Raath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you may proceed from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>	When was that when you went to fetch Mr Kondile, more or less that you can remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Early '80's</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Where did you go to in Bloemfontein when you went to fetch him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We went to the security police offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Yes, and then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We then slept over, got up in the morning and we left with a black policeman to the police station in Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Did this policeman lead you to anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We were given a command by Captain du Plessis to go and fetch Sizwe from where he was detained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Did you succeed in this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We booked him out and we took him to the security police offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Do you know what happened with Mr Kondile after this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We took him back to Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> What happened in Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We took him to Captain du Plessis's office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Could I just ask Mr Danster, what was Sizwe Kondile's physical demean at the time, was he injured, was he fine?  What was your observation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He was all right, in good health.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Mr Danster tell me, how many motor vehicles went to Bloemfontein to fetch him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> One car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> What kind of car was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Datsun Laurel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And how many of you returned together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> It Buzani, Raath, Captain du Plessis, Sizwe, Kondile and myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> On of the reasons I asked the question is, if you look at Volume 2 page 178, there is an entry here at Humansdorp, Friday the 10th of July 1981.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I can see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Sorry, give me a minute, I know I saw an entry and I just want to see if it's the same one, yes, it's the same one - that he was admitted to the cells and his nose was bleeding.  Is that on the day that you fetched him, no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I don't know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I just want to be absolutely clear, give me the names of the people you said.  Yourself, Mr du Plessis, Mr Kondile and who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Buzani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And anybody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Mr Raath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you returned in the same car in which you had gone up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We had a problem in the car, they fetched another car.  I will tell you the people who fetched the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> My questions was, did you return in the same car from Bloemfontein in which you had gone to Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I think we had a problem with that car, it heated up and we had to borrow another car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see, so you borrowed another car.  And the car the you borrowed, is that now a Datsun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All right.  Carry on please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> You testified that Kondile was taken to Mr du Plessis office in Port Elizabeth, can you tell the Commission what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We took him out of the car, we covered his head with a balaclava, he was handcuffed.  It must have been in the afternoon, later afternoon as people had already left from the offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> We then went into the office and Mr du Plessis asked him a few questions.  After that he made a call and made arrangements for him to be detained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Do you know where this place was that was arranged for detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I didn't go personally however I was there when arrangements were being made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>MR ROUX</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Did you hear the place that was mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He phoned Mr Jonker in Jeffrey's Bay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Did you take part in ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> What was your part with Mr Kondile then again?  When did you become involved with him again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Mr du Plessis had given us the information that we were supposed to get from him, this was written on paper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> When did you receive the paper?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> After Kondile had been detained in Jeffrey's Bay, Raath, Buzani and myself together with Mr du Plessis were given orders and we were given that piece of paper written the details which we were to ask Mr Kondile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Mr Danster, let us go back to the first day where you arrived from Bloemfontein.  After this phone call to make arrangements for his detention, what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I was taken home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> And the next time you had anything to do with Mr Kondile, was in Jeffrey's Bay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I was given an order to stay in Jeffrey's Bay for a while by Captain du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think the question was: when, how many days after you had brought Mr Kondile to Port Elizabeth, did you next ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I'm not sure but it was soon after we'd come back with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> In Jeffrey's Bay, were you alone - the only person who was instructed to go to Jeffrey's Bay to Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.  No, it was Raath and myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Did you follow the instructions that were given to you in connection with the questionnaire that you received?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> What was the result of the questions?  Did Mr Kondile answer the questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We would give him a pen and a paper to write down the answers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Did he give you all the answers to all the questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We took all the answers and gave them to Mr du Plessis.  After he arrived in Jeffrey's Bay he said these were not the answers, this is not the information that he'd wanted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Before we continue, just tell the Commission, where was Mr Kondile held and where were the questions asked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He was in the office that was emptied for us to use.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> If he wasn't asked, where was he detained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> In the cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Now, you testified that Mr du Plessis wasn't satisfied with the answers, what was his reaction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Captain du Plessis arrived with his colleagues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He said: "When you are investigating a terrorist, this is how you go about it, you have got to get the truth".  He then showed us the way you retrieve information from a terrorist.  Sizwe was tied at the knees.  He said I must handcuff him from the back.  We then made him lie on the floor and we put a sack on him - we refer to it as: "the prisoner's bag".</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> What did you describe the bag as?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Prisoner's bag - Prisoner's property bag. We put this over his head and you have to put this on very tightly so that he can't breach and then at the same time there was a small machine ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The interpreter could not hear the speaker.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> This machine has a crank handle with two wires.  When you use this crank handle it's very painful to the victim.  That is how information was retrieved from a prisoner.  Every time we saw that he's suffocating we took the bag off his head and then he'd be asked questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Sorry, if I can interrupt you there.  You described now to the Commission, the prisoner bag and you described the machine with the crank handle, was this now what was used by Mr du Plessis to show you how to get information out of or how to get the truth out of somebody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Was Mr du Plessis alone there while he showed you this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> It was himself, Raath and myself.  Gideon Niewoudt and Roelofse were there, also Buzani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Well, before we get to that, just explain to me what role does this electrical box play, this cranking business, how was that used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> This machine when used, is very, very painful, you will give us any information that we want from you because of the pain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How does it give the pain?  What does the machine do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> It shocks you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is the word choke or is the word shock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Shock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> While we're on that subject, can you just describe to the Commission how this machine operates?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> U turn it, there's a handle and the second person takes the two wires, puts it on your body wherever they choose to.  If you wind this machine to be more powerful you splash water on the victim and then the victim will give us the information because of the pain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's try and confine yourself as to what you did on this particular occasion, do you understand?  Tell us who put this bag on Mr Kondile's head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We all took part in that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who operated that crank handle of this machine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> The Captain showed us how to use the machine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> My question is, who did it, who handled the crank handle on Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We all used the machine and turned the crank handle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who held the wires?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> When one is turning the handle, the other person would have to put the wires on his body, whoever it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So, do I gather from you that all of you, at some time or the other turned the crank handle and all of you at some time or the other, held the wires to the body of Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and who did the questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Mr du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> What was Mr Kondile's attitude towards co-operating during the initial weeks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> During when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> During the initial weeks of detainment in Jeffrey's Bay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> That's a leading question, the witness never said that ...[indistinct] was initially detained for weeks in Jeffrey's Bay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I'll correct that.  How long was Mr Kondile detained in Jeffrey's Bay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Quite a long time, I think plus minus 12 weeks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> During the initial weeks of his detainment, what was his attitude towards co-operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He would not co-operate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Despite the use of little machine you were talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We used a car tube and the machine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Can you tell the commission about this car tube you just mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> The car tube is round, you cut it, close it on the top so that there is no air for the victim and he would struggle to breath.  In the same instance the machine is being used on his body that gives pain to the victim and it tires him quickly.  We'd then remove the tube after you'd collapsed and feinted, to give him a bit of air.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was the tube put around the head of Mr Kondile as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What happened to the prisoner's bag, would that stay on his head while the tube is put around his face or was the bag removed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> The bag was removed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, you were asked whether Mr Kondile co-operated at first by answering questions and you said that at first he did not co-operate and my question to you was, is that despite the use of these methods on him that he did not co-operate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He gave us a lot of information after we had tortured him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Did Captain du Plessis play any role after that first display of how to get information or the truth out of the person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He would get in touch with us from day to day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You know that doesn't seem to be an answer to the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> What was the purpose of him getting in touch with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He wanted information, answers of what we'd asked Mr Kondile.  He wanted to know if we were getting the information that we'd targeted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Did he give any instructions regarding the fact that in the initial weeks Mr Kondile wasn't so co-operative?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Please repeat  your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> In the initial weeks you testified Mr Kondile wasn't so co-operative, did Mr du Plessis say anything about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Tell the commission if you can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He said that we should not beat him up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Did he afford a reason for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Because he does not want a: "Steve Biko" case again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> What do you know about Mr van Rensburg in regard to Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> As Mr van Rensburg was the head, he would come to Jeffrey's Bay with Mr Erasmus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> If you say he would come to Jeffrey's Bay, where in Jeffrey's Bay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He would come to the room where we were interrogating Sizwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Was Mr van Rensburg or Erasmus ever present while there was an interrogation taking place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> They would get there and talk to Captain du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] present when Mr Kondile was being interrogated, that's the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No, they would just go there to assess the progress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> What was the purpose of the interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> The orders by Captain du Plessis were such ...[inaudible] He wanted to know about ammunition, people who were trained guerrillas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman, just help - sorry Mr Chairman, can I be or assistance, it's not ammunition it's about weapons, not ammunition but weapons.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> What do you know about armed caches?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We were asking him about weapons and wanted to know where the weapons were in South Africa, where they were hidden.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Did this interrogation and torture eventually succeed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Do you know about any pointing out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> After he'd given us certain information, we left for East London, from East London we went to Umtata.  Can I carry on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> In Umtata, according to the information we got from Sizwe, we were with three East London members and we had to go and arrest two men that worked in the bank.  However, as South African Police, we did not have the right to go and arrest people in the Transkei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>	Mr du Plessis then spoke to an officer that was there - that took a while.  This officer then had to go and arrest these two people in the bank.  These two people must have been told that there were police in the bank and they ran away. </p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>	They then went to Butterworth.  These two men in Butterworth being followed by two detectives.  The one police got injured even a woman policeman.  They then ran away towards McCLear with a car.  There was a roadblock in South Africa.  Those two men ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The interpreter could not hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Sorry, Mr Dunster, the interpreter couldn't hear your previous sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> These two men that had shot the woman police and the one male police took their car, used it to get away.  There was a roadblock and when they got there they started shooting, two people were injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Mr Danster, if I can just interrupt you there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>	Mr Chairman, I don't know if this is so relevant to the application at this stage, if I maybe can get back to Mr Kondile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes please ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, one doesn't know whether he witnessed all this or he's repeating what he'd been told by somebody else and even if he did see it, I don't know what it's relevance is to this case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> I was actually - my learned colleagues asked me to ask this.  I didn't intend to examine him like this or lead him on this, I'd rather go back to Mr Kondile specifically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> If I might just ask, having hear this evidence, where were you all of this time?  Did you go to East London, did you go to Umtata?  Did you get as far as the roadblock at McClear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> If we had not gone with Sizwe to the bank, these people would not have been shot, they would not have run away in the first place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> But you personally, you were there, that's really what I want to know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> In Umtata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And East London.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, I was there both times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, let's move on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Was Mr Kondile - do you know anything about Mr Kondile tempted to being turned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What happened?  Did you return after this attempt to arrest those people, did you return to Jeffrey's Bay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I think the Judge was asking me a question, I didn't hear him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> After you went to arrest these two people in Umtata, did you return to Jeffrey's Bay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All of you, including Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the next thing of any importance that happened in which you were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> (No English translation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What's that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Mr du Plessis tried to get Sizwe to work for the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Sizwe refused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What month are we now talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I couldn't tell you the month but it was after a while.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And this was after you had returned to Jeffrey's Bay from Umtata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> What was Mr Kondile's reaction to this attempt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Sizwe response was that Chris Hani trusts him or trusted him.  He could never work for the police, he'd rather be charged and go to court but he would never work for the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> You heard the testimony of the applicants, especially Mr du Plessis who testified about a note being found, do you know anything about this note that was testified here about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I have no knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Mr Danster, ever when Mr Kondile would have been in the shower in Jeffrey's Bay, where would the people who were instructed to guard him be when he was in the shower?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He showered in his shower, they locked the door and the bars.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Then where would you be at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I would be in the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>Would there be anybody in the place where he was being guarded? - I believe it was a barracks or something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He'd be alone in the cell, there would be nobody else there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's just talk about the questioning of Mr Kondile.  You say that you were given a piece of paper by Mr du Plessis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That paper contained the kind of questions that you were to put to Mr Kondile, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In what language did you communicate with Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> English, Xhosa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you talked to Mr Kondile, did you talk to him in English?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I'd speak both English and Xhosa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did Mr Raath have anything to do with questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, he would ask in Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In what language would Mr Kondile reply?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Sizwe would speak to me and I would interpret for Raath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In what language would Mr du Plessis talk to Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And would Mr Kondile reply in English?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Just to sum up, during this whole period of detention, who were all the people involved in the interrogation and torture of Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Perhaps he could if necessary, split it up, who was involved in the interrogation and who was involved in the torture and if they were involved in both, tell us they were involved in both.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I will name them as follows: Captain du Plessis, Captain Roelofse, Niewoudt, Buzani, Raath and myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Were any people from East London involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> There were people from East London that arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> How many?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> A few detectives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes, two or three or?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> More than three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> What did they do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> When the detectives from East London arrived, we then withdrew from investigating the matter, they interrogated Sizwe themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did he give answers to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Were you present at that stage when they interrogated him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No, I wasn't there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now you told us that Mr du Plessis told you that you must not beat him up, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Had he already been beaten at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He'd been tortured but he said that we must not hit him physically or bang him against the wall so that there are marks on his body, external wounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just repeat that, you must not beat him up or bang him against the wall?  Are those his words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, he said we must not beat him up so that there are marks on his body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, you also used the words: "or bang him against the wall".</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, he said that he must not be banged against the wall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, had anybody tried to beat him up or bang him against the wall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And have you seen anybody beat Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No assault took place in your presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No, I saw no assault.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did Mr Kondile ever complain to you that he had been assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No, he never complained to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All right.  Are there any other questions you wish to put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> If I could just clarify very quickly.  The last few answer you gave when the Chairman asked about assaults, you are really talking about the beating and banging against the wall as opposed to the torture that we spoke about earlier - just for clarity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, there's a difference.  When you bang someone against the wall or beat him up with your fists or something, there would be marks on the body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> You mentioned now, the names of du Plessis, Raath, Niewoudt, Roelofse, Buzani and yourself, what was the role that Mr Roelofse played?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He would come from time to time, not frequently and he would help in the interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Did he ever actively take part in the torturing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> If I remember correctly, I think twice he took part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> And the other people you mentioned today, what was their position to actively taking part in torturing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Niewoudt and Roelofse would come together twice, they would ask questions.  They must have used the torturing machine twice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> What can you remember in regard to the sleep that Mr Kondile had during his period of detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Could you repeat your question please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> What can you remember in regard to Mr Kondile's sleeping habits during the period of detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did Mr Kondile sleep during the day or did he sleep during the night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> After we had interrogated him and we would go to sleep, he would sleep as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And to your knowledge, did he have any difficulty sleeping?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I don't know what you mean, please clarify your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was the interrogation done at night or during the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Sometimes we would deprive him of sleep so that he would tire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Can you remember anything about a doctor involved in this case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> There's an old man that arrived there and apparently he was a doctor, a white man. We were then given orders just to ask him questions and not to ill-treat him.  He got some medication, tablets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Who was the person who was giving these orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Captain du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Do you know a man called Dirk Coetzee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, I met him once before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Can you tell the Commission if Dirk Coetzee had anything to do with this case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> When we were investigating the matter Captain du Plessis said that Sizwe Kondile was a top terrorist from the Eastern Cape.  The Pretoria anti-terrorist squad would come as well to get information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>	Dirk then arrived, he was with Mr van Rensburg and Captain du Plessis was in Jeffrey's Bay.  They spoke or talked at the side - the two of them, after that the gentlemen left - Coetzee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Did you at that stage already know that the person was Dirk Coetzee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Not at that stage, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> When did you find that out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> After a while when I already stopped working for the police.  I saw an article in the newspaper, I saw his face in the newspaper and I then remember that it's the man that had arrived at Jeffrey's Bay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Do you know anything about Komatie ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could you kindly stop for a minute.  You said you saw this person Coetzee with van Rensburg, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He was with Mr van Rensburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes.  And then you immediately continued and said Mr du Plessis was in Jeffrey's Bay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, he was in Jeffrey's Bay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And did Mr Coetzee talk to van Rensburg or did he talk to du Plessis or were the three of them together, what was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> The three of them were talking at the side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did they visit the cells or the room where Kondile was kept?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> In the room that we were sitting in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> All three of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> The two of them arrived and Captain du Plessis was inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was he already inside with Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And at that stage, were you inside too?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And Raath, where was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So in the end the three of them and you and Raath and Kondile were all present in this room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did they ask anything from Mr Kondile at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> They did not ask him any questions, they read what he had written.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did anybody ask him whether he's well or whether there's anything wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> They did not talk to him, they spoke to Captain du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> What do you know about Komatiepoort?  Do you know anything about Komatiepoort?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> After he had given us certain information, Captain du Plessis said himself, Raath and myself must go to Komatiepoort where there were weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>	They said that we must stop investigating the matter for a while because we're going to prepare for a journey to Komatiepoort.  I was then taken home and they said that I must wait for him, they are going to fetch me - they did not arrive.  That was during the weekend.  On the Monday when I reported at the office I heard that Raath and Captain du Plessis had already left.  I carried on with my own work at the office and I never saw Sizwe again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>	After a few days Raath came back because I was working with him.  At the security police branch you would work as partners.  When Raath came back he said they had taught Kondile a lesson and he said in Afrikaans: "We taught him a lesson, his brains were splashed all over".  I asked him what he meant because they had left me behind.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>	He asked if I really didn't know what he was talking about.  He did not give me any further information, I made my own conclusions that something drastic had happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Do you know the person called Johan Coetzee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Can you tell if he has anything to do with this case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He arrived in Port Elizabeth, he was the head of the security police, he was a general at the time.  Before Captain du Plessis left with Sizwe, whilst we were still interrogating him, he said that the case was very important and we had to work hard because Sizwe Kondile was a top terrorist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a>	Even Mr Johan Coetzee was going to arrive.  He then arrived together with him in Jeffrey's Bay.  They looked at what Sizwe had written down, they spoke with each other and then they left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Was that the second time that Coetzee came there? - Johan Coetzee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I saw him once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> You say he came there with Captain du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> You say Johan Coetzee was a General at that stage, do you know what happened to him in terms of police ranks later on?MR DANSTER:   After that he was the Commissioner of Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> I understand that this statement was taken by you by Mr Rajeee Marugaan, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Was anything shown to you, any records, any minutes, any statements or affidavits before you made your statement for Mr Marugaan? - in front of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Mr Chairman, that's the evidence in chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> When Mr Coetzee - that's General Coetzee, came down - Johan Coetzee, with Mr du Plessis, where was Kondile at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He was in the room that we were using.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Not in the cells.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did they visit him in the room or did they only pass along?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Sizwe was in the corner tied around the ankles and he was handcuffed to the bed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I don't want us to have any confusion, was that when General Coetzee visited at that stage or was it when Mr Dirk Coetzee visited?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No, those are different times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So you're speaking now about the visit of General Coetzee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did the General speak to Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No, he did not speak to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Not at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He spoke to Captain du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Sorry, Mr Chairman, just one question I forgot to ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>	Just to finalise, can you just tell the Commission what happened to you in regard to the police force after this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I was transferred to New Brighton enquiries, after that I resigned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Just the year, what year was that when you were transferred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Late 1982.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, that's the examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR ROUX</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did you resign?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> 1983.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What sort of work are you doing now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I'm a builder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Would you kindly repeat the answer the last question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I build, I'm a builder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Moosa, are there any questions you wish to put to this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Just one or two Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>	The car that you used to come back from Bloemfontein with Mr Kondile, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I don't remember the car because we had a problem with our own car, it heated up.  The following week the car was fetched by Mahote and Adana from Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> The car that you actually used to come back, what happened to that car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> It was returned to Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> How did you address Mr Kondile, what name did you use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Sizwe.  His code name was: "crazy"</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Thank you, no further questions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOOSA</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Two minutes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> When you went to fetch Mr Kondile from Bloemfontein, were you told by anyone how he got to be arrested? - either by a security officer of Mr Kondile himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Captain du Plessis said that he'd been arrested close to Lesotho, do you know or was that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We got details from Sizwe when we were investigating the matter.  He was going to phone his girlfriend, apparently the phones were not working from the Lesotho side.  He was arrested along the border post.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Do you have anything against Mr du Plessis and Mr Raath to falsely implicate them in the acts of torture that you alleged, except of course for the concession that Mr du Plessis made that he punched him some few punches and slaps?  Do you have anything against them to falsely implicate them in acts of torture?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> And that they said Mr Kondile co-operated almost immediately and became an informer, was that a lie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Finally, the son of Mr Kondile is very proud of the gallant effort and stance that his father took but the only thing that he's critical about regarding you, is that after you resigned you could have gone to the Kondile family which was and still is very well known, and told them confidentially what happened Mr Danster, that is the only part that we are critical about, thank you.  Do you have anything to say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Bond, that's my nickname and it looks like you know me.  As you know, at that time it was difficult, you could not - to take information - the men that have lost their lives for trying to get information to the movement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> ...[inaudible] thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NYOKA</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> There is something I would like to say.  I would like to address the family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I'm sure you have waited a long time to hear what happened to Sizwe.  This has been something that has been very heavy on my shoulders, however the truth and lies are not the same.  I would like to apologise to the family.  I did not partake in killing him however, I interrogated him and I ask for forgiveness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Just one more part Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>	Can I ask you to go an apologise to them and shake hands with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can do that a little later on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> All right, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> All right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Booyens, are there any questions you wish to put to this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> I certainly have questions for this witness.  Mr Chairman, I don't know whether Mr Jansen's position ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will ask him just now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BOOYENS:</span> Certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>	Mr Danster, you say you are a builder at present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Right now I'm in jail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> So you're not a builder at present, you're a prisoner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He's a builder by trade or by occupation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> The question was, what is he doing at present M'Lord, he may be a builder by trade - on the premises where he presently is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a>	Let's deal with your transfer from the security police.  The reason for that transfer was because there was a small problem about it being alleged that you were involved in some falsified driving licenses, not so?  That's the reason for your transfer, you were in fact found guilty of an offence like that.  I'm not saying you committed it, I'm just saying you were found guilty and then you were transferred, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> So your transfer from the security police had absolutely nothing to do with your involvement with Mr Kondile, it had something to do with something completely different , is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Let's deal with these cars that you were - the problems with the motor cars and the return from Bloemfontein and so on, I just want to get clarity about that.  You had to borrow a car in Bloemfontein, is that right? - because your P.E. car gave you problems, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Was that a police car with a radio?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And ultimately that Bloemfontein police car was taken back to Bloemfontein and your P.E. car was returned, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> The point is, the five of you - that's including the four policemen and the deceased, travelled down in the Bloemfontein police car to Port Elizabeth, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And this Bloemfontein police car, can you remember how long it stayed here before Bloemfontein came to fetch it or before it was taken back to Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> About a week.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Where was this car, was it at your security headquarters in P.E.? - the Bloemfontein car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I'm not sure, I think it was taken to P.E. where they kept the police cars.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Yes, not the government garage, the police garage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> So it seems to that for that first week at least you were in P.E. because you even know about the movements with the motor car? - your car being returned, the Bloemfontein car being fetched.  So you were not involved with the deceased at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> As the car was taken - we were using a ...[indistinct], there were cars there that could be used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> That's not the point of the question please Mr Danster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> What are you trying to ask me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Just answer my questions, don't tell me what to ask you.  You must have been in P.E. because you know that the Bloemfontein car was taken back after about a week.  You were in P.E., you were not in Jeffrey's Bay, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Okay.  Were you in Jeffrey's Bay right from - well, you came back with the deceased and did you start dealing with the deceased the very next day or two days later, what is the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> It was not too long a time after we'd come back then we continued with the investigation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> That's what I'm asking you, how is not too long a time?  Was it the next day, two days later, a week later, two weeks later, that's what I want to know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> A long while.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> A long while?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I cannot remember the exact time that elapsed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> But the next time you saw the deceased he was in Jeffrey's Bay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Not in Humansdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I saw him in Jeffrey's Bay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Are you aware that according to the documentation, he was detained for - I think it would be correct if I say, for about two weeks in Humansdorp before being transferred to Jeffrey's Bay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I heard that information here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Do you dispute it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> So it very well be that for two weeks you nothing to do with the deceased, the two weeks when he was at Humansdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is not so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> So you did question him at Humansdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> You say you don't dispute that he could have been at Humansdorp for two weeks, you say you didn't question him, then I say: "Was he taken to Jeffrey's Bay and then taken back to Humansdorp"?, what are you trying to say to me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> When I dealt with Sizwe he was in Jeffrey's Bay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Was detained in Jeffrey's Bay as well yes, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And what I'm saying to you is that the records clearly show and there is no imaginable reason, that he was - in fact we've got - the very first entry that we've got indicates that he was at Humansdorp on the - he was detained at Humansdorp on the 10th of July, it's an entry in a Humansdorp occurrence book.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a>	We have yesterday dealt with the warrants and from the warrants it's apparent - the history from the warrants, that he was initially detained in Humansdorp and then he was transferred to Jeffrey's Bay and nobody ever challenged that.  I'm saying to you that he was at Humansdorp for two weeks, are you disputing that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I can't dispute it because it's on the documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> That's right.  Then I'm saying to you, after he was brought from Bloemfontein he was detained at Humansdorp for two weeks, for the first two weeks you obviously had nothing to do with him.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I thought I had told you, the people that had spent more time with Sizwe, they were with him for plus minus 12 weeks, the people I've mentioned already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think we're not making much progress, please.  The question is very simple, whilst he was detained in Humansdorp you had nothing to do with him, that's correct isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I never interrogated him in Humansdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was only after he was brought to Jeffrey's Bay that you got involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> At Jeffrey's Bay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> So again, just for clarity, from the time that you questioned him in Jeffrey's Bay, you are saying you had something to do with him for about 12 weeks?  Is that right or wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, plus minus 12 weeks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Mr Danster, - in fact just to clarity this beyond any doubt, on the - at page 183, it seems that Mr Sizwe Kondile was admitted to the cells and I'm informed - although that doesn't appear from here that this is indeed the Jeffrey's Bay occurrence book, he was admitted to  - and according to the warrants he was admitted to Jeffrey's Bay on the 24th day of July.  So could it be that you started dealing with him on the 24th day of July or shortly after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> After he was in Jeffrey's Bay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Were you aware that according to the Bloemfontein people, he had already given certain information to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I was never told that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Mr du Plessis never told you that he had given Bloemfontein certain information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No, he did not give me such a report, we were just given orders and the questions that we were to ask him and the people that he had to identify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> If you talk about people that he had to identify those of photo identifications, is that correct? - ...[indistinct] in the photo album is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> What was the nature of the questions you had to ask him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He was asked who was in Lesotho, what they were doing there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Did he answer that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> After intensive interrogation he gave us the information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Now let's deal with this intensive interrogation, I don't exactly understand what happened there.  You and Mr Raath initially started questioning him at Jeffrey's Bay, was that now only the two of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct, we were given orders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Yes, by Mr du Plessis you say.  And you were asking questions and the deceased was asked to write down the answers, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Now, did the deceased refuse to answer your questions?  Did he refuse to write anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman, if he could just say in what period he's talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> I asked him the initial period Mr Chairman, I don't think you can get any closer than that, with respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He gave us some information, however it was not the kind of information that the Captain wanted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Did you know that?  Did you know it wasn't the kind of information the Captain wanted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> The Captain told us after he'd read the paper, that it's not the kind of information that he required.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Did you read the papers, the answers that Mr Kondile supplied?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And on a question as to who was in Lesotho, did he write down certain names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And as to what he was doing - I'm talking about the initial period before du Plessis was dissatisfied - let's not have any unclarity about this, and as to a question about they were doing, did he say they were getting training and they were getting political education and that type of thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He would not give us direct answers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Give me an example of the indirect answers he gave, you read the papers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Captain du Plessis wanted to know where the safe houses are, where propaganda machine was made, where the weapons were hidden, who was training the people within South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Well, your answer was he wasn't giving you direct answers, now I want to  - but he wasn't apparently also not refusing to give you answers so he must have been giving you some indirect answers, what sort of answers did he give?  Give me an example so I can understand what you're talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He told us who was involved in training the people within the country and outside the country, who was training them - also educating them politically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And did he tell you where the safe houses were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, after he was intensively interrogated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> So did he refuse to tell you where the safe houses were initially? - you and ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Did he refuse to tell you where the arms caches were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Did you report to du Plessis that the man was refusing to co-operate? - because he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We reported this when the Captain arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> How long was it before you started at Jeffrey's Bay that this assault that you've told us about took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] mention any assaults.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> I'm referring to - Mr Chairman, I'm using the technical word, assaults with the electric shocks and so on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes, rather use torture, he's used torture to describe that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a>	This torture session that you described, how long was it after you went to Jeffrey's Bay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> After he'd refused to give us the desired answers, the group that was going to interrogate him then arrived, the names that I'd already mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> The question is, approximately how long after you'd started interrogating him or questioning him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> It's quite soon after we realised that we were not getting the answers that we wanted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Please Mr Danster, it's a simple question.  You started on a certain day in Jeffrey's Bay to question the man and at a later stage he was tortured, I know - how long was it from the time that you started to question the man in Jeffrey's Bay till this torture took place, that's all I want to know, try and help us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I don't quite know what answer you want.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you say whether it was within a week of your having started questioning, two weeks? - approximately, if you can't be exact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> After a day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> So the very first day it became apparent that he was not co-operating and so the next day the torturers arrived, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Now have you ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Danster, are you sure about your answer now, that it was a day and the next day the torturers arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I can't say it was just one day after we started questioning him.  If you're not getting the answers that you want you're going to make means to get the kind of information that you want.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes, but you just told us it was one day after.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We have no idea, we're not saying that we know when, we want some assistance form you to give us some idea about how long after you had questioned him and got nowhere, did the tortures commence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Plus minus one day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on Mr Booyens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Kondile hasn't informed you at that stage that he had been tortured by anybody prior to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> When did you receive the instruction from Mr du Plessis that you were not to beat the man or as you say: "assault him"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> When we were torturing him, interrogating him, he then gave us an order that we should not kick him, we should not beat him up, we should not bang him against the wall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> This statement you made to the investigator of the TRC, you say you were relying solely on memory, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Is this statement correct and true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> So, would I be correct in saying that you read through it and you were satisfied and that's when you signed it and you took the oath that it was the truth, is that right Mr Danster?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And if there was anything that was incorrect in it or untrue, you would have had it rectified before you signed it - I mean you were at one stage in your career a policemen, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Can you perhaps just for the sake of the record, identify your statement, is that the document appearing from page 42 to page 50 - it's actually signed on page 49 - it be binding on my conscience, I think there's another signature of yours there, I'm not ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Now, I want to try and get some details of this torture session.  The first torture session involved a certain number of people that you mentioned in your evidence in chief, Niewoudt and all those people, do you remember? - du Plessis, Roelofse, Niewoudt, Bezani, Raath and yourself.  Were all of them involved in that first torture session?  Leave the statement alone, I'm talking about your evidence in chief.  Mr Danster, leave the statement alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Leave the statement alone, I'm asking you about your evidence in chief.  The first torture session involved the six people that I have mentioned, du Plessis, Roelofse, Niewoudt, Bezani, Raath and yourself, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And after that torture session, did Mr Kondile co-operate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He gave us information but not all the information that the Captain wanted from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> So there must have been a period of time in-between that and the second torture session, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> When somebody is being interrogated there are breaks, four to five hour breaks and when we get up we would continue with our work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Very well.  Now I want you to describe this first alleged torture session that you say you were involved in, where did it take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> In the office in Jeffrey's Bay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> There was a bed in the office, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, there was a bed in the corner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Was there more than one bed in the corner? - not in the corner, in the room - my mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> There was one bed in the room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Who used to sleep on that bed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Raath would sleep on the bed and we would use sleeping bags on the floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> So you were already staying - the: "we" who would use the sleeping bags on the floor, would that now be you and Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> There were mattresses on the floor and we'd use sleeping bags.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Just listen to my question.  The: "we" that would use the sleeping bags in that room, was that you and Mr Kondile?, that's what I want to know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Sizwe did not sleep in that room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> At no stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No, he would not sleep in that room at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Was he taken back to the cells all the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> For the whole of the 12 weeks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> So if we - you see because according to the occurrence book he was in fact booked out of those cells and allegedly released on the 10th of August 1981.  I say he was ...[indistinct] released because we know by now he was not really released but he was booked out of those cells.  So if we go - if he was there for 12 weeks and we know that he's only been taken to Jeffrey's Bay on the 24th of July, it seems that the prisoner tally in the cells from the 10th of August for the next 9 to 10 weeks will never tally, there will always be one prisoner more in the cells than there are supposed to be, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Please repeat your question, it's not clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Okay, I would like you to comment about this because I think this is something we will have to investigate.  You tell me that you were involved in the interrogation of Mr Kondile for about 12 weeks, that's about three months, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Now if he was taken into custody at Jeffrey's Bay on the 24th of July, that should be August, September, October till round about late October, 24th of October, 20th of October, round about that time, he was still kept in the cells at Jeffrey's Bay, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He was kept in Jeffrey's Bay just before he went to Komatiepoort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> For how many weeks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I was there for plus minus 12 weeks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And that was the time that he was kept in Jeffrey's Bay in the cells.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Right.  Now, the occurrence book at the police station is not written by the security branch, is that right? - it's written by the ordinary uniformed policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And you were a uniformed policeman at some stage in your career, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> You worked at a station, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And if you were on charge office duties at night, it's part of your duties to visit the cells, to see that - of the entries that must be made in the O.B., how many prisoners there are, if there are any complaints, in fact you are supposed to visit them hourly, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> On - if you turn to page 187 - can I just finish this aspect, I'm sorry Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes, Volume 3 - 2?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> If you turn to page 187, you'll se an entry there - your Afrikaans is good enough to read that, entry 630, do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Read it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Can you read that for us?  Read it on the record please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Released:  Kondile: 14/11. Article 6: released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> So, here is an entry on the 10th of August 1981 in the occurrence book written by the uniformed policemen, which indicated that at 10 o'clock that morning he had been released, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Mr Booyens are you sure that that is correct?  Who recorded this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> We don't know, we just know that there's such an entry in the occurrence book.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Sorry.  You put it to him that it was written in by the uniformed policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Yes, I take your point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a>	Let's just put it correctly, there's an entry to the effect that this man was released, in the occurrence book.  We don't know by who because whoever was supposed to sign it didn't do so, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> But we know that according to you he was still kept in the cells because he was only interrogated in the office, for another two and a half months about, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> All I'm suggesting to you is that for the next two and a half months the occurrence book at Jeffrey's Bay will never tally with the number of prisoners and number of people that are supposed to be there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How do we know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> It's logical.  If the man is being kept in the cells but he's been theoretically released, there's one extra prisoner in the cells.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] full record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> I beg your pardon Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is this the full record of the entries relating to ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> No, no, that's what - I'm putting it as a logical consequence of the fact.  If you've got a released prisoner Mr Chairman, he's not in the cell anymore on paper but in real fact he is in the cells then it's a matter of elementary mathematics - which has never been my strong point, that you would always sit with one prisoner too many.  Your books will say there are supposed to be - Pete, Paul and John have been arrested for assault and housebreaking and so and there's supposed to be three prisoners in the cells but there's a fourth one, the man that's been released on the 10th of August.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Unless of course he's there under another name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Well ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can we move on, I don't know whether this is a matter of such great consequence but move on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Mr Chairman, ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think you better put the question that you wish to put to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a>	I'm putting it to you that in fact your estimate - your statement that you interrogated him for 12 weeks is wrong, that he wouldn't have been in the cells at Jeffrey's Bay after the 10th of August 1981.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I was there on that case.  There are people who know I was there, even people in P.E.  It's very easy, there are witnesses, they know I was in Jeffrey's Bay for a long time.  Some of them are still in the police force.  I don't know what it is that you're trying to get at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> I'm not saying you were not at Jeffrey's Bay, I'm saying you were not at Jeffrey's by for as long as you say you were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a>	May this be an appropriate time to take the short adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  We'll take an adjournment at this stage for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Danster, you are still under oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">GINOTRY DANSTER:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a>	Yes, you may proceed Mr Booyens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, it's becoming apparent to us that the entire occurrence book over the period in Jeffrey's Bay will become relevant at some stage.  However, my instructing attorney asked my learned friend Mr Steenkamp, Mr Steenkamp apparently hasn't got it in his possession.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a>	We trust that at least some of the occurrence books must be somewhere in the building because they've been photocopied somewhere but we will deal with that at a later stage.  I would just like to refer to a few aspects about the occurrence book and then ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's move on the ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Move on to something else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To the crucial part of the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Well, this is actually crucial, with respect Mr Chairman, because of the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As to when the actual events occurred is a matter of some sharp difference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> As a uniformed policeman, do you also recall that there's is a thing called a cell register in which all prisoners in police cells must be recorded, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Right.  If you would - we haven't got the cell register but the cell register must balance with the occurrence book, is that correct?  It must also indicate when people are released and so on, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> If you would be so kind to turn to page 186 in Volume 2, just to illustrate to - I knew I could rely on the co-operation of my learned friend Mr Jansen, Mr Chairman.  At the top of page 186 - just to illustrate how an occurrence book works, entry number 621 indicates that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a>"Constable Mooi fed 25 units in the cells with coffee and bread:  25 mugs: no complaints"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a>Now, that is a normal entry that would made when prisoners are fed, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Unit I presume refers to a prisoner.  Then, if you go to entry 623 it appears that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5th line</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a>"Prisoners to court"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a>	And then eight prisoners - and the names are given there, together with - can you perhaps assist us, there is a 14, 13, 1443 and so on, what would that be, would that be the cell register number of what would that be? - on the right hand side of the name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>	You see there is a name, for example: Goodwill Maboti 14/13 and then ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Cell register number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Cell register number?  Okay, thank you.  Then we notice that eight prisoners are taken to court, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> So now there should be 17 prisoners left in the cells? -  Eight minus 25 give me 17, at least approximately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Then the very next entry we've got that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a>"Black man Sizwe Kondile placed in cell by Detective Sergeant Gerber or Sergeant Gerber"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>So now there should be 18 prisoners in the cell, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> You agree.  Then at the top of page 187 we see that there are now 18 prisoners in the cells</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a>"No complaints"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a>18 prisoners in the cells:</p>

<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a>Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> I've been told by my colleague just to go slower, apparently I'm speaking too fast Mr Chairman.  Can we just - I beg your pardon Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a>	On the top of page ...[indistinct] opposite the entry number 625, inter alias the following appears:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a>"18 prisoners in cells with no complaints"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a>Do you see that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Now the figures still tally, is that correct?  17, one is added, that makes it 18 from the previous page, do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Then entry number 630</p>

<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> That illustrates the point that you so kindly explained to us earlier on that in fact your occurrence book must reflect what is going on with the movement of prisoners as well, is that right?  If people go out there must be less prisoners in the cells and so on, is that right?  Do you understand what I'm asking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I understand what you're saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And do you agree with me?</p>

<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, I think you ...[indistinct] your client's version on a different footing rather than based on the entries in cells.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> No, what I'm actually dealing with Mr Chairman, is that the entry in the cell register say that the man was released, that's the important one.  Not just removed from the cells, released - "vry gelaat", and that's the important one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a>	Now, on your version he was never released that's correct, in any case not at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Let me make it easy for you.  We were cooking for ourselves and we would give Sizwe some food and then he would go back to his cell and we'd lock him in there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Yes, I know you said he was kept in the cells.  The point is, can you explain the logic on your version that the man went back to the cells and was apparently detained in the cells - of entry 630.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I want to get away from this entry that we're going around in.  It is very common within the security police, the attorney's here like Mr Nyoka know that.  They would look for people and they would not find him.  The attorney's of the prisoner would be looking for their own prisoner and they would not find him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think that the question of not finding prisoners is a separate issue.  It records here, although this is not counter-signed by anybody, there's just an entry which says that Mr Kondile was released at 10 o'clock on that day.  Now, do you think that that is a genuine entry, do you that that is not a genuine entry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> According to my logic, this is a false entry.  They have written here that he was released and meanwhile he was still in the cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Yes, you see what I don't understand and that's seeing that you are dealing with your logic, but for what purpose he was obviously detained in the cells for at least a further two months, can you think of any purpose why this entry would be made here because he was physically in the cells according to your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I think it is your client that would answer that question for you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Very well, let's leave that.  You see, what I want to put to you is that the reason why this entry was made was to create the impression that the man was released whereas in fact he was taken away to Komatiepoort, that's why this entry was made, it was to get him off the books.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, Mr Booyens, ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I can't answer that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It wasn't purely getting him off the book, it was getting him out of this life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Yes, yes, no that was ultimately the - but he was in the books, he had to be removed from the books and the purpose - he was never released, I'm not saying that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, he can't answer why this is there, he doesn't accept the genuineness of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So I think you can move on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> For how long until Mr Kondile was ultimately - went missing and went to Komatiepoort or when you were told he was going to Komatiepoort, did the torture sessions go on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> As I already said, it was quite a while, a long while.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Well, we have established that on your evidence he would have gone - allegedly gone to Komatiepoort, round about the middle of October.  If we work back from that, how long before going to Komatiepoort did the torture session stop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> A few days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Mr Booyens, could you move back from the mike please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a>	A few days.  So he was tortured at least till about the 15th of October?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> This doctor that kept on visiting the man, did he visit him in the cells or that visited this man, did he visit him in the cells?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He would come to the cells.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And apart from the doctor that visited him, did the Magistrate of Inspector of Detainees visit him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Mr Danster, these interrogation sessions of Mr Kondile, it seems to me the brunt of the interrogation was carried by you and Mr Raath, is that correct? - you did most of the questioning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I have named the people that I was with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Well, did they - I know you've named the - just answer the question.  The majority of the questioning, was that done by you and Mr Raath or was it done by somebody else, what is the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> It was Raath and myself who were with him most of the time, however when we were interrogating him it would be all of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And obviously you and Raath also had to sleep at night, not so?  You couldn't stay awake all the time, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> I know there were occasions when you say Mr Kondile was kept awake but here must have been many occasions when after the day he would be placed in the cell and he would stay there for the evening and you and Raath would go about your business, is that right?  You wouldn't be busy with him, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No, we were booked in Jeffrey's Bay, we had to go through the information we were given.  We would look at the details if he had given us the correct answers then we'd fetch him again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> All I'm suggesting to you is, even you and Raath enthusiastic policemen as you might have been, didn't work 24 hours a day, you also slept?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We would have time to sleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And no human being could be kept awake for 12 weeks non stop, not even Mr Kondile and he wasn't kept awake, he was give occasion to sleep, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I did not say he was kept awake for 12 weeks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> No, I'm just putting it to you ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I did not say that he did not sleep for 12 weeks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> You and Raath then obviously there were times when Kondile was in the cells and the two of you were sleeping, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Why did you and Raath have to stay at Jeffrey's Bay those times that you were not busy with Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> If I'm given instructions to investigate a certain matter about a certain prisoner you would only part with that prisoner only after you'd completed the investigation, that was the procedure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's not talk about general procedure, let's just talk about Mr Kondile.  Why were you and Raath at Jeffrey's Bay? - you said that was on instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> It was on an instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And Jeffrey's Bay I'm instructed, is 70 or 80 kilometres away from Port Elizabeth, is that correct? - it's on the highway.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, it seems so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> You and Raath never took weekends of or anything of that nature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We'd go to Port Elizabeth and come back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> You'd go to Port Elizabeth for weekends, is that right?  Is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We would go and fetch some stuff and come back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And obviously during those periods Mr Kondile most of the time would be in the cells?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We would lock him in the cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Mr Kondile was questioned or interrogated, call it what you like, throughout this period of 12 weeks and ultimately gave his full co-operation insofar as answering the questions is concerned, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> What would happen is that we would interrogate him, get the answers and try to investigate whether he's told us the truth or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Are the people who would investigate whether he's telling you the truth or not, would that be you and Mr Raath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We would take the information that he'd given us and give it to Captain du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> So you didn't do the follow-up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We had the information over to the senior officer, those were the rules.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Well, but be that as it may, towards the latter part of the interrogation Mr Kondile was obviously giving his full co-operation because du Plessis even went so far as to try and enlist his services as an informer, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, he gave us information after a while.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> But the question is, was he so co-operative that there was an attempt to enlist him or to recruit him as an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, there were such efforts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Now, if a man - judging on your own information, if a man is not giving you his co-operation you wouldn't even dream of getting him as an informer, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> If you as a policeman yourself is interrogating somebody, you would only try to get that person to become your informer if you are satisfied that he is giving you his full co-operation.  If he doesn't want to co-operate it will serve no purpose even to try to get him as an informer, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We tried to make him co-operate with us to work for the detective side of the police, he refused.  He said that he would give us the information and after he had given us the information he asked that he be charged, he said he refuses to work with the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> I've heard you say that.  Let's carry on from there.  Now, approximately how long before he was taken to Komatiepoort did these efforts of Mr du Plessis to enlist him as an informer start?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I can't tell you the number of days but it took a bit of time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Yes, it's obviously not something that happened very quickly so he started talking to him quite a while before he went to Komatiepoort - allegedly went to Komatiepoort, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He tried to turn him around but that was not successful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Did you assist in this effort to turn him around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We tried together with Raath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And he kept on giving information but just wouldn't take the final step to become an informer, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, that is correct, he gave us the information but he did not want to work with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Did Mr Kondile eventually or at some stage mention something about an arms cache at Komatiepoort?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We heard from Captain du Plessis on the last days of the interrogation - there was information on some of the papers that he'd written that we'd get some weapons from Komatiepoort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question was, did Mr Kondile tell you about caches of arms in Komatiepoort and I understand your answer to be that it was Mr du Plessis who said that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We did not get that information from Sizwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> But I understood you just now to say that he had written something to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We got this information from Mr du Plessis after the intensive investigation that was made.  He said that we had to take Sizwe to Komatiepoort because that's where we would get the weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> So he never wrote it?  Sizwe Kondile never wrote about a arms cache at Komatiepoort, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Could the witness please repeat the answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> After the investigation Captain du Plessis said that his conclusion is such that we should take Sizwe to Komatiepoort where we would get the weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Danster, I think the question was quite clear.  Did Mr Kondile write something about Komatiepoort? - about arms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Your answer in fact was and you gave the answer up in English, so there can be no question of faulty interpretation here: "in a sense, yes", that's what you said on the answer to the question by Commissioner de Jager.  Now, what is this: "in a sense, yes", what do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> After the investigation the Captain said we must take Sizwe Kondile to Komatiepoort where we would get the weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Just answer my question.  He wrote something: "in a sense, yes" about Komatiepoort, what does it mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Mr Booyens, what do you want from me, what do you want me to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> I want ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's just get this clear, we're not playing with words now.  To your knowledge, did Mr Kondile write on a piece of paper about arms being found or will be found in Komatiepoort?  During interrogation, did Mr Kondile say anything to that effect which was put down in writing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Mr Chairman, I had perceived that Sizwe was going to take us to a place like he took us to Transkei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] talk about perceived.  My question is, from your knowledge did Sizwe Kondile write on a piece of paper, make reference on a piece of paper that there was a cache of arms at Komatiepoort?  Did you see that in writing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I did not see that in writing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All right. You were told by du Plessis that there would be arms in Komatiepoort that you must go and fetch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did he tell you that it was Kondile who told him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, let's get ...[indistinct]</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> ...[inaudible] I want to clear this up Mr Danster.  You were present when he was interrogated by Mr du Plessis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We would have different sessions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> In your presence he never told this to du Plessis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> [no English translation]</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Now, why did you answer when I asked you: "in a sense, yes" he wrote it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Captain du Plessis would not have said we must go to Komatiepoort, meanwhile there was no information leading to Komatiepoort, this is why I answered that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But didn't Mr Kondile give you the notes and you handed it over to Mr du Plessis - about the interrogations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Some of the time we obtained information ourselves but also there were times when Captain du Plessis was there personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Okay, I want to go back to another thing.  Did Mr Kondile sleep in the room where you were sleeping and where the interrogations took place or did he sleep in the cells?</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He slept in a cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Always?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He never slept with us, it would be just the two of us, he would go back to his cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Every night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> All the time that I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And we already know that you were there all the time, now and then you would go to P.E. to fetch things but you would come back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> So, this room occupied by you and Raath, was that in the single quarters or in the barracks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That was an office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Well, it may have been used as an office but was it situation in the same part of the building that the barracks were or don't you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> It was a police station building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Are there barracks at that police station?</p>

<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Are there no policemen that stay on the premises?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> They were working there, they were not staying there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> When before Mr Kondile vanished did you speak to him for the last time?  How long before he vanished approximately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> The week before he left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And was he still co-operating with you people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We would chat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Chat quite normally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We would chat with him normally or ask him questions if we wanted to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And he would reply normally and chat to you normally as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He would go along with us because by then we had got the details that we required.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> No, I accept it was just a question of finalising a few things and getting clarity and so on but the man was - insofar as it's possible, on relatively good terms with you people, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] chatted normally, how much further can you take it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Yes, I think I'm satisfied with the answer.</p>

<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I don't know what Mr Booyens is trying to say, could he clarify his question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> I didn't ask a question, you volunteered something, what did you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I was answering your question.</p>

<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Mr Danster, how many times was Mr Kondile visited by the doctor to your recollection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I saw that old man twice because we would give him tablets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> That the old man had given you to give him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Ja, the question is  ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, the tablets were at the charge office and we'd got to the charge office and get the tablets to give to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Now, let us deal with this special squad or the visit of Dirk Coetzee to be more direct.  Will you go to page 47 of Volume 1 please. Have you got it in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I don't have it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Maybe we can ask your counsel whether he would be so kind to make it available to you.  Have you got it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Would the leader of evidence kindly supply him with a copy of Volume 1?</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Mr Jansen has once again ...[indistinct]</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I've got one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> The last paragraph on page 47 starts with the following</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a>"I was informed late in his detention that there was an anti-terrorist squad coming from Pretoria"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a>Let's stop at that sentence.  What do you mean by: </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a>"late in his detention"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a>Does that mean nearly towards the end?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Can you try and put a time on that, a week, two weeks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I can't put a time to that but it was before I parted with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Yes, obviously.  Mr Danster, what I ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think this happened such a long time ago and this statement was made very recently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> That's the point Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't know what reliance you can place ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Then he should be able to tell us if he said it in his statement, why he said it unless he was relying on memory or on something else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, when he said</p>

<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Late in his detention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a>	Why do you say - if you say:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a>"late in his detention"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a>It means shortly before his release - before he vanished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Before arrangements were made for him to go to Komatiepoort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And you say at - you continue to say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a>"At one stage this happened, two white officers arrived, Kondile was handcuffed to a bed after a severe round of torture"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a>That's what your statements say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Look at page 48.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> He was tied to the bed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> You knew Mr van Rensburg, why not mention that he was the other one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Exactly what I am saying.  Two white officers, the one being van Rensburg and the other one that you later recognised as Dirk Coetzee, why didn't you say - you see, the way this reads it sounds as if you recognised the one at some stage and the other one on this statement we never know who he is.  Why didn't you say that it was van Rensburg? - in your statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Dirk Coetzee came with Mr van Rensburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> That's not what I'm asking you.  Why didn't you say in your statement here that the man that you later recognised as Dirk Coetzee, arrived there with van Rensburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In other words, why haven't you ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> You are going to put me in trouble, you're asking me as if you were there.  You were not part of this investigation, this is nonsense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Well, answer the nonsense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Danster ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question really is, you've omitted to mention Mr van Rensburg being there with Mr Coetzee, is there any reason why you didn't mention Mr van Rensburg, that is the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No, there's no reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Well, if there is no reason then I would like to know - I would expect you to have said: "Dirk Coetzee came there with van Rensburg".</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It also depends on who took the statement and the purpose for taking the statement you know, and the detail that was required from him at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Mr Chairman, ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is common cause that van Rensburg was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> It's not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> In fact van Rensburg's evidence was very clear that he never met Dirk Coetzee at Jeffrey's Bay Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> So the purpose would have been to find out who these two people were - why this statement was taken.  The easiest thing in the world will be to say: "The other one I knew, it was Nick van Rensburg"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can use that as argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I can't answer that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could you kindly tell me, when these two policemen arrived there, did Mr Kondile complain about being tortured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No, he never complained, I'll give you the reason why.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> When you interrogate a prisoner you are told that if you dare complain when an outsider comes in then you will be in trouble, we will ill-treat you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did Mr van Rensburg - if he was the one accompanying Mr Coetzee, ask him whether he was all right, whether everything was all right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> What do you mean, ask who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Ask Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No, he spoke to Captain du Plessis, he did not ask him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did any of them talk to Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No, he did not talk to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Just for the record, you have been sitting in this hearing throughout from Monday, is that correct? - you heard the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And you heard it being put that Coetzee was with van Rensburg when they visited Kondile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Please repeat that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> You heard the question being put that Coetzee was with van Rensburg when they visited Kondile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> No, I did not hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> You didn't hear that, that part you missed.  Did you in fact tell your counsel that van Rensburg was with Coetzee when they came to visit Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Please repeat that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think Mr Booyens, you're going to have difficulty with that, with this line of questioning.  You know, you're going to have difficulty with witnesses on this line of questioning if I may put it, as to why he didn't tell his counsel and so on.  He's not ...[indistinct] in this matter here, he's just been subpoenaed to give evidence.  He sits there as a lay man, I can't imagine him making notes of details of questions that are being asked of witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> No M'Lord, but that's not the point.  The point is, a material aspect is left out of his written statement which now all of a sudden appears in his evidence in chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, you put to him that van Rensburg was never there, isn't that what you're trying to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> I want to know first of all why he didn't mention van Rensburg.  The implication is clearly van Rensburg was never there because van Rensburg said he was never there, that was his evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Yes, you see Mr ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> After Dirk and van Rensburg and van Rensburg arrived, Captain du Plessis was inside with Raath and myself, Dirk was with black people that did not get off the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> But Mr Danster, the one thing that really is still not clear to me, you made this statement, this written statement.  The point that Mr Booyens is making is, when you made this statement you did not mention that Mr van Rensburg arrived with Mr Coetzee and the question is: why not?  That really is what it is - why did you not mention van Rensburg's name in this statement which was made before you gave evidence this morning, that really is what he's asking you.  Can you help him with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Let me help you this way Ma'am.  I gave all the details to the person who took the statement from me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Does that include mentioning Mr van Rensburg's name when you mentioned Dirk Coetzee's name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, I did mention his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Now, why didn't you then earlier on when I asked you whether there was something wrong with the statement when the statement was taken, rectify that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Sorry, Mr Chairman, the fact that he's left out a name doesn't mean the statement is wrong, it just means it is not as fully detailed as it should have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, anyway ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> With respect Mr Chairman, that's not the case because on an answer to the Commissioner's question he said he mentioned it and now we are dealing with a statement that's been recorded incorrectly.  And he told us that he was satisfied with the statement and I think I am entitled to ask him why he didn't complain then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a>	You mentioned somebody's name, the man taking the statement doesn't mention that name, why did you tell him?  Fix it, that's  Nick van Rensburg, add his name.  Have you got an answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Mr Booyens, I can't answer that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Very well then, well leave it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can we move along?</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> The torture sessions, you say that Niewoudt and Roelofse tortured him twice, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, I remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Was that on the same day or on two different days?MR DANSTER:   Two different days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And how many times did du Plessis torture him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I could never count.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Very many times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, a lot of times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And you and Mr Raath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> A lot of times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And Buzani as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Now, was that because Mr Kondile was still not prepared to give his co-operation? - that these many torture occasions took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> As I had already said, there's a particular kind of information that Mr du Plessis wanted, we was struggling to get that information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> But you got it all eventually.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Was that before the trip to the Transkei?</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> And that was before the trip when the policeman was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Please repeat that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What policeman are you talking about, the raid in Umtata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> He mentioned something about the two people getting away from Umtata and then they went to Butterworth M'Lord, that - when my learned friend stopped, I'm just trying to get a time on this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Sorry Mr Booyens, can somebody give a copy of Volume 4 to the witness?  Is it not possible for him to have all of these documents that we refer him to, in front of him?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> You see, the evidence you gave was that these Umtata people were then apparently at the same time that you were in Umtata going to the bank there was this shoot-out at Butterworth and then there was the roadblock where there was also a shooting, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, because that was reported over the radio whilst we were riding in the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Yes.  No, I hear what you say but we are linking something now to a date involving a shoot-out at a police road block and a shooting of policemen at Butterworth.  You in fact starting talking about that in your evidence in chief as well, do you remember that?  That is the same time that you were in the Transkei with Mr Kondile.  You told us that already, you needn't think ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I'm not thinking, I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Yes, and you've already also told me that Mr Kondile was not tortured any further after the visit to the Transkei because then he'd given his co-operation.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We did not stop the investigation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> I'm talking about the torture.  Is that correct, he wasn't  tortured any further after that?  Do you agree, you said that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now just be careful please, you are being reminded it is said that earlier on you said that after this shooting incident, there was no more torture of Mr Kondile, is that correct? - after the time when this incident took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Yes, we cooled off in torturing him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Well, cooled off, I don't know what cooled off in torture means but I presume that means in more plain English that you stopped torturing him, there was no more torture as the Chairman pointed out to you?  That' really what you're trying to say to us, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman, if can interrupt - I apologise to my learned friend, I'm not sure that he testified earlier in fact after they returned from Transkei that the torture had stopped. Sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I think and he says now that they had cooled off.  The question is, did they continue at some stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a>	When you say: "They cooled off torturing after this shooting incident", was Mr Kondile tortured thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> After the cool off period we needed more details from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may have needed a lot more details but the question is, was he tortured in order for you to get those details?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> We did not stop completely torturing him but we would give him breaks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Please explain to me then Mr Danster, why did you tell us you stopped the torture after you went to the Transkei?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> This is what I meant by stopping, we did not continue the way - as intensively as we tortured him previously.  A few days would elapse ...[intervention]</p>

<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I'm sorry if I did not put it that way but what I meant is that a few days would elapse without torturing the man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Well, I think the record will speak for itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> You see, because according to this the shooting incident in the Transkei occurred as early as the 8th of August and I'm sure that it will be very easy to find the official records of that incident as well and reluctant as I am to believe newspapers, I think they might have got that one right.  Then we have a situation on what you've said earlier on, that for two and a half months Mr Kondile was never tortured again. It's not what you say now I know.  Do you want to explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> You are putting words in my mouth, you are talking about things I never uttered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> In fact Mr Booyens, I was going to say that the two and a half months calculated from the time he got to Jeffrey's Bay which was on the 24th of July and we're here talking about a couple of weeks later ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Okay.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Let me be - I take your point Commissioner, you're quite right it's two months and not two and a half.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think that he also said in his evidence that he was tortured until a few days before he was taken to Komatiepoort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> That's quite correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a>	You have also heard the remark by the Commissioner, the Honourable Chairman, that earlier on you said he was tortured, now - we've got many stories from you now Mr Danster and perhaps you would like to explain your way out of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a>	We've got a version that says that Mr Kondile was tortured until a few days before he went to Komatiepoort which according to you was middle October, do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Mr Booyens, are you trying to say that Mr Booyens (Mr Kondile) was never tortured because you're trying to protect your clients?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> I was fortunately never tortured, I can assure you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I was there, you were never there and therefore maybe you can answer that question yourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Just answer the question, I'm dealing with what you said.  You heard what the honourable Commissioner ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I'm not prepared to answer because I have told you that Kondile was tortured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Are you going to refuse to answer any further questions that I put to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Mr Booyens, I don't think that that is what he is saying, he's obviously getting very irritable and irritated.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Well, I would ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The record will speak for itself.  Can you just move on now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Do you want to explain the discrepancies in your evidence that you've heard just now?  Do you want to try and explain them or do you want to leave it at that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR ROUX:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman, in all fairness, if it could just be repeated to him because he can't even remember what the discrepancies were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Danster, maybe it's very confusing for you to sit here with so many legal people, I'm going to try and be of some assistance to you.  We have to determine what the facts are, help us.  The question about the torture of Mr Kondile is a matter of great importance, when it began, how long did it take, when it ended.  These are matters of importance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a>	Now, the question about when did the torture of Mr Kondile end, one of the answers you have given is that it ended a few days before - shortly before he was taken to Komatiepoort.  Another answer that you have given was that torture had ended after the incident that had taken place when you had taken him to Umtata and when people had been shot at about that time.  Do you understand that?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a>	Those are the versions you have given, there might be another version as well.  You've said about the torture cooled off.  Now I'm affording an opportunity to give me your final answer and take your time about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Mr Chairperson, be specific or what is this particular specific question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What must we accept as the final answer as to when did that torture end?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Before he went to Komatiepoort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Booyens, can we move on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> Yes, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a>	Now, insofar as it's relevant - they are not applicants but just to tell you what is being disputed of your evidence, Roelofse and Niewoudt whom I also represent say that they were never involved with Mr Kondile's questioning at all.  You deny that, you don't agree with me?  You were implicated by that also not involved in torture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> Is that you and them telling that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He, on behalf of Roelofse and Niewoudt, he is instructed to put to you that their version is that they didn't torture and you ...[indistinct]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> They were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> They were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> You heard the evidence of Mr du Plessis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> In fact that's all he admits what he did insofar as torturer or call it what you like, is concerned - goes as far as Mr Kondile is concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR DANSTER:</span> I heard him but he didn't tell, he just said that they killed him, they burnt his body, he didn't explain more, he didn't elaborate more about the stages of interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOOYENS:</span> That's not entirely correct.  He in fact said that at the beginning Mr Kondile was reluctant to co-operate and he hit him with an open hand and hit him with a fist and there might even have been a second occasion when he did that.  So he admits</p>
