            "Firstly, Mr Commissioner, as I say I've been instructed to place this on record, more particularly since yesterday at 5 o'clock an incorrect media report was transmitted on the radio, to suggest that the issue of the venue has been settled, that the parties have agreed to move the venue to Athlone Technikon Centre.  Now that report was incorrect.  We don't know how that report got to the media, more particularly since the hearings were in chambers where there was no media present, but as we all know that report was incorrect, no decision was taken.\n\tFor the record, Mr Commissioner, my instructions are, and they remain, my client will not consent to altering the venue.  My client's instructions are as follows.  The Commission has made a decision on the venue.  The decision was taken.  The venue was originally Adderley Street.  That was pursuant to a Court Order.  There is a Court Order that stands in respect of the venue.  What is important, Mr Commissioner, is that this venue was not selected by my client per se, he did not suggest this venue.  This venue was given to us by the Commission.  Hence the Commission made a decision on the venue.  Hence the issue of the venue has been determined and that issue is finalised.  \n\tIf of course certain parties feel aggrieved by the decision to hold the hearings here, then obviously, Mr Commissioner, the aggrieved party can do what my client did.  They have the rights of recourse to a court of law and if they do feel aggrieved for whatever reasons, if they feel they've been unjustly treated, unfairly treated in the Commission selecting this venue by consensus, because we stress a venue had been selected.  More particularly, Mr Commissioner, because in terms of the Act, the Act provides that the Commission is to notify the venue for the holding of hearings and the time for the holding of such hearings.  That decision has now been taken and the venue is - this is the venue.\n\tMr Commissioner, I do not want to - the whole issue of the venue has been fully ventilated in these proceedings, in a court of law, fully opposed proceedings.  Now if certain parties believe that they are aggrieved, for whatever reason, we feel this venue is accessible to all concerned.  The Act does not stipulate or make it mandatory for the venue to be selected to be in Athlone.  What the Act does stipulate is that the proceedings, subject to certain exceptions, must be open to the public.  Well these proceedings are open to the public.  The Commission and all parties concerned, are aware of my client's concerns as to the venue in Athlone, which I do not want to rehash and waste the Commission's time.  \n\tHence, Mr Commissioner, in the light of a Court Order, in the light of the Commission's own decision to hold the hearings here, my client objects to altering the venue.  And should the Commission, in the face of a Court Order, in the face of its own decision to select this venue, now unilaterally wish to change this venue, it's our submission, Mr Commissioner, that the Commissioner will be acting grossly improperly and irregularly and in so doing, having knowledge of my client's concern about Athlone, it would in effect unfairly be preventing my client from continuing to participate in these proceedings.  This would also be a violation of my client's rights and addition, it is obvious that this could prove extremely, extremely prejudicial to my client.  \n\tSo, Mr Commissioner, in those circumstances my client does not consent to the altering of the venue, and I've been instructed that all his rights on this issue are reserved, and we would hope that at these hearings this is the last word said, that we can get on with the business at hand, that the Commission's been mandated to do, that's to deal with the amnesty and not the issue of the venue, since it's been decided, more particularly since the Commission we appreciate, has a very limited time span and my client would like to get these proceedings over and done with and participate in them freely and securely and safely.  Thank you, Mr Commissioner.",

I received information that Omar had had a heart attack and that he was at home, which had jeopardised the project.  Barnard proposed that the project with regard to Omar, be postponed for a few weeks.\n\t\t\tI contacted Peaches on the instruction of the Regional Manager, to find out whether he was able to obtain some of Omar's pills and he told me that he would try that.  I discussed the matter of the pills with the Regional Manager, in the presence of the Co-ordinator, Nick Botha and Chappie Maree.  There was another person present whose name I cannot recall, but who had been previously in a medial regiment of the Defence Force.  He was responsible for the obtaining of logistical support.  In others words he would assist with the tablets.  I mentioned that endeavours would be made to obtain a pill of Omar and then was told by the Regional Manager to hand over the pill to the unknown person who was present.  He said that they would manufacture a similar pill which looks exactly like the pill which was given to him and that Omar would die of a heart attack after he had taken it.  \n\t\t\tThe Regional Manager said that he would discuss the matter with the Chairperson, via the Managing, as an approved project had already existed.  I received instructions from the Regional Manager to continue with the project and to try and find the tablet.  Shortly afterwards, during August of 1989, I received two small white tablets from Peaches.  I was informed that those were the tablets that Omar drank for his heart condition.\n\t\t\tI, during a cell meeting, gave the tablets to the person attached to the Medical Regiment, in a hotel room.  I can't recall who all was present during this meeting.\"",

On the same day I flew back to Jo'burg.\n\t\t\tLater I met Botha and Nick in a hotel at the airport where I gave R10 000 back to Nick.  The R10 000 was related to the Omar project.  Nick then gave me a white-coloured powder in a small bottle.  Nick told me that the powder came from the Regional Manager and that it had to be sprinkled over Omar's food because they could not manufacture the pills.  The powder would also give Omar a heart attack.  I took it and then went back to the Cape.\n\t\t\tOn the same day I met Peaches at the DF Malan Airport and I gave him the bottle, with the instruction to sprinkle the content thereof over Omar's food.\"\nNow this meeting with Barnard and Peaches, they're both present at the same meeting, is that correct?",

He would be robbed at knife-point and I was told to organise with Peaches to come to Jo'burg from the Cape and also to bring a person with him, in order to execute the project.  Peaches came to Jo'burg and I spoke to him in a hotel and I told him that Evans would be the target of the project.  The project was not my project, but the project of Maree, and he continued with the project.  I gave Peaches  R2 000 in cash to cover their costs.  It was agreed that Peaches would receive R5 000 to execute the project.  Later it appeared that the information regarding the address of Evans was not correct and that he could not be found.  I conveyed this to the Managing Director and he said that the project could not continue.  The project was then halted.\"",

I called the number, it was at the Millpark Holiday Inn.  Staal Burger told me that I had to go and see him immediately.  I then saw Staal Burger in a room at the hotel at approximately half past one.  I then met Christo Britz and Joe Verster at the same hotel room. I think it was a Wednesday.  Joe Verster told me that Anton Lubowski would the coming Saturday be awaited in Cape Town.  I did not know him.  I was then informed that Christo Britz would inform me as to where Lubowski would make two speeches, namely one in Johannesburg and one in Cape Town, and my instruction from Joe Verster was to monitor Peaches (which is actually incorrect, it has to be Lubowski), to monitor him during his visit to the Republic of South Africa.  He had to obtain information with regard to persons with whom Lubowski made contact and places he visited.  The following day, I think it was a meeting next to the road close to Halfway House, Christo Britz had a picture of Lubowski as well as the place where he would give his speech.  He supplied me with the place where Lubowski would make his speech, it was Johannesburg Country Club, in Auckland Park.  Particulars were handed to me in written form.  At this stage I cannot recall whether a project was proposed or submitted.  The hotel's name in Cape Town I cannot recall.  \"Ek het 'n aansoek om voorskot uitgemaak en aan Christo Britz oorhandig.\"  It was also approved by Staal Burger.  I cannot recall the amount.  The cash was received from Christo Britz.  The following day I did not trust Peaches and paged Ferdi Barnard and had a meeting with Ferdi Barnard in Florida, close to Checkers parking area.  Ferdi Barnard then agreed to monitor Anton Lubowski during his visit in South Africa.  The particulars, the photo and the cash amount was handed over to Ferdi Barnard there.

There I met the Regional Manager, Nick, and the person from the Medical Regiment in the room.  The Regional Manager told me that the project concerning the Early Learning Centre had been approved and that the Managing Director let him know that if one more bomb was activated by the Kewtown Youth Movement, he would see it as my fault.  The Regional Manager then informed me that the Co-ordinator was on his way with the limpet mine, and after approximately three-quarters of an hour the Co-ordinator arrived at the hotel, with the limpet mine packed in a cardboard box.  The limpet mine with a remote control, was shown to me and he demonstrated the working of it.  The limpet mine was a great big grey Russian fabricated limpet mine, while the detonation mechanism was a pocket calculator with an aerial.  The calculator would detonate the bomb by pressing the minus button.  I have never worked with explosives and I was worried that life loss could result and I was also worried because I was not an expert in this field.  I then requested the Regional Manager and the Co-ordinator for help and I suggested that Botha would accompany me to the Cape to handle the bomb because he had knowledge of explosives.  The Regional Manager agreed and paged Botha, upon which Botha arrived at the hotel and the working of the limpet mine was explained to him by the Co-ordinator.  Botha agreed to help with the project and the necessary arrangements were made.\"",

One day I received an urgent message on my blue pager to contact Burger at the Protea Gardens Hotel.  Upon my arrival there, Burger, Maree and van Zyl were there.  There were also two unknown persons who were introduced to me as Nick, the new Admin man, and Theo, the Intelligence Officer.  Christo was also there.  I received instruction to accompany van Zyl to Cape Town by car.  Still in the room they showed me a remote control device which we tested there.  The instruction was that van Zyl and I had to transport a package to Cape Town.  We departed for Cape Town the very same evening and knew that it was explosives that we had to transport.  It was said to me by Burger that it was a project of van Zyl and that it was approved by the Chairperson.  On our way van Zyl told me that the package would be handed over to Isgak.  Overnight we arrived at his brother-in-law's flat.  Isgak was contacted to fetch the package the evening.  The following day we met Isgak at the airport.  The package was handed over to him.  He handed over two packages to Isgak.  The one contained the bomb and the one was empty.  I knew that there was a Coloured woman who had to place this bomb in the hall.  The empty bag was for in the event of someone asking her where her bag was, then she would be able to present the empty bag.

The remote control I had in my attache case.  On the 31st of August 1989, we arrived in the Cape.  We then slept for approximately four hours and after I awoke, I contacted Isgak and told him to meet me that afternoon at the parking area of DF Malan airport, where I would hand over the limpet mine to him.  In the afternoon I met Isgak at the airport and Botha prepared the limpet mine.  Thereafter the bag in which the limpet mine was placed was placed in the boot of Isgak's vehicle and I gave the following instruction to Isgak.  He had to take the bag with the bomb and place it in a cupboard in the hall in the Early Learning Centre.  The instruction was that Isgak would go directly from the airport and place it in the hall and that the bomb would be activated later that evening after all persons had vacated the premises.  After the placing of the limpet mine he had to return tot he airport to confirm that he had executed his instructions.  The remote control calculator I kept in my possession and I instructed Isgak to meet us at the Bellville Holiday Inn at seven that evening.  At the airport, after Isgak had departed, I informed the Regional Manager that the bomb had been placed and he informed me that the Managing Director would be informed.  At the same time I arranged with the Regional Manager that he would meet us at Jan Smuts airport on the 1st of September 1989, at 01H00.  I planned to go on leave and the evening of the 1st of September 1989, I would go along with my spouse and leave my vehicle at the airport and I would spend two weeks in the Cape on holiday.  Through the course of the afternoon I decided that the remote control device would not be handed over to Isgak.  I was concerned about the fact that he could have placed the mine at any other place than the Early Learning Centre and it could be activated at a place and time of his choice.  I discussed this with Botha and we decided that we would go along to ascertain that the bomb be placed in the correct place.  The evening of the 31st of August 1989, Isgak met Botha and I at the Holiday Inn at 7 o'clock.  We went together in a vehicle to the Early Learning Centre and at approximately a quarter to eight we arrived at the Early Learning Centre.  Isgak pointed out the area there as well as the vehicles of members of the organisation.  Approximately 400m away from the Early Learning Centre we parked and it was already dark.  I sent Isgak into this hall to ensure that the children were out of the hall, because that evening there was a karate class for children.  He had to determine which members of the movement attended the meeting.\"",
