<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  May I beg leave to call Capt Mentz?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS CALLS</p>

<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>EXAMINATION BY ADV DU PLESSIS:  Capt Mentz, on page 68 the </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>application starts.  You say the period was between 1989 and </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>1992, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Could you give a closer date for us, could </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	75	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Unfortunately not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  On page 69 you started with the explanation </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>of this incident, and could you please start with the first </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Instructions were given that an operation in </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>Botswana had to be carried out.  The purpose of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>operation was to eliminate a business just across the border </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>in Botswana and a shop as well.  There was also a house.  It </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>was used as a shelter for terrorists.  It was used as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>shelter for terrorists crossing the border, and it was used </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>as a contact point where information and messages were </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>passed on and help and assistance given to terrorists on </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>their way to the Republic of South Africa or were returning </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>from the Republic.  We expected to find at this house some </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>terrorists there who would be overnighting there.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>target would be eliminated due to the fact that it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>necessary to prevent the passage of terrorists across the </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>border.  These terrorists, were at that stage, responsible </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>for handgrenade explosions, landmine explosions, death of </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>innocent civilians and also other acts of terror.   I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>not told anything else and it must be remembered that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>acted on the instructions of my commanding officers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Capt Mentz, the persons using this </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>particular house, the terrorists, do you know where they </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>crossed the border normally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Across the border-line not through any official </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>border post where you have to show their passport, they just </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>jumped the fence, as we called it.  There wasn't a very high </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>or electrified fence, it was simply a farm fence and there </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>was a river and on the RSA side there was just an ordinary </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>fence.  And they used secret routes there. </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	76	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  You say it was used as shelter and </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>accommodation for terrorists crossing the border, this </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>particular contact house. Is your information that </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>terrorists were often to be found in that house before they </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>crossed the border?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Could you continue, please, the third </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  The persons involved in the operation were Col </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>Eugene de Kock who was in command.  He was the senior </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>officer there.  The other officers were Lieut Marthinus Ras </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>Jnr - Gen Ras' son.  He obtained the information and liaised </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>with the local security branch in Zeerust, as well as the </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>rest of the Western Transvaal area.  We also had with us </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>Willie Nortje, Chappies Klopper, Marthinus Ras, as I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>mentioned, Warrant Officer Louw van Niekerk, Charlie Chait </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>and I later remembered other names:  Douw Willemse, Dragon </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>Andronowitz, Dawid Brits, Lionel Snyman, Snor Vermeulen, </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>John Taite.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Could you please repeat those names, </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>slowly, because these people have not been notified.  It is </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>only brought to our attention now and you perhaps have their </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>addresses or know where they could be found.  Could you </p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>please tell the Committee that, so that they can be </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>notified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Certainly, Chairperson.  I will repeat the </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>names.  Douw Willemse, Dragon Andronowitz, Dawid Brits, </p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>Lionel Snyman, Snor Vermeulen, John Taite.  These persons </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>are all witnesses for the Attorney-General, except for, as </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>far as I am concerned, John Taite.  John Taite lives in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>area of Knysna or George, I don't have a specific address.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	77	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>The rest, as far as I know, are all witnesses for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>Attorney-General.  And then there were other people who were </p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>involved, but I can't remember their names specifically and </p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>I don't want to mention a name if I am not sure of his </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>involvement, but there were two or three other people </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>involved as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Capt Mentz, before we turn to the next </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>page, were you involved in the planning of this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  At no stage, Chairperson.  I was at Vlakplaas. </p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a> I was a junior there.  And as I have said earlier, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>received instructions - when I received instructions I did </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>not doubt these instructions and the way in which Eugene de </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>Kock had contact with the police and security head offices, </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>I had no doubt that these instructions came right from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>top, via him.  When I say from the top I mean senior </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>generals and officers in the security police.  And I didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>call them into question, the instructions. </p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  How did you see your involvement in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>operation relating to the political situation in the country </p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  The way I saw it, was that we were fighting the </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>ANC, PAC and other liberation organisations with every means </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>at our disposal.  We wanted to eliminate these people and it </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>was important for us that the operation should be </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>successful, seeing that this particular complex was quite </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>close to the border in Botswana, and terrorists had easy </p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>routes, easy access to and from the Republic of South Africa </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>and they also received further instructions, help and </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>weapons there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Captain, whom did you expect to find in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>house?  You yourself, I am not talking about the planning of </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	78	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>the operation, but that night when you went out, what or who </p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>did you expect to find in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  The person whose business and home it was, as </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>well as terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Please continue, page 70.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  I just want to add something here.  I earlier </p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>testified that I was at no stage involved in the planning of </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>the operation or the identifying of this place, but if I </p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>remember correctly, I and Willie Nortje went to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>technical branch, Pretoria, just before the operation and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>there obtained Scorpion weapons with silencers.  These were </p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>prepared for us there and I waited in the car.  He brought </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>the weapons out in boxes, cardboard boxes.  I helped him to </p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>transport these to Vlakplaas.  It was only at a later stage </p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>that I found these weapons at a particular farm. So I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>involved in the transporting of the weapons from security </p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>technical to Vlakplaas.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>	We left from Vlakplaas with quite a few vehicles in a </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>convoy to a farm near the Botswana border.  The farmhouse </p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>was deserted. I don't know whom it belonged to.  So we went </p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>to this farm near the Botswana border and slept in an empty </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>house that night.  The next day we all obtained weapons, </p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>these specific weapons.  Some of these weapons issued to us, </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>were inter alia, Scorpions fitted with silencers.  I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>saying inter alia Scorpions, if I remember correctly, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>only had Scorpion weapons.  On that same day the weapons </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>were tested at that deserted farmhouse just to check that </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>they were in good working order.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>	The same night, the same evening we went to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>Botswana border, where we drove along various dirt roads. I </p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>am not exactly sure of where the place was, and we walked </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	79	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>through the veld.  And we waited at a particular place until </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>about one o'clock in the morning.  We were all dressed in </p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>dark clothes.  It wasn't camouflage type of uniform or </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>clothes, it was just dark denim clothes and sweaters.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>	I then heard that the person whose house and business </p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>it was, was one Mr Kahn.  Later that night we crossed the </p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>river.  There is a specific place where a type of a wall had </p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>been built and we crossed there.  I had heard that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>were crocodiles in the river.  I was part of the so-called </p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>back-up team, Andre Andronowitz and myself.  We walked right </p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>at the back.  But at that particular place where we crossed </p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>the river, Eugene de Kock first waited for us all to cross </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>and then he crossed, and then he passed us again.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>	I was at the back the whole time to make sure that </p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>nobody was following us or pursuing us or that nobody saw </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>us.  Near the business premises and home, which was fenced </p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>around completely, and there was a type of an incline there, </p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>I couldn't see exactly what happened, but Col De Kock - I </p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>can't remember which leg it was, but he tore the ligament in </p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>his knee, near the shop, and after that he had to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>carried.	If I remember correctly, Louw van Niekerk and Douw </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>Willemse stayed with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>	I entered a gate and I think on the left-hand side </p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>there was a black shack, asbestos shack, but they told me </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>that the night watchman was there.  I went past this place </p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>and after having passed the shack I heard the night watchman </p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>coming out.  He must have heard something.  He was shot </p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>there several times.  He shouted - I can't remember who shot </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>him, it was very dark and I had already passed that point.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>	I was inside the premises to perform security and </p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>defence functions there and I went to the shop to see if </p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	80	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>there were any people there.  The shop is on the left-hand </p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>side. I went around it and I was between the outside fence </p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>and the shop on the premises.  The direction which I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>facing was back towards the border of South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>	From the members went into the house next to the shop </p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>and people were shot.  The people, I think Marthinus Ras </p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>Jnr, he was in the house, he went into the house. I think </p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>Willie Nortje as well and others.  I can't remember exactly </p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>who, but I am virtually certain of these two.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>	I later heard that an Indian man, his wife and two </p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>children had been killed in this operation or died in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>operation.  They were sleeping. They were shot, explosives </p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>were placed in the house. </p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>	Yes, Willie Nortje now works for National Intelligence. </p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a> He is also a State witness and he was one of the people who </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>went into the house.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>	Whilst after we had moved away from the house for some </p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>distance the house exploded, was blown-up.  The explosion </p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>took place whilst we were already moving back towards the </p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>border.  Nobody knew - when I say nobody I mean Lieut Ras, </p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>Marthinus Ras Jnr, he knew who was inside the house.  It was </p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>his information and the security branch Zeerust.  It was </p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>information I didn't know.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>	Specifically who were in the house - the instructions </p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>were that the residents had to be eliminated because there </p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>might be terrorists in the house.  There was no information </p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>available beforehand that there would be children in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>house and nobody expected any children in the house.  If I </p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>had known that children would be shot dead I would probably </p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>have had a problem to continue with the operation.  But I </p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>would like to add here that I would still have gone along </p>

<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	81	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>with the operation, I wouldn't have taken place in cross-</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>border operations after being told that children could </p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>possibly be killed.  I would have had a problem with that, </p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>but I wouldn't have told De Kock and them no, I am not going </p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  What effect would that have had if you had </p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>told them no, you weren't going to go with them, that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>refuse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Well, in the first place I already knew of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>cross-border operation which was to take place.  I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>know what they would have done with me, but they could have </p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>eliminated me, because perhaps I had become a risk through </p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>knowing too much or they could have transferred me. But I </p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>would have been worked out of Vlakplaas. </p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>	If I can describe it like this:  such as a platoon </p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>which had to march, and if you take out the marker or a </p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>specific person then the platoon is no longer functional, it </p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>doesn't have sufficient people.  So I just went along with </p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>the stream.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>	I personally would not have shot an innocent child </p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>there, but as I have already testified, I didn't go into the </p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>dwelling house. I was just securing the area around the </p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>house.  I would have gone along in a group context, as I </p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>have already said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>	I still have a problem with this operation, I think </p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>about the children who were shot, and I don't live </p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>comfortably with this fact. </p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>	If I could put it this way; it won't comfort me in any </p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>way, but at that time I tried to deal with this, and I told </p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>myself that the Defence Force did aerial raids across the </p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>borders, also on foot, and there were other operations as </p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	82	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>well where innocent civilians were killed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>	Furthermore, the terrorists planted bombs in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>Republic, landmines as well, and children and innocent </p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>civilians were also killed in those incidents, and that is </p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>the way in which I tried to deal with this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>	As I have already testified, Vlakplaas was the military </p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>wing of the security police, of the South African Police for </p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>the government of the day, the National Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  And Vlakplaas was called in to perform </p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>precisely these sort of operations?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That's correct.	When we left the premises, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>was once again part of the back-up team. I can remember that </p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>we struggled to carry De Kock because he was a big man.  So </p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>we progressed quite slowly.  Andronovitch I once again </p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>walked quite fast or slow jog and we kept looking back </p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>towards the Kahn house. I can remember that there were other </p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>lights close to this particular place, and I thought that </p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>this must be a little village or something.  We had to check </p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>that we weren't being followed or that somebody close to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>premises had seen or heard us.  That is what I meant when I </p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>said I was part of the back-up team on our way back. </p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a>	We once again crossed the river to the vehicles.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>had already reached the vehicles when the place was blown </p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>up.  As I said we were already in the Republic at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>	We then went back to the farmhouse, from which we were </p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>operating.  After which we packed our stuff and early the </p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>next morning - I remember we didn't sleep.  Early the next  </p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>morning we drove to Richards Bay to constitute an alibi for </p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>us.  Col De Kock was lying on the back seat because his leg</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	83	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>was injured.  I drove the vehicle.  I think we bandaged his </p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>leg but he didn't get any medical treatment for his leg.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>just drove to Richards Bay with him in that condition.  In </p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a>Richards Bay there were other members that had already </p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>booked places and made arrangements and preparations for our </p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>accommodation.  This was under the command of Warrant </p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>Officer Piet Botha.  He is now Capt Piet Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a>	They rented rooms for us and they would have done </p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>things to our beds to make the cleaners believe that we had </p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>actually slept in the bed.  As I have said, that was to have </p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>an alibi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>	As I saw the operation it was essential to eliminate </p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>this passage used by terrorists. I gave no orders and I only </p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>acted on instructions and orders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>	The persons who were killed, four persons, including </p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>the two children.  The names of the persons are unknown to </p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>me.  As far as I can remember it was the Kahn family and </p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>their house had been blown up.   It was only the home which </p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>had been blown up, not the shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Capt Mentz, general motivation on page 74 </p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>to page - top of page 81, do you confirm the correctness of </p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>that?  On page 81, the second paragraph, you explain the </p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>political motivation.  Can you just read that for us, </p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>please, the motive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  The motive in which I acted was in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>execution of my orders. It was also for the protection of </p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>innocent people and elimination of activists.  This was </p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>necessary in the light of the war that was raging then.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>This incident happened during the political unrest during </p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>that period.  The whole land was burning. There were all </p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>sorts of problems, arson and other crimes that were </p>

<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	84	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>committed in the name of the liberation movements against </p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>the State and the destabilisation of the State.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  The next page, page 82 at the top.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  The aim was as explained above, because </p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>liberation movements acted against the State and to resist </p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>their actions of overthrowing the State.  It was also </p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a>against activists.  It would frighten them to act actively. </p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>I also at all times acted under the command of De Kock.  As </p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>I have already said, Capt Ras Jnr, it was his information </p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>and his co-ordination.  He will also come and testify to </p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>that extent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>	The elimination of the activists and the safe house was </p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>necessary in the light of the fact that the activists were </p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>involved in serious acts of terror. It was necessary to </p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>eliminate these activists to stabilise society.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>	It was furthermore necessary to protect the lives of </p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>innocent people, black and white.  It was impossible at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a>stage to neutralise activists completely by ways of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>Security Act or normal police action. It was imperative to </p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>act preventatively in foreign countries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  On page 83, you are asked an explanation or </p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>your explanation regarding financial gain.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Quite a while after the operation, I will say </p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>approximately three or four weeks afterwards, Willie Nortje </p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>came to me and handed me an envelope, all the other people </p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>involved also received such an envelope.  If I can remember </p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>correctly, there was R6 000,00 in that envelope.  He said </p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a>that it was for that operation and that the main branch </p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>congratulated us on it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>	I regarded that as a reward for that specific operation </p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>and for the reason that at that stage the National Party, </p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a>85	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>the Government of the day would not officially have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>able to give us medals for bravery for over border </p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a>operations and so on.  We saw that we were not receiving </p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a>medals for it but they gave us monetary rewards.  That was </p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a>the first and the last time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  What bravery was there in shooting four </p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>civilians who were asleep, that you thought you deserved a </p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>medal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, I did not expect a medal, it was an </p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a>over-border operation, in a different country, which was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>enemy of the National Party, the Government of the day. If </p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>we were caught there by the Army of Botswana or the police </p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>or terrorists, they would have shot us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Was Botswana the enemy of South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  You've just said so, you said a foreign </p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>country that was an enemy of the government of the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, Mr Chair, then I would like to correct </p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>that.  They supported the enemies of the South African </p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>Government in housing these terrorists.  They allowed these </p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>people to use their country for operations against the South </p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a>African Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Capt Mentz, were you told anything </p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>beforehand with regards to extra remuneration?</p>

<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Was the payment at all a motive for your </p>

<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Alright.  What did you think about this </p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a>when you were paid for the operation, with regards to the </p>

<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>accomplished by this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  It was their way of, in the first place, </p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a>showing us that it had been an approved main office </p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>operation, and that they wanted to thank us in this way for </p>

<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, Mr Chair, it was cash in a sealed brown </p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>envelope.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Given to you by one of the people who had </p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a>participated in the operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is correct, Mr Chair, Willie Nortje.  For </p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>example, we never stood in a long queue to receive our </p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>envelopes.  We were called to the side one by one.  I, for </p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>example, had to go to Nortje's office.  He closed the door </p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>and then he gave the envelope to me, but I know that other </p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>people also received money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Are you finished?</p>

<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Mr Mpshe, have the relations of the victims </p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>been notified in this case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chairman, no.  Mr Chairman, attempts were </p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a>made to trace the relations, Mr Chairman, and the only thing </p>

<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>ADV MPSHE	87	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>that I could lay my hands on was the Sowetan newspaper </p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a>report, wherein this Kahn family was reported about by a </p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>person who was a - by a Black woman who was working for </p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>them, and at that time she made a report when she was in </p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a>Botswana. I could not make any traces as to families in </p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>Botswana. It was only a report in the newspaper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Did you enquire from the Government and other </p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>such things?  If they owned a shop, a large shop, we are </p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>told, somebody presumably wound up the estate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>ADV MPSHE:  I did not make enquiries in the Botswana </p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>Government, but I am making enquiries with the ANC desk and </p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>they did not have any particulars about the Kahn family, </p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a>save they also referred me to the World newspaper report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Yes, I am not asking that.  Surely when </p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a>somebody dies like this, who owns property, the estate would </p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a>have been wound up and there would be a record kept in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a>relevant department as to what had been done with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a>assets; had that been paid to members of the family, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a>would have got the names of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Yes, that may be so, but I did not make any </p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>enquiries with the Botswana Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Are there any questions you would like to put, </p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a>Mr Mpshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV MPSHE:  Yes, sir.  Was it necessary </p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a>for the night watchman to be killed?  In other words was it </p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a>not possible for him just to be caught and bound and put </p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a>back into his shack and go on with the operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, I was not involved in that.  I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a>even know who shot the man, but I can remember that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a>screamed and that he was then shot.  They wanted to silence </p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a>him to prevent him from warning other terrorists who might </p>

<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a>ADV MPSHE	88	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a>have been in the house.  The persons who shot him had to act </p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a>quickly to silence him.  I don't even know if he possibly </p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a>helped ANC freedom fighters or terrorists. I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a>ADV MPSHE:  You said in your application that you wouldn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a>have killed the children yourself.  Am I understanding you </p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a>to be saying that the death of these two children was </p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a>uncalled for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  If De Kock or Marthinus Ras had told me </p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a>beforehand that there were going to be children in the house </p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a>and that we were going to shoot them, and if he told me I </p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>had to do it, I would have told them I won't.  But as I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>testified I would still have gone with.  I am sorry about </p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>these children who were shot.  I don't know, I don't even </p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a>know how old they were. I also don't know whether or not </p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a>they gave the terrorists staying over there that night, if </p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>they gave them food. I didn't know anything beforehand, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a>as I have already said if they had told me that I was to </p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a>shoot those children I would not have done it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Are you telling us that the killing of these </p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a>children was uncalled for, according to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, that is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Are you also asking for amnesty as far as the </p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a>death of the two children is concerned, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is correct.  Because after I had heard </p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a>that there were children in the house, and that was after we </p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>had crossed the border again, after we were back at our </p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a>vehicles in the Republic, we were talking about who did </p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a>what.  I just heard that the children were sleeping. Up to </p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a>today I do not know how old they were.  I do have a problem </p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a>with that but I apply for amnesty for them.  Because </p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a>afterwards we all know the law.  I associated myself with </p>

<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a>ADV MPSHE	89	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a>their death and therefore I am as guilty as the person who </p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>shot them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Now if you are asking for amnesty in respect of </p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a>the death of these two children, what political motivation </p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a>do you attach to the death of the two children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  As I have said, they could have favoured </p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a>liberation movements, they could have helped these people, </p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a>given them food.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  They might three and four years old, as far </p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>as you knew, how can you make speculations like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a>JUDGE MALL:  I honestly think that you should avoid </p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a>speculating to that extent.  You have no idea as to whether </p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a>they were infants or what.  I think the answer should really </p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a>be just exactly what you know and not what your conjecture </p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a>is, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  Mr Mentz, were you advised at any stage of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a>ages of the children concerned when you discussed the </p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a>incident?  On your way back you were told that the children </p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>had been killed.  Were their ages indicated to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Did you bother to ask to see whether they </p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a>might have participated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  I never asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a>ADV MPSHE:  May I continue, Mr Chairman?  Thank you. I </p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a>haven't heard the answer to my question.  What political </p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a>motivation do you attach to the death of the two children, </p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a>if you were "vereenselwig" yourself with what the people </p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a>did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, this home belonged to their father, </p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a>Mr Kahn.  This house was used for terrorists.  The children, </p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a>I can't speculate, but they were under the influence of </p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a>ADV MPSHE	90	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a>their parents.  It doesn't matter how old they were, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a>were part of the operation.  Their house was blown up.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a>aim was to destroy this place, as I have said, to eliminate </p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a>terrorists and to prevent them from using this as an</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a>entrance route, and that is why they were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a>ADV MPSHE:  I won't pursue that because you are again </p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a>speculating as to what you think was the position.  Let us </p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a>go back to the Kahn family, the husband and the wife.  Were </p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a>they labelled or were they investigated and proved as being </p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a>activists in Botswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  As I have already said, they were - it was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a>security branch of Western Transvaal and specifically </p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a>Zeerust, Capt Marthinus Ras Jnr was working in that area at </p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a>that stage.  They would have made sure by means of source </p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a>reports that the people who were doing business on those </p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a>premises, favoured liberation movements and helped them </p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a>financially, that they received food, they received </p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a>information. I accepted this and I accepted that this place </p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a>was used for that specific purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a>ADV MPSHE:  I don't want to believe that you were told or </p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a>instructed by Eugene de Kock, and others, Willie Nortje, </p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a>that come with us, we are going to do an operation in </p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a>Botswana and you were not told as to the specifics and as to </p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a>what has been investigated and found before you could go </p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a>with them. Is that what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chairman, as I have already testified, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a>were told that the place was an entrance route at places </p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a>where terrorists could overnight, where terrorists were </p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a>helped.  They received information there, information was </p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a>transferred there, and it was an operation.  At Vlakplaas I </p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a>never worked with files. I was a foot soldier. I was in a </p>

<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a>ADV MPSHE	91	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a>war against liberation movements for the Government of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a>day.  I accepted that since these orders came from the head </p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a>office, that they would have made sure that this information </p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a>was correct.  It was not just simply decided we are bored </p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a>and therefore we have to go over the border and destroy the </p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a>house.  It came from the top. I believed that they knew what </p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a>they were doing. I never doubted the orders that came from </p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a>the top.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a>ADV MPSHE:   Let me confine it because whenever I ask a </p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a>question and then you go very wide on my question. I will </p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a>confine you to what I want you to tell me, to tell this </p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a>Committee.  Was the Kahn family eliminated because they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a>activists or terrorists in Botswana or because they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a>housing terrorists in Botswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  They were aiding, helping terrorists. I do not </p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a>know to which party they belonged, but according to me, if </p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a>you helped a terrorist, you do conform yourself to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a>struggle, to the liberation movement.  They were activists </p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a>against the South African Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a>ADV MPSHE:   Yes, that may be so but helping a terrorist or </p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a>an activist doesn't necessarily mean that you are also a </p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>terrorist or an activist.  Is that not the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, Mr Chair, I see it differently. If you </p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a>helped a terrorist movement at that stage you were in my </p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a>books, also part of the struggle and a terrorist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Let me take you back to the Ribeiro matter, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a>think the same facts in the Ribeiro matter would also come </p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a>in here.  Yes, I am told you were not involved in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a>Ribeiro matter, but you were present when the evidence was </p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>given and cross-examination was done on this Ribeiro matter. </p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a> That day, it was established that Dr Ribeiro himself was </p>

<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a>ADV MPSHE	92	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a>an activist but assisted activists and terrorists medically. </p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a> How do you respond to that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a>MR DU PLESSIS OBJECTS:  Mr Chairman, with respect, I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a>want to inhibit my learned friend, but I don't understand </p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a>the relevance of that question. I don't understand why the </p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a>Ribeiro matter is raised here and I don't understand the </p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a>reason for the questioning. I object against the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Mr Chairman, it is very easy to understand. The </p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a>witness has just testified that if you assist an activist or </p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a>a terrorist, it means you associate yourself with that and </p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a>you may be an activist yourself. Now I am sketching out the </p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a>Ribeiro incident in that it was found the opposite in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a>Ribeiro matter, not by this Committee, but the evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a>...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  But Mr Mpshe, then perhaps you should put the </p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a>whole story.  There was also evidence that they assisted </p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a>them financially to go out of the country and assisted them </p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a>financially after their return.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a>ADV MPSHE:  That is correct, that was the evidence given.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a>But the point I am trying to make here, is that the fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a>that he was assisting them financially and medically, did </p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a>not make him an activist. As the witness says if you do </p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a>assist, then you are one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a>JUDGE MALL:   I think Mr Mpshe, on that point you can </p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a>address us on when the time comes, in the Ribeiro case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a>ADV MPSHE:  As it pleases the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Thank you.   Thank you, Mr Chairman, that will </p>

<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  One of the problems I have with the evidence </p>

<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a>JUDGE WILSON	93	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a>here, and in other instances, is you continually say you </p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a>were a foot soldier.  You merely carried out the </p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a>instructions of the generals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  And you took part in the killings of numbers </p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a>of people.  You can't even remember what year this was in.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>This was somewhere between 1989 and 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  That is the impact it had on you.  Why did </p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a>you people never take the trouble to do a little </p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a>reconnaissance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, as I have already testified, Capt </p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a>Marthinus Ras who worked in that area, close to the border, </p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a>together with the other security branches, would have made </p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a>sure beforehand what was going on.  They would have checked </p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a>where we were going through, they would have verified with </p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a>the informants, that this Kahn business cum house was used </p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a>...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  These are lovely excuses. They were not </p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a>checking what was happening that night, Ras was with you, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a>wasn't checking, was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  We were not waiting and sent him over to find </p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a>out what was going on.  All of us went together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Yes, but why did you Vlakplaas hit squad who </p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a>was brought in from Vlakplaas to the Western Cape, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a>Eastern Cape, Eastern Transvaal, all over the country to </p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a>kill, why didn't you check first?  You did not know who was </p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a>sleeping in that house that night.  You made no effort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  The whole of your unit made no effort to find </p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a>out.  There might have been a doctor who was treating </p>

<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a>JUDGE WILSON	94	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a>someone who had been brought in urgently ill, or a nurse or </p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a>a priest.  You didn't know.  You went in and killed the </p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a>people you found in the houses.  Why did you not bother to </p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a>check up to make sure there were not innocent people, and in </p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a>this case you would have found there were two children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, Marthinus Ras would, together with </p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a>the local security branch, have verified this information, </p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a>but we didn't go over first to make sure.  We expected </p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a>terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  He was with you, you were all together that </p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a>afternoon, you all went there together.  Nobody, it is quite </p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a>obvious, nobody was checking up and nobody did in the other </p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a>cases.  Why not?  I am not asking for a motive for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a>attack, I am asking for the actual mechanism.  You are going </p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a>to attack a house.  You are going to shoot the people in it </p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a>and blow it up.  Why did you never take the trouble to find </p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a>out who precisely was in that house, which you could have </p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a>done in most instances, by just watching the house for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a>afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, it was in a different country.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a>Marthinus Ras' amnesty application is already before you. I </p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a>will request the Committee to ask him these questions, </p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a>because he was in control of this operation, together with </p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a>the security branch.  There might also be other applications </p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a>...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  You were the Vlakplaas hit squad brought in </p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a>to do the killings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a>CAPT MENTZ:   That's correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Why did the Vlakplaas hit squad not check up </p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>on what they were attacking?  Why do you always try to put </p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a>the blame on somebody else.</p>

<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a>JUDGE WILSON	95	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  I refer here to Marthinus Ras who was with me </p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a>in the Vlakplaas hit squad, it was his operation.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a>accepted that he would have made sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  I thought he was in the Western Transvaal </p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>Special Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, Mr Chair, he was also at Vlakplaas, but he </p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a>worked in the Western Transvaal/Botswana district, from </p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a>Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  So you agree, you made no effort to check up </p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a>who was in the houses before you attacked them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  The whole of your Vlakplaas unit, not just </p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a>you individually.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chairman, Marthinus Ras would - he was not</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a>all the time with me, he would have made sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  He was with you that afternoon and evening, </p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a>he wasn't checking up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  From the time we came to the farm, yes.  But I </p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a>did not go there with him.  We weren't driving there in - </p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a>together, so I don't know if he checked beforehand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  But he was with you at the farm, he wasn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a>watching the place.  The other cases we heard, you didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a>check on beforehand, did you? It was not your practice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, we acted on a source information from other </p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a>branches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  On page 71, the third paragraph or the last </p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a>paragraph there, that sentence reads "that nobody knew who </p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a>were in the house before the house was entered." what does </p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a>that mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, when I read this sentence I added to </p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a>that, I said nobody knew who was in the house, but I believe </p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE	96	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a>that Marthinus Ras would have known.  We weren't told.  When </p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a>I testified in main I extended on that, expanded on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  On what basis do you believe that Ras would </p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a>he have known?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, because I spoke to Marthinus Ras </p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a>during this week and he told that his application - I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a>know if it is here yet, but he says he explains it in his </p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a>application who knew and who didn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Further on you say,</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a>		"There was no information that there had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a>children in the house, and nobody expected </p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a>children in the house".</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a>what time did the attack take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  It was after one in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Surely you would have expected that children </p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a>would be there in the house at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair now that I think back, yes, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a>didn't know that there were going to be children in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a>house. I knew that Kahn and the terrorists in the house </p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a>would have been eliminated and that the place would then be </p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a>blown up to destroy the buildings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  If the Kahn had children where would you </p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a>expect their children to be at that time of the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  You see this sentence of yours that there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a>no evidence that there were children in the house, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a>puzzling.  The real question should have been, was there </p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a>information that there were no children in the house, isn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a>it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, Mr Chair, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Because one would have expected that time of </p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE	97	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a>the night that children should be in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, Mr Chair, I admit that, that's true, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a>thought there was going to be Mr Kahn and the terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Was there any real concerns about the safety </p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a>of children in the house, was there any serious concern on </p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a>the part of your team?</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, Mr Chair, there was never any talk of </p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a>children being in the house. It was never discussed.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a>don't know if specifically the people who were in the house </p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a>who shot the people there, then discussed it amongst </p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a>themselves, but it was never mentioned before we reached the </p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a>farm house.  I was the back-up, I was never told that.  It </p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a>was never discussed, but I don't know if, whether or not </p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a>they discussed it beforehand, those people who went in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a>house, if they knew this, but I am sure that Marthinus Ras </p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a>will come and explain this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  And what you do know, you say here is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a>there were instructions that the occupants of the house be </p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a>eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  And nothing further was said about the </p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a>children, as far as you can remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, Mr Chair, terrorists were expected in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a>house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Where in Botswana was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, I am not exactly sure, but Col Roelf </p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a>Venter testified, I think they - he spoke about Derdepoort. </p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a> This rings a bell somewhere that it could have been in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a>area, the Derdepoort border post.  I have never been there. </p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a>I am not one hundred per cent sure, but it could have been </p>

<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a>Zeerust you pass through Zeerust, and there somewhere to the </p>

<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  (Indistinct - not translated).</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  He went to pay an informant from Botswana </p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a>there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  When were you transferred to Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  It was the 1st of August 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  That was after you met De Kock when you </p>

<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a>ADV DE JAGER	99	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a>arrested one of his Vlakplaas unit members for murder in </p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a>South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That's correct, it was Almond Nofemela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Perhaps to help the Committee Mr Chairman </p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a>Derdepoort, as the witness has correctly stated, before you </p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a>can reach Zeerust, there is a turn-off at the Groot Marico, </p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a>just over the bridge, you turn right into Groot Marico and </p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a>then it takes you through to the Swartruggens area, </p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a>Derdepoort is just around there. It was the border of </p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a>Botswana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  A very long way from Richards Bay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, Mr Chair, Richards Bay, we went there </p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a>afterwards to create an alibi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  Can you probably throw more light why you </p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a>chose Richards Bay all the way from North West?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, it was to make sure that nobody could </p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a>have seen us in the vicinity or in the area, because then </p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a>they could have concluded that we were in the vicinity and </p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a>there was an attack at the house.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  It is approximately the farthest place you </p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a>can come or you can go in South Africa from Derdepoort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is correct, Mr Chair.  The morning when we </p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a>drove away we were told for the first time that we were </p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a>going to Richards Bay.  That's why I say we never had all </p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a>the details of the operation, but the people in command, </p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a>like De Kock and Basson, they knew.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  When did you realise or were told for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a>first time that children were shot dead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  It was the evening when we went over the river </p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a>and when we got in the vehicle, when the place blew up, it </p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a>was said that children were also shot. I don't know who shot </p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a>ADV DE JAGER	100	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a>them, but we were told they were shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  You heard after they had been shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  The purpose for which this operation was </p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a>executed, was to close the gateway for the terrorists into </p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a>and out of the borders of the Republic of South Africa.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a>would be correct in summarising the purpose in that way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is right.  Also to kill terrorists that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a>might have found there, but there weren't any.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  And this Mr Kahn was aiding and abetting the </p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a>terrorists.  Now when did you become aware that the person </p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a>who was aiding and abetting the terrorists was this certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a>Mr Khan?  Was that before you were on your way to Gaberone, </p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a>whilst things were being prepared, or were you told this </p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a>information as you were travelling and crossing all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a>rivers full of crocodiles into Botswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, Mr Chair, we were told this while we were </p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a>at Vlakplaas.  We were told that there was a house in </p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a>Botswana - for the purposes as I have already explained - </p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a>which had to be blown up and eliminated.  But I didn't have </p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a>any source files from Zeerust or the Western Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  Who told you, was it Marthinus Ras Jnr?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  It might have been either Ras or De Kock, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a>think it would rather have been De Kock.  He was our </p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a>commander and he would have told this to us.  He would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a>told us that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  Did you think it relevant at that stage to ask </p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a>for more details about Mr Kahn to find out more about his </p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a>marital status, to find out more about who the occupants of </p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a>the house were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, Mr Chair, I never received orders from De </p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a>MS KHAMPEPE	101	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a>Kock with regards to covert offensive or defensive </p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a>operations.  Because he had been the commanding officer and </p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a>liaised with us, as well as with security head office, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a>never questioned this. I believed that it would have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a>proved by head office and police and that those people would </p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a>have made sure that the information is correct. I never </p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a>asked questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  You felt no responsibility to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, Mr Chair, my seniors - I believed my </p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a>seniors would have done that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a>JUDGE MALL:  I just want to clear up a point which worries </p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a>me too.  When the decision to attack this house and property </p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a>was made known to you, were you told specifically that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a>were going to be terrorists in that house at the time you </p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a>were going to attack, or was that a matter of no concern?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a>You knew that there was a house, you knew that there was an </p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a>owner and according to you, it was known that that owner </p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a>provided succour to terrorists and so on, and so it didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a>matter whether there were terrorists or not, you were going </p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a>to blow up this house, irrespective of - even though there </p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a>were no terrorists there?  Was that the plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, I was brought under the impression </p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a>that there might have been terrorists there.  But the house </p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a>had to be blown up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a>JUDGE MALL:  There might have been terrorists and even if </p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a>there were no terrorists the house had to be blown up.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a>That's the point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, Mr Chair, the place had to be destroyed so </p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a>that it could not be used again in the future.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes, so even if there were no terrorists, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a>house and the family that occupied this house, had to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a>JUDGE MALL	102	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a>eliminated, had to be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Captain on page 69, you say that - I might </p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a>have missed something here - the purpose of the operation </p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a>had been to eliminate a shop and a large business.  Is this </p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a>what happened eventually?</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, it must read the house.   The people </p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a>weren't sleeping in the shop, the house had to be blown up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  I am told that in your evidence, you added </p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a>"and the house". In other words it would have said that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a>aim of the operation was to eliminate "a house, a shop and a </p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a>large business".</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  What I meant to say was that it was a business </p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a>complex, there was a shop, but the house at the business </p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a>complex, I mean, the house had to be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  But there must be a shop and then a business </p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a>premises in which people would not be sleeping, people would </p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a>be sleeping in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is what I meant.  Let's say it was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a>smallholding with a shop and a house next to it on one </p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a>premises, the house was next to the shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  What troubles me is whether you did stick to </p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a>the mandate?  Were you told to eliminate the shop and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a>business, which is something quite distinct from the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, this is a mistake.  The order was to </p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a>destroy the house.  There was no attempt to burn down the </p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a>house - ag, pardon,  the business.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  It is not just one word that we are dealing </p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a>with here, we are dealing with quite a number of points.  A </p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a>shop and a large business, you in fact even described the </p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a>business, shop and business, described as a big business or </p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE	103	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a>something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, there was only one business on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a>premises. There was only a shop.  There was no garage or </p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a>whatever else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  But you see when you initially compiled your </p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a>application you knew that the people were killed in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a>house, isn't it?  You knew that the people were killed in </p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a>the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Now how could you have by accident have </p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a>omitted also to say that the house was also to be attacked, </p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a>and instead only mentioned the shop and the business?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, but just at the end of this paragraph </p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a>it is mentioned that it was used for a liaising house.  It </p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a>might have been the case, but we never attempted to destroy </p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a>the shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:   I am trying to understand the basis on which </p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a>you could possibly have made this kind of mistake when you </p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a>compiled your application.  How could you have forgotten to </p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a>mention the house, when in fact you knew then already that </p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a>the people were killed in the house.  How could you have </p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a>forgotten also to mention that the house was also to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a>attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, we sat late at night in drawing up </p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a>these affidavits.  We had to take it to the police the next</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a>morning.  It could have slipped in there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:    Well let's see what you mean, are you </p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a>saying that you were also, you were instructed also to </p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a>eliminate the shop and the business?</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, Mr Chair, what I mean here ... </p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a>(intervention).</p>

<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, can I please come in here.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a>You will see on page 71, specifically - specifically in page </p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a>71 there is a clear distinction between the house and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a>shop; explosives were put in the house and the inhabitants </p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a>were shot in the house, nobody knew who was in the house.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a>was inside the premises and I looked into the shop to see if </p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a>there were not people there.  So he draws the distinction </p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a>there later on.  I just want to point that out in all </p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a>fairness Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:   I know that, I know that they attacked the </p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a>house, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairman, but the line of </p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a>questioning, with respect, was that he never mentioned in </p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a>his application the house. I just wanted to clear that up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  No.  No, that is not the line of my </p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a>questioning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, then I misunderstood.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Initially I did so, but my attention was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a>drawn to the fact that he did mention the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, then I misunderstood it.  Thank you Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a>Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Yes.  Now I am going back to page 69.  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a>said that the shop and business were to be eliminated.  Or </p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a>do you want to delete that or that whole portion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  If the Committee would allow me, I just want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a>reiterate, what I meant was this is a business premises, </p>

<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a>other things were sold.  There were no other businesses.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a>The shop and the premises with the shop on it, is business </p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a>premises and next to that was a house.  I expressed myself </p>

<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a>wrongly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Yes, well that will leave us with a shop, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a>that there was a shop, isn't it.  Now I am asking you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a>whether your instructions were to attack that shop or </p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a>whether we should also cancel, delete the shop as well, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a>leave only the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, no, we only had to attack the home or </p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a>the house where the people ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:   And the shop and the business are all a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a>mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  ....  where the terrorists might have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a>been....(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:   They should not have been here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a>CAPT MENTZ:    We weren't ordered to burn down the house, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a>there was no explosives - there was only explosives for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a>house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:   Are you sure that this is a mistake, wasn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a>this actually the order that you go and blow up a shop and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a>instead of blowing the shop you people deviated and then </p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a>attacked the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, Mr Chair, the order was Kahn, the house and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a>terrorists.  The people there had to be eliminated, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a>house had to be blown up. It was never said that while you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a>people are going to attack the house, others had to burn </p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a>down the shop.  That was never said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Well I've noted your point, you are you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a>saying that all this was a mistake and we could just as well </p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a>delete that, but I must tell you that I cannot understand </p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a>how you could have made this kind of mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Can you recall who conveyed to you precisely </p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a>what you were supposed to do, what you were supposed to </p>

<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a>JUDGE MALL	106	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a>destroy?  Who told you precisely, was it De Kock, was it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a>Ras?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, it was De Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Was he conveying his remarks to you personally </p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a>or to the group as a whole?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  At the farmhouse there was a quick meeting and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a>it was told to me, if I remember correctly, you and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a>Andronowitz must stay behind all the time, to make sure that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a>we are not being pursued or attacked from behind.  I was on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a>my way there and I stayed behind all the time and the same </p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a>on our way back, I stayed right at the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.  No, I am concerned about the instructions </p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a>as to what was to be destroyed, when that was being told, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a>was that told to you personally or was that told to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a>group that you are going there to destroy this, that or the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a>other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, it was given to the group that the house </p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a>had to be attacked, terrorists and Kahn had to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a>eliminated, we had to set explosives.  If I remember </p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a>correctly the explosives were set in the main bedroom and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a>then we left the area.  But we were never told you, you and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a>you must shoot the children. That was never said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a>JUDGE MALL:   No, I wasn't thinking about that.  I know what </p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a>you were told that you and Andronowitz were to stay behind </p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a>or follow from the rear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, there was a group meeting beforehand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes I heard they had a group meeting, their </p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a>instructions were that you were going to destroy certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a>things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a>JUDGE MALL:  When you left Vlakplaas you didn't know what </p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a>JUDGE MALL	107	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a>you were going to do. Is that it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, Chairperson.  At Vlakplaas we were told </p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a>that we were going to jump the fence into Botswana and that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a>there was a house which the terrorists were using.  So we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a>knew we were going to operate in Botswana.  That we knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Were you told that after the operation you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a>were going to go and establish an alibi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, as I said, that morning after we finished </p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a>and we came to the farmhouse, we decided we would go to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a>Richards Bay to constitute an alibi. That was told to us </p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a>then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Where did you get the clothing to go and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a>create your alibi in Richards Bay?  Here you were all </p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a>dressed in dark denim clothing, which would have stood out </p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a>like a sore thumb in Richards Bay, wouldn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, Mr Chair,  but as I testified earlier, at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a>Vlakplaas if you left to go and do a job you sometimes were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a>absent for two or three weeks.  So we always carried clothes </p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a>with us, other, a change of clothes. We only put on the dark </p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a>clothes there on the farm.  For the rest we had normal, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a>wore normal clothes, we never wore uniforms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  So all of you had enough clothing to last for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a>some time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  Mr Mentz, you have given evidence that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a>cannot sleep even up to this day because of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a>participation in the killing of the children, which is still </p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a>weighing heavily on your shoulders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Chairperson, I was involved in several things </p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a>which affected me, and at times I have to use sleeping </p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a>tablets to be able to sleep.  These things affected me. I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a>MS KHAMPEPE	108	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a>can't say it was only this case or another case.  Each and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a>every time when you talk about these things it all comes </p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a>back to you and then the whole thing starts afresh.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  How did you feel when you received the payment </p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a>of R6 000,00 from Mr Nortje, knowing that it was payment </p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a>related to the killing of such children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  All of us received that, we all used it and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a>thought well, that's the way it worked and I used it, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a>feel bad and I have remorse about the children.  As I said, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a>at the start of my evidence, the way I tried to deal with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a>this and to make it easier for me, I use the example of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a>Defence Force with cross-border operations and aerial </p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a>attacks and in the course of which innocent children are </p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a>also killed.  That's the way I try to explain it to myself </p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a>or to justify it to myself, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Any re-examination?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a>application.  Could you please read the last paragraph.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  I tried to make this application as detailed as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a>possible.  Any further elaboration on the facts will be done </p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a>during my testifying before the Commission.  Aspects such </p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a>as, for instance, my motives and the objectives with which I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a>pursued these acts will be more fully motivated during </p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a>evidence.  Due to constraints of time I stand by the </p>

<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a>were drafted, you have also talked about this with Marthinus </p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a>Ras. Is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, not one of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Capt Mentz, the evidence which you have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a>given about this incident here today, is that the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Is there any reason why you would lie to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a>this Committee about the blowing up of the house or the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a>blowing up of the shop or business complex? Is there any </p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a>reason why you would want to tell a lie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Not at all, Chairperson, that is why we are </p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a>here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Is there any benefit which you would derive </p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a>from not telling the truth on that aspect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, Chairperson, if I don't tell the truth, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a>simply prejudice myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Are you satisfied that if the written </p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a>portion of your application, if that does not set out the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a>situation hundred per cent correctly, that you have now </p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a>clarified the position before the Committee and that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a>have now heard the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, the questions put to me by the Committee </p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a>have clarified this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Capt Mentz, there are some questions about </p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a>previous applications and also this application.  Questions </p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a>have been asked to yourself and other persons who were in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a>subordinate positions and I would like to go into this in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a>some detail to sketch the situation in the military context. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a> The South African police at that stage, especially in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a>Vlakplaas, which operated like a military unit, I would like </p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a>the Committee to understand the customs and the practices. </p>

<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	110	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a>If a higher officer gives you an instruction during this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a>period that we are now referring to, and I am specifically </p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a>referring to this incident, would you have accepted that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a>instruction was given on the basis of information at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a>disposal of a senior officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  And as I have already said, if De Kock gave </p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a>you an instruction then I believed that it came from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a>general staff security police.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  I never doubted De Kock's instructions. I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a>believed it came from head office.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Is that how the system worked, Capt Mentz?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.  I never opposed De Kock or anything like </p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a>that at that stage.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  For instance, let us sketch the situation, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a>I would like the Committee to understand this.  Could there </p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a>have been a situation where you would meet and where the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a>instructions were given and then the matter was discussed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a>and then you would ask questions, you cross-examine the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a>commanding officer to make sure that his information was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a>correct.  Would that have been a possible scenario?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  I don't know, nobody ever questioned De Kock in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a>my presence.  We accepted that it came from head office. I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a>never cross-questioned him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  And during your training, was that what you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a>were taught, that instructions work in this way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  And during your training as a policeman were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a>you not told to obey the law?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, but these were different circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Yes, but you knew that this was not legal </p>

<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a>actions done by policemen during the course of their duties, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a>didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  Capt Mentz, if, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a>for instance, you were to launch your own enquiry as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a>result of this information or your own investigation, would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a>it firstly have been possible for you in your position to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a>get information from the informers in the Western Transvaal, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a>acting on your own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, because then I would have had to say to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a>them no, you wait, just wait, don't do anything, I am now </p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a>going to get into my car, drive to Western Transvaal and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a>want to get insight into all these things.  It never </p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a>happened and I couldn't do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  What would your commanding officer's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a>reactions have been if you had tried to do something like </p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a>that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That I didn't trust them or the security branch </p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a>or the police.  They would have worked me out.   I would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a>then have constituted a security risk for them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Capt Mentz, at that stage did you know </p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a>about operations abroad done by the South African forces, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a>Defence Force and Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Were you at that stage aware of the fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a>that South African Defence Force operated in South West </p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a>Africa and in Angola?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Did you know about the police unit Koevoet </p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a>in South West Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	112	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Did you know how they operated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Did you accept that that was part of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a>Government's policy, do you think the Government knew about </p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a>this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  And did you accept that the Government </p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a>approved of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, Chairperson, we were never called in and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a>told stop your activities or anything like that, so I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a>believed that that was proved under the policy of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a>National Party to combat terrorism.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  And in that light, in that context, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a>instruction which you received about this incident, did you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a>consider this to be part of that context?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Did you regard it as justified in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a>circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Did you regard it as an instruction from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a>head office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, as I have said earlier, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  And Capt Mentz, your own subjective view </p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a>about this matter, what were your views about the people in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a>commanding positions at head office, who would have given </p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a>these instructions and their knowledge of the operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  I believed that the instructions came from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a>them, they approved them and that was why it was carried </p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a>out, and that it was done with the approval of the National </p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a>Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Do you never whether there was a report </p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	113	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a>sent back on this incident, back to head office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Did anybody in your group involved in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a>operation, were they ever repudiated at any stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, not one of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  And that was the case, despite the fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a>that children had been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That's correct, and that's why they sent us </p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a>money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Now about the issue of the children, I want </p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a>to ask you one or two questions.  Did you know, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a>yourself, did you know beforehand that the Kahn family had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a>children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Do you know whether any of the other people </p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a>involved in the operation knew that the Kahn family had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a>children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  At that stage I didn't know, but now I do know. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a> As a result of my conversation with Marthinus Ras, I now </p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a>know that he knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  That he knew that there were children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, and that is what he will testify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Where you were present, were there any </p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a>discussions about children ever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, except when we crossed the river back into </p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a>the Republic when the house was blown up, it was said that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a>there were children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Captain, you were also asked about the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a>possibility of reconnaissance operations beforehand to check </p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a>out the scene there. Now in the circumstances reigning on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a>that evening and the way in which the operation was carried </p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	114	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a>out, and the area, would it have been possible, could it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a>have been done easily?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, as I testified earlier, we were not to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a>seen in that area.  That's why we created the alibi, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a>Richards Bay alibi.  If we had tried to go there earlier </p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a>that day and drive around there and we had been seen, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a>would have blown the whole operation.  That's why we stayed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a>on the farm, we were not allowed to leave there.  We only </p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a>left there that night to go to that place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  If one person, presumably a black person had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a>wandered around outside the shop, can you seriously say that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a>would have blown the whole operation? I am not talking about </p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a>the whole mob of you driving in your cars, waving your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a>silenced guns.  It was perfectly easy for you, from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a>Vlakplaas, we have heard of all the askaris you have, to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a>taken one and sent him quietly to just see who went in and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a>out of the house.  Wouldn't it have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is so, Chairperson, but perhaps it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a>done and perhaps I was not aware of it by the local security </p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a>branch sources. I don't know about that though.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  So if it was done, they went in knowing there </p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a>were children in that house and determined to kill them. Is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a>that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chairperson, I don't know whether it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a>done, I can only testify about what I know, I can't testify </p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a>on anybody's else's behalf.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  If it was done, it means they went in knowing </p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a>it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  It is possible, but I didn't know it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  What did you expect there, whom did you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a>expect to find there?  Could you answer?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	115	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Kahn and terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  And Mrs Kahn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Possibly, yes, I foresaw the possibility that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a>she could be there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  You talk about the Kahn family.  When you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a>talk about a family you would normally think of children as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a>well, don't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is so.  I didn't know that there were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a>children.  But, I have already said, that if at Vlakplaas I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a>was told that there could possibly be children involved, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a>then I would have had a problem with it, but I would still </p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a>have gone along with the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Do you know how old the children could have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a>been or are you not at all aware?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, until today I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  No further questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV DU PLESSIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  You said a moment ago that no one in your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a>group was ever repudiated, but you took steps, we have heard </p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a>from time to time, to avoid or to frustrate police </p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a>investigation into some of the killings, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Very well, thank you. We move onto some other </p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a>aspect of the matter now, Mr Du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairman, the next matter we wish </p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a>to deal with is page 104, the happening at Penge Mine.  Capt </p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a>Mentz, please start on page 105, read that for us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Chairperson, I would just like to say that, if </p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a>I remember correctly, this happened before the Brian </p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a>Ngqulunga case, but I can't remember specific dates.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a>Ngqulunga was July 1990, I think.  If I remember correctly, </p>

<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a>this happened before that, and in my application I didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a>know who the victim was in this case.  The Attorney </p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a>General's office, during our first session in Johannesburg, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a>they asked and told me it was Johannes Maboti.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Mr Du Plessis, I think this mine spelling is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a>P-E-N-G-E, Penge Mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a>JUDGE MALL:   Proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Col Eugene de Kock, I cannot remember the date, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a>but it was after two in the afternoon, Eugene de Kock, Col </p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a>Eugene de Kock gave the instructions to take him to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a>Vereeniging in his vehicle, it was a Toyota Cressida.  At </p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a>that stage I didn't know exactly what it was all about.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a>went to a police station near Vereeniging.  As far as I can </p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a>remember, it was the De Deur police station.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a>	When we arrived there we met Warrant Officer Duiwel </p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a>Brits.  He was there in a brown Land Cruiser.  Sgt Louw van </p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a>Niekerk, Sgt Leon Floris.  We were outside the police </p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a>station and then another security branch policeman - I know </p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a>he is a security branch in Vereeniging, but I don't know </p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a>him.  He came walking out of the police station with a Black </p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a>askari.  It was the first time that I had seen that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a>particular askari. 	Col De Kock told him to come with and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a>the security policeman from Vereeniging was then no longer </p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a>with us.  The askari got into the vehicle by himself, into </p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a>Brits' vehicle, he was not forced to get into the vehicle.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a>	Col De Kock and I followed the Land Cruiser.  I asked </p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a>De Kock where we were going and he said we were going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a>Penge Mine to find out what the askari had to say. We then </p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a>went from Vereeniging on the freeway as far as Pretoria and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a>then on the Witbank freeway.  On the other side of Boschkop </p>

<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	117	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a>we took a turn-off to the left and then it becomes a gravel </p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a>road. Here I want to make a correction.  Where it says the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a>askari was tied up, that's wrong.  I will point that out </p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a>now.	When we stopped on the dirt road and I got out of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a>car and I went to the vehicle I then saw that the askari was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a>tied up. I then inferred that they had tied him up whilst we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a>were driving.  I mean his hands were cuffed or something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a>	At that stage I wasn't quite certain of the purpose of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a>this operation, what was to happen to him, but my conclusion </p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a>was that the askari had been detained at the police station </p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a>in De Deur and I believed that he would probably be killed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a>because he was an ANC or PAC freedom fighter who had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a>caught by the security police.  He then became an askari and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a>that he had gone back to the ANC and given information to</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a>them. I then suspected that he probably would be killed, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a>because otherwise we would have gone back to Vlakplaas with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a>him, and De Kock would then have spoken to him there.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a>	I can't remember exactly why we stopped at Boschkop.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a>As far as I can remember now, I think De Kock wanted to make </p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a>sure that he was tied up.  I say here, and he also </p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a>handcuffed him.  I don't think he physically cuffed him, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a>think he just checked to see that the cuffs were secure.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a>	We then drove off to Penge Mine, the mine situated on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a>the other side of Burgersfort, in the Eastern Transvaal and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a>it was the first time that I ever went there.  We arrived at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a>the mine. It was - there was a small village community and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a>then outside the place there were several mines and this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a>Penge Mine was one of these mines.  We arrived there that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a>night at the mine and then met Warrant Officer Snor </p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a>Vermeulen and Warrant Officer Lionel Snyman.  They are also </p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a>witnesses for the Attorney General.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	118	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a>	Penge Mine was at that stage used for a training base </p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a>and askaris were there trained by Vermeulen and Snyman. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Could you - Penge Mine is also about 300 </p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a>kilometres from Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  In the north-easterly direction of the old </p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a>Province of the Transvaal. It is now the Northern Province,</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That's correct.	The askari was then cuffed to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a>a pole and we drank further there.  Later that night De Kock </p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a>gave an instruction that we should take the man with us to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a>the mine dumps.  It is not on top of a mine dump, I would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a>say it was sort of a hole that had been dug, excavated area. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a> When we got there a chair had already been placed there and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a>an explosive had already been attached to the underside of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a>the chair. The askari was then placed on the chair and tied </p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a>to the chair. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a>	On the way there I walked right at the back. Whilst I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a>was walking at the back I saw how Floris, that is Leon </p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a>Floris, gave De Kock a revolver.   I say here in my </p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a>application it could have been a pistol, but afterwards I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a>thought about it again and I am almost certain that it was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a>revolver, the .38 type.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a>	As I said the explosives had already been tied to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a>underside of a chair before we arrived there.  De Kock </p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a>meanwhile had now received the weapon from Floris and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a>shot him twice or three times.  When I saw that he was about </p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a>to shoot him I looked away, but he shot him three times. I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a>therefore didn't see how the bullets hit the man directly.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a>	Nobody told me, yes, he had gone over to the other </p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a>side, but that is what my belief was, that the man had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a>returned to the ANC and had given them information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	119	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a>	We then walked back and whilst we were doing so Lionel </p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a>Snyman had an LMG machine-gun and it was mounted some </p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a>distance away and he then shot off a couple of shots in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a>mine dumps, to make it sound as if we were busy with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a>training at night, et cetera.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a>	I then continue.  Whilst we were walking back I became </p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a>very nauseous. If I say nauseous, I don't mean that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a>stopped and vomited.  My nerves were very, very tense, I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a>very nervous and I had a nervous feeling at the pit of my </p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a>stomach.  I say here that it was totally unacceptable for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a>me.  I knew the man was to be killed and I associated myself </p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a>with that, but the way in which it was done, I found </p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a>unacceptable. If they wanted to kill him they should have</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a>shot him from behind or they should have blindfolded him or </p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a>something, but don't shoot him where he is tied to a chair </p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a>and actually looks at you. I didn't feel good about that.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a>When we were nearly at the base camp, the explosion took </p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a>place and the askari was blow into the air.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a>	 I was never told what the real reason was but my </p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a>inference was, and I stand by that, that that is the reason </p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a>why he was killed.  My inference was that he was an askari </p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a>who had returned to the ANC and then gave them information </p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a>that he was arrested and that there probably hadn't been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a>enough evidence against him.  If I say information which he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a>could possibly have given was that he could have given </p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a>information about SAP members and he could have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a>subjected to intimidation, especially the black members, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a>their homes were attacked, petrol-bombs were thrown at their </p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a>houses.  In some cases some of them were killed.  And the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a>information which he could have passed on, for instance, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a>could have revealed the identity of any </p>

<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Mr Mentz, you don't know of anything, you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a>now speculating.  Do you know what the reason was or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Nobody told me, but that is the inference that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a>I drew, that he was passing on information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  But the nature of the information and exactly </p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a>what it was about, that is something that you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a>speculating on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  I don't know.  I continue.  The middle of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a>last paragraph.  It must, however, be remembered that I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a>a non-commissioned officer and my senior officer did never </p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a>completely confide in me about everything, and in this case </p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a>De Kock did not take me into his confidence by telling me </p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a>exactly why the Askari was eliminated, as I have already </p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a>said, that is an inference which I drew. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a>	I, in my earlier evidence also said how I regarded </p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a>instructions from De Kock, that he was in liaison with head </p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a>office and that the generals would have approved it.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a>regarded it as part of the struggle against the ANC at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a>stage, and regarded it as the elimination of an ANC activist </p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a>and terrorist who had returned to the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  You keep calling people terrorists, when you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a>have no basis for doing it whatsoever.  You don't know what </p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a>this person had done, you don't know why he was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  I will correct that, Chairperson. I will call </p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a>them - I will call him the particular askari, or the askari </p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a>involved. </p>

<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a>this particular person could have been something other than </p>

<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a>one word, askari.    You said what other possibilities, what </p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a>other reasons could have existed for the elimination of an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a>askari.  Once you use the word askari, you have made a lot </p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a>of assumptions.  You have assumed that this person, as we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1595"><a name="pos1595"></a>have come to understand what the word askari means, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1596"><a name="pos1596"></a>already assume that this person must have at some stage have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a>been a so-called terrorist, in the ranks of the ANC.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a>came back, kept at Vlakplaas,  Vlakplaas, all these things </p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a>you are assuming at once, once you use the word askari.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a>think what Mr Mentz should tell us is why do you think this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a>man was an askari, on what basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chairperson, could I put it this way, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a>askaris were not only at Vlakplaas.  In some cases some of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a>them were placed out to other security branches such as in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1605"><a name="pos1605"></a>Natal, Durban.  There were people there who worked with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1606"><a name="pos1606"></a>askaris, in the Cape as well, and in other cities as well.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a>They also had their own askaris who came from Vlakplaas. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1610"><a name="pos1610"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Couldn't this man have been arrested for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1611"><a name="pos1611"></a>stocktheft?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Couldn't this man just have been captured?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1614"><a name="pos1614"></a>Maybe he was, as you say, he was a terrorist, he had just </p>
<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a>been captured, he was not as yet an askari, he was not as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1616"><a name="pos1616"></a>yet converted into an askari.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1617"><a name="pos1617"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, right at the outset of my application I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a>said that De Kock had told me that he wanted to find out </p>
<p class="line" id="line1619"><a name="pos1619"></a>what the askari could tell him, what he wanted to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Oh I see you got it from him, from de Kock. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a>Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1622"><a name="pos1622"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Thank you Mr Chairman. ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1623"><a name="pos1623"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  Mr Mentz, you do make reference that way on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1624"><a name="pos1624"></a>page 105, and that is the last paragraph of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1625"><a name="pos1625"></a>application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1626"><a name="pos1626"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1627"><a name="pos1627"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Capt Mentz, perhaps we should just follow </p>
<p class="line" id="line1628"><a name="pos1628"></a>through the questions they have asked you to their logical </p>
<p class="line" id="line1629"><a name="pos1629"></a>conclusion, in the light of what Judge Mgoepe has just said. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1630"><a name="pos1630"></a> Bearing in mind the way in which Vlakplaas operated as I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1631"><a name="pos1631"></a>have asked you just now, operated against enemies of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1632"><a name="pos1632"></a>State, terrorists, members of liberation movements, this was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1633"><a name="pos1633"></a>an askari.  So is it possible that this was an action by </p>
<p class="line" id="line1634"><a name="pos1634"></a>Vlakplaas members against one of their own people, without </p>
<p class="line" id="line1635"><a name="pos1635"></a>him being in any way involved in liberation movements or </p>
<p class="line" id="line1636"><a name="pos1636"></a>being a supporter or a sympathiser of the liberation </p>
<p class="line" id="line1637"><a name="pos1637"></a>movements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1638"><a name="pos1638"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, no, they wouldn't have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1639"><a name="pos1639"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  According to your view?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1640"><a name="pos1640"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1641"><a name="pos1641"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	124	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1642"><a name="pos1642"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1643"><a name="pos1643"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Could we then turn to the political </p>
<p class="line" id="line1644"><a name="pos1644"></a>motivation. You confirm that in general, from page 110 to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1645"><a name="pos1645"></a>page 115.  And then on page 115 the third paragraph, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1646"><a name="pos1646"></a>second line after the word "duties", is that sentence </p>
<p class="line" id="line1647"><a name="pos1647"></a>correct?  "Although I was not a member of the security </p>
<p class="line" id="line1648"><a name="pos1648"></a>branch"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1649"><a name="pos1649"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, that should be scrapped. From the third </p>
<p class="line" id="line1650"><a name="pos1650"></a>paragraph, "although I was not a member of the security </p>
<p class="line" id="line1651"><a name="pos1651"></a>branch".  That is a mistake on our side.  This came out when </p>
<p class="line" id="line1652"><a name="pos1652"></a>I was stationed at Murder and Robbery.  Then I was not a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1653"><a name="pos1653"></a>member of the security branch, so this is incorrect in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1654"><a name="pos1654"></a>application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1655"><a name="pos1655"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Capt Mentz, do you confirm the rest of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1656"><a name="pos1656"></a>political motivation?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1659"><a name="pos1659"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   115 Mr Chairman, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1660"><a name="pos1660"></a>JUDGE MALL:  What sentence is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1661"><a name="pos1661"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  The sentence in the third paragraph, after </p>
<p class="line" id="line1662"><a name="pos1662"></a>the comma in the second line, is the word "pligte" (duties) </p>
<p class="line" id="line1663"><a name="pos1663"></a>and it must come out from the word "alhoewel" (although) </p>
<p class="line" id="line1664"><a name="pos1664"></a>until the end of that sentence - "although I was not a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1665"><a name="pos1665"></a>member of the security branch".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1666"><a name="pos1666"></a>JUDGE MALL:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1667"><a name="pos1667"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:    That was just included by mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1668"><a name="pos1668"></a>	Capt Mentz, do you confirm page 115 to 116?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1669"><a name="pos1669"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That's correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1676"><a name="pos1676"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MPSHE:  Yes, thank you, Mr Chairman. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1677"><a name="pos1677"></a> Captain, page 115, the second paragraph, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1678"><a name="pos1678"></a>		"The political objective was to combat terrorism </p>
<p class="line" id="line1679"><a name="pos1679"></a>to combat the destabilisation of the country and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1680"><a name="pos1680"></a>also to try and combat the enemies of the State, </p>

<p class="line" id="line1683"><a name="pos1683"></a>how applicable is this to the askari who was eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1684"><a name="pos1684"></a>JUDGE MALL:  What is the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1685"><a name="pos1685"></a>ADV MPSHE:  How applicable is this paragraph to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1686"><a name="pos1686"></a>eliminated askari? In other words, does he fall within the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1687"><a name="pos1687"></a>categories mentioned here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1688"><a name="pos1688"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, if he had passed on information, as I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1689"><a name="pos1689"></a>believed he had, he had been an askari in the police, that's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1690"><a name="pos1690"></a>what I believed he passed on information back to the ANC and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1691"><a name="pos1691"></a>that would have, it would have helped the ANC/PAC in their </p>
<p class="line" id="line1692"><a name="pos1692"></a>struggle to topple the government.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1693"><a name="pos1693"></a>ADV MPSHE:  But that's just an assumption you are making.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1694"><a name="pos1694"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That's what I believed at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1695"><a name="pos1695"></a>ADV MPSHE:   With reference to this man, that is an</p>
<p class="line" id="line1696"><a name="pos1696"></a>assumption you are making now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1697"><a name="pos1697"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, this askari.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1698"><a name="pos1698"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Now if we use the word askari and we accept as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1699"><a name="pos1699"></a>you say that he was an askari, that would tell us that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1700"><a name="pos1700"></a>was on your side, on the National party's side, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1701"><a name="pos1701"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  At first, the way I saw it, an askari, was that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1702"><a name="pos1702"></a>he was first a freedom fighter, and he had then been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1703"><a name="pos1703"></a>arrested by the security police and they had then turned him </p>
<p class="line" id="line1704"><a name="pos1704"></a>or got him so far as to assist us, became an askari with us, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1705"><a name="pos1705"></a>received a police salary and notwithstanding that, whilst he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1706"><a name="pos1706"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1707"><a name="pos1707"></a>ADV MPSHE	126	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1708"><a name="pos1708"></a>was doing his duties, he then fed information, which he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1709"><a name="pos1709"></a>obtained, back to the ANC or PAC, whatever the case may be. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1710"><a name="pos1710"></a> That is as far as I see an askari.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1711"><a name="pos1711"></a>ADV MPSHE:    Yes, let's be specific.  Is my understanding </p>
<p class="line" id="line1712"><a name="pos1712"></a>correct, that if you label, if you say this person is an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1713"><a name="pos1713"></a>askari, that means that he is now working for the security </p>
<p class="line" id="line1714"><a name="pos1714"></a>forces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1715"><a name="pos1715"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.  Yes, in other words he was a double </p>
<p class="line" id="line1716"><a name="pos1716"></a>agent. He made as if he was working for the security forces </p>
<p class="line" id="line1717"><a name="pos1717"></a>...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1718"><a name="pos1718"></a>ADV MPSHE:  That may be so Colonel I just want to know </p>
<p class="line" id="line1719"><a name="pos1719"></a>whether this is the position about an askari, that's all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1720"><a name="pos1720"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That's how I saw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1721"><a name="pos1721"></a>ADV MPSHE:  If he was an askari and as you have agreed with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1722"><a name="pos1722"></a>me, he was working for the security forces, what political </p>
<p class="line" id="line1723"><a name="pos1723"></a>motivation did exist for him to be eliminated if he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1724"><a name="pos1724"></a>working for the security forces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1725"><a name="pos1725"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  But I told you - pardon.  I said that this man </p>
<p class="line" id="line1726"><a name="pos1726"></a>was apparently working for the security police, but then </p>
<p class="line" id="line1727"><a name="pos1727"></a>that would have been a front. He pretended to work for us </p>
<p class="line" id="line1728"><a name="pos1728"></a>whilst at the same time leaking sensitive information back </p>
<p class="line" id="line1729"><a name="pos1729"></a>to the ANC/PAC.  That's what I believed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1730"><a name="pos1730"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Isn't is so that in fact the askaris who </p>
<p class="line" id="line1731"><a name="pos1731"></a>would normally be killed, would be those who were regarded </p>
<p class="line" id="line1732"><a name="pos1732"></a>as being a risk to the security forces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1733"><a name="pos1733"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1734"><a name="pos1734"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Those who were not regarded as a risk, those </p>
<p class="line" id="line1735"><a name="pos1735"></a>who were in the eyes of the security branch were reliable </p>
<p class="line" id="line1736"><a name="pos1736"></a>wouldn't be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1737"><a name="pos1737"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1738"><a name="pos1738"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:    It's only those who would be regarded as </p>

<p class="line" id="line1742"><a name="pos1742"></a>be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1743"><a name="pos1743"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1744"><a name="pos1744"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  And you are saying that in your view, rightly </p>
<p class="line" id="line1745"><a name="pos1745"></a>or wrongly, the deceased in this case fell into that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1746"><a name="pos1746"></a>category for those who were a risk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1747"><a name="pos1747"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  According to the way I saw it, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1748"><a name="pos1748"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Is it not correct that they would also be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1749"><a name="pos1749"></a>killed if they were a danger to the unit in that if they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1750"><a name="pos1750"></a>were going to expose the unit?  In the operations of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1751"><a name="pos1751"></a>unit they would be killed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1759"><a name="pos1759"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No.  So I don't know what happened or what was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1760"><a name="pos1760"></a>said in that vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1761"><a name="pos1761"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  And you say that when you arrived there the </p>

<p class="line" id="line1785"><a name="pos1785"></a>and I stopped somewhere beforehand and we bought beer or </p>
<p class="line" id="line1786"><a name="pos1786"></a>something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1787"><a name="pos1787"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1788"><a name="pos1788"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  I can't remember specifically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1789"><a name="pos1789"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  And who provided the drink now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1790"><a name="pos1790"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  We had bought this liquor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1791"><a name="pos1791"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  You bought some beer which you drank and then </p>
<p class="line" id="line1792"><a name="pos1792"></a>you bought some more you brought along for a party.  Is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1793"><a name="pos1793"></a>the position when you were going to kill the man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1794"><a name="pos1794"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, we bought a lot of alcohol, of drink.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1795"><a name="pos1795"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   And of what sort?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1796"><a name="pos1796"></a>CAPT MENTZ:   I can't remember, I think it was beer, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1797"><a name="pos1797"></a>can't remember. It might have been, there might have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1798"><a name="pos1798"></a>strong drink as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1799"><a name="pos1799"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  And you all drank there before you killed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1800"><a name="pos1800"></a>this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1801"><a name="pos1801"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1802"><a name="pos1802"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Was this man questioned at all in your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1803"><a name="pos1803"></a>presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1804"><a name="pos1804"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Chairperson, no, not where I was present, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line1805"><a name="pos1805"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1806"><a name="pos1806"></a>JUDGE MALL	129	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1807"><a name="pos1807"></a>I can remember when we were drinking there, it was a whole </p>
<p class="line" id="line1808"><a name="pos1808"></a>crowd of us. I think that De Kock and one or two others </p>
<p class="line" id="line1809"><a name="pos1809"></a>spoke to the man.  He was tied up quite a distance away from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1810"><a name="pos1810"></a>us.  If I can sketch the scene, if you enter the mine then </p>
<p class="line" id="line1811"><a name="pos1811"></a>there is a building and lean-to's on the left-hand side and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1812"><a name="pos1812"></a>I - that was Snyman and Vermeulen's base where they slept.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1813"><a name="pos1813"></a>Because they arrived there a couple of days before us.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line1814"><a name="pos1814"></a>sat under the lean-to there and we made a fire and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1815"><a name="pos1815"></a>askari was tied up quite some distance away from us, tied up </p>
<p class="line" id="line1816"><a name="pos1816"></a>to this pole.  And not within earshot, and I think De Kock </p>
<p class="line" id="line1817"><a name="pos1817"></a>and one or two of the others spoke to the man at some stage, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1818"><a name="pos1818"></a>but I was not present during any conversation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1819"><a name="pos1819"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Did you have a braai there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1820"><a name="pos1820"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1821"><a name="pos1821"></a>JUDGE MALL:  The man was not questioned in your presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1822"><a name="pos1822"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1823"><a name="pos1823"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  The second point I want to ask you about, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1824"><a name="pos1824"></a>you told us in your evidence that you found this incident </p>
<p class="line" id="line1825"><a name="pos1825"></a>"totally unacceptable".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1826"><a name="pos1826"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1827"><a name="pos1827"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Did you ask for a transfer from Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1828"><a name="pos1828"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  At a later stage I ... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1829"><a name="pos1829"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  After this incident that you found totally </p>
<p class="line" id="line1830"><a name="pos1830"></a>unacceptable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1831"><a name="pos1831"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Not directly afterwards, but at a later stage I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1832"><a name="pos1832"></a>was transferred to another unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1833"><a name="pos1833"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Yes but why didn't you, if it was totally </p>
<p class="line" id="line1834"><a name="pos1834"></a>unacceptable, this sort of behaviour, why didn't you ask for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1835"><a name="pos1835"></a>a transfer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1836"><a name="pos1836"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Chairperson, I was part of an elite unit.  It </p>
<p class="line" id="line1837"><a name="pos1837"></a>was at that stage seen as an elite unit in the security </p>
<p class="line" id="line1838"><a name="pos1838"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1839"><a name="pos1839"></a>JUDGE WILSON	130	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1840"><a name="pos1840"></a>police. I associated myself with the fact that the man was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1841"><a name="pos1841"></a>being killed or was killed, but as I testified already, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1842"><a name="pos1842"></a>could have done it differently.  They could have, for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1843"><a name="pos1843"></a>instance, blindfolded the man or shot him from behind, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1844"><a name="pos1844"></a>it worried me that he was actually looking straight at them </p>
<p class="line" id="line1845"><a name="pos1845"></a>when they killed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1846"><a name="pos1846"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Was it more important to you be part of this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1847"><a name="pos1847"></a>so-called elite unit than to do what you regarded as morally </p>
<p class="line" id="line1848"><a name="pos1848"></a>right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1849"><a name="pos1849"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Chairperson, I believed that somebody had to do </p>
<p class="line" id="line1850"><a name="pos1850"></a>this dirty work to prop-up the Government of the day and to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1851"><a name="pos1851"></a>combat ANC and PAC terrorists.  Somebody had to do it. If </p>
<p class="line" id="line1852"><a name="pos1852"></a>everybody had asked for transfers who was to do this work, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1853"><a name="pos1853"></a>and that's why I thought I would stay there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1854"><a name="pos1854"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  So although it was totally unacceptable to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1855"><a name="pos1855"></a>you, you would have us believe that, you nevertheless </p>
<p class="line" id="line1856"><a name="pos1856"></a>thought you would stay there to do this sort of work.  Is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1857"><a name="pos1857"></a>that what you are telling us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1858"><a name="pos1858"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1859"><a name="pos1859"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  But would it have been safe for you to ask </p>
<p class="line" id="line1860"><a name="pos1860"></a>for a transfer immediately after this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1861"><a name="pos1861"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, Sir, I have testified about that as well, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1862"><a name="pos1862"></a>because then the chances were that I could just one night be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1863"><a name="pos1863"></a>shot through a window in my home.  The issue here was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1864"><a name="pos1864"></a>the colour of your skin, but if you were a threat for such a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1865"><a name="pos1865"></a>unit in the security police, the chances were that you could </p>
<p class="line" id="line1866"><a name="pos1866"></a>also be eliminated, anybody could be eliminated.  I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1867"><a name="pos1867"></a>scared, I was afraid of De Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1868"><a name="pos1868"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  Mr Mentz,  I know you have already testified </p>
<p class="line" id="line1869"><a name="pos1869"></a>that it was very difficult to question orders of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1870"><a name="pos1870"></a>superiors. In this case you had taken quite a major leap by </p>
<p class="line" id="line1871"><a name="pos1871"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1872"><a name="pos1872"></a>MS KHAMPEPE	131	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1873"><a name="pos1873"></a>asking De Kock where you were going to on arrival at De Deur </p>
<p class="line" id="line1874"><a name="pos1874"></a>police station, and after seeing there the askari getting </p>
<p class="line" id="line1875"><a name="pos1875"></a>into Mr Brits' car, did you not ask for more details about </p>
<p class="line" id="line1876"><a name="pos1876"></a>what the askari was going to be questioned about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1877"><a name="pos1877"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  I did ask De Kock where we were going, because </p>
<p class="line" id="line1878"><a name="pos1878"></a>I was driving the car and I had to know where to drive to. I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1879"><a name="pos1879"></a>can't specifically remember what De Kock and I discussed, it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1880"><a name="pos1880"></a>is a long time ago, but that's why I say I believe that this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1881"><a name="pos1881"></a>askari was a double agent.  I can't say specifically what I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1882"><a name="pos1882"></a>asked him and what he said, because I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1883"><a name="pos1883"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  But was the askari already tied at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1884"><a name="pos1884"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1885"><a name="pos1885"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  So it was not yet apparent that he was going </p>
<p class="line" id="line1886"><a name="pos1886"></a>to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1887"><a name="pos1887"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, I only saw that as Boschkop.  That is where </p>
<p class="line" id="line1888"><a name="pos1888"></a>I made the conclusion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1889"><a name="pos1889"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Mr Mentz, you earlier testified that you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1890"><a name="pos1890"></a>not one of De Kock's confidantes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1891"><a name="pos1891"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, during the first time I testified I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1892"><a name="pos1892"></a>explained that I had initially been taking De Kock around.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1893"><a name="pos1893"></a>No not today, but earlier on.  Later on I worked away from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1894"><a name="pos1894"></a>him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1895"><a name="pos1895"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  I do not think it is very clear whether or </p>
<p class="line" id="line1896"><a name="pos1896"></a>not you are expressing yourself correctly or whether it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1897"><a name="pos1897"></a>the interpretation, I just want to put something to you, as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1898"><a name="pos1898"></a>I understand your evidence.  You associated yourself with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1899"><a name="pos1899"></a>the fact that people had to be killed during the struggle in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1900"><a name="pos1900"></a>which you were involved between the liberation movements and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1901"><a name="pos1901"></a>the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1902"><a name="pos1902"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1903"><a name="pos1903"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  You, however, did not associate yourself with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1904"><a name="pos1904"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1905"><a name="pos1905"></a>ADV DE JAGER	132	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1906"><a name="pos1906"></a>the method used to kill this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1907"><a name="pos1907"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1908"><a name="pos1908"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  What aspect of the method was unacceptable to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1909"><a name="pos1909"></a>you? </p>
<p class="line" id="line1910"><a name="pos1910"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, this askari had to know that he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1911"><a name="pos1911"></a>going to be killed.  Now he is walking with us, in front of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1912"><a name="pos1912"></a>us, he is cuffed, he sees this chair.  He was a trained </p>
<p class="line" id="line1913"><a name="pos1913"></a>terrorist, he knows what explosives look like.  He was tied </p>
<p class="line" id="line1914"><a name="pos1914"></a>to the chair and they shoot him. I cannot remember </p>
<p class="line" id="line1915"><a name="pos1915"></a>specifically his face or where they shot him.  If they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1916"><a name="pos1916"></a>wanted to execute him, I would say shoot him from the back </p>
<p class="line" id="line1917"><a name="pos1917"></a>or blindfold him so that he couldn't see it.  I never - I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1918"><a name="pos1918"></a>felt that this wasn't right.  It bothered me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1919"><a name="pos1919"></a>JUDGE MALL:  So is the position that up to now we will never </p>
<p class="line" id="line1920"><a name="pos1920"></a>know why this man was killed, is that it?  What the precise </p>
<p class="line" id="line1921"><a name="pos1921"></a>reason was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1922"><a name="pos1922"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, except for what I believe, we won't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1923"><a name="pos1923"></a>be able to ascertain that, that it was my impression.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1924"><a name="pos1924"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes no apart from impressions, you never learnt </p>
<p class="line" id="line1925"><a name="pos1925"></a>from De Kock or your superiors precisely why he was killed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1926"><a name="pos1926"></a>and nor did you ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1927"><a name="pos1927"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, it might be that they told me, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1928"><a name="pos1928"></a>can't remember specifically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1929"><a name="pos1929"></a>JUDGE MALL:  So we are left in the dark as far as this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1930"><a name="pos1930"></a>Committee is concerned,  we won't know why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1931"><a name="pos1931"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Except, Mr Chair, for the fact that all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1932"><a name="pos1932"></a>persons I have mentioned have applied to this Committee and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1933"><a name="pos1933"></a>they will testify about that.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1934"><a name="pos1934"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Do you know whether De Kock was accused of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1935"><a name="pos1935"></a>this murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1936"><a name="pos1936"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  I don't know.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1943"><a name="pos1943"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Mr Du Plessis, re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1944"><a name="pos1944"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  I have no re-examination, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1945"><a name="pos1945"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR DU PLESSIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1946"><a name="pos1946"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes, we move onto the next matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1947"><a name="pos1947"></a>EXAMINATION BY ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, the next matter </p>
<p class="line" id="line1948"><a name="pos1948"></a>you will find on page 128.  Capt Mentz, this incident took </p>
<p class="line" id="line1949"><a name="pos1949"></a>place in April 1989 - in 1992, pardon.  Page 129, before you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1950"><a name="pos1950"></a>start with your evidence, Capt Mentz.  What was the position </p>
<p class="line" id="line1951"><a name="pos1951"></a>regarding the bringing in of weapons into the Republic after </p>
<p class="line" id="line1952"><a name="pos1952"></a>negotiations have started with the ANC and the PAC, let's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1953"><a name="pos1953"></a>say from 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1954"><a name="pos1954"></a>CAPT MENTZ:   There was an increased number of smugglings </p>
<p class="line" id="line1955"><a name="pos1955"></a>from neighbouring states.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1956"><a name="pos1956"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   What was the purpose of this smuggling of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1957"><a name="pos1957"></a>weapons, in general?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1958"><a name="pos1958"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  The weapons were smuggled after the banning of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1959"><a name="pos1959"></a>the liberation movements have been lifted.  The weapons we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1960"><a name="pos1960"></a>concentrated on were weapons that were brought in for in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1961"><a name="pos1961"></a>case the negotiations between the ANC, PAC and the National </p>
<p class="line" id="line1962"><a name="pos1962"></a>Party would have been abandoned, so that the weapons could </p>
<p class="line" id="line1963"><a name="pos1963"></a>possibly have been used if the liberation movements wanted </p>
<p class="line" id="line1964"><a name="pos1964"></a>to return to the liberation struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1965"><a name="pos1965"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Can you continue on page 129, can you just </p>
<p class="line" id="line1966"><a name="pos1966"></a>please read to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1967"><a name="pos1967"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  From 1991 at Vlakplaas, weapon smuggling was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1968"><a name="pos1968"></a>investigated, amongst others, on the Mozambique border.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line1969"><a name="pos1969"></a>weapons were suspected to be brought through the Komatipoort </p>

<p class="line" id="line1979"><a name="pos1979"></a>Andre Laas.  The last three were all under officers.  There </p>
<p class="line" id="line1980"><a name="pos1980"></a>were furthermore Ovambo Koevoet members. These were members </p>
<p class="line" id="line1981"><a name="pos1981"></a>who fought in the Koevoet war in Ovamboland, and they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1982"><a name="pos1982"></a>under the command of the South African Police in South </p>
<p class="line" id="line1983"><a name="pos1983"></a>Africa now.  These were Lucas Khimelo and a certain Simon </p>
<p class="line" id="line1984"><a name="pos1984"></a>Higinbamgwasa - (I don't know how to spell it), as well as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1985"><a name="pos1985"></a>other Black members, whose names I can't remember.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1986"><a name="pos1986"></a>	Information was received that weapons were being </p>
<p class="line" id="line1987"><a name="pos1987"></a>smuggled or would be smuggled for giving them to the ANC and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1988"><a name="pos1988"></a>the PAC across the border, in a white Ford Cortina vehicle. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1989"><a name="pos1989"></a>I cannot remember who told me that the weapons would be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1990"><a name="pos1990"></a>given to the ANC, but I suspected that it was Willie Nortje. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1991"><a name="pos1991"></a> 	The Koevoet members had an appointment with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1992"><a name="pos1992"></a>activists in order to ambush them.   When I speak here of an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1993"><a name="pos1993"></a>ambush, I don't mean an ambush to kill them.  The purpose </p>
<p class="line" id="line1994"><a name="pos1994"></a>was to meet them in a police ambush and to arrest them.  We, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1995"><a name="pos1995"></a>together with the task force members took position next to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1996"><a name="pos1996"></a>the road in the veld. I can perhaps just explain that our </p>
<p class="line" id="line1997"><a name="pos1997"></a>purpose was that when Lucas Khimelo met them on the dirt </p>
<p class="line" id="line1998"><a name="pos1998"></a>road and when they saw the weapons and were paid with cash, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1999"><a name="pos1999"></a>if they gave this cash money to those people, that would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2000"><a name="pos2000"></a>have been the sign and we would have jumped out of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2001"><a name="pos2001"></a>bushes from the side of the road and arrested them.  In the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2002"><a name="pos2002"></a>past we already had already had such operations where they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2003"><a name="pos2003"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2004"><a name="pos2004"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	135	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line2005"><a name="pos2005"></a>were prosecuted in a normal court.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2006"><a name="pos2006"></a>	Lucas Khimelo and the other members of Koevoet waited </p>
<p class="line" id="line2007"><a name="pos2007"></a>in this dirt road.  They had their own vehicle there.  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line2008"><a name="pos2008"></a>would then meet the weapon smugglers there.  Approximately </p>
<p class="line" id="line2009"><a name="pos2009"></a>seven o'clock that evening, this vehicle had not arrived.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2010"><a name="pos2010"></a>The command was given by Willie Nortje that we must retreat </p>
<p class="line" id="line2011"><a name="pos2011"></a>and we went to Schoemaas, that was the police base close-by </p>
<p class="line" id="line2012"><a name="pos2012"></a>where we stayed and we went there to rest.  We started </p>
<p class="line" id="line2013"><a name="pos2013"></a>drinking at the canteen and we used a lot of alcohol.  I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2014"><a name="pos2014"></a>under the influence of alcohol during the further events.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2015"><a name="pos2015"></a>	Later that evening Lucas Khimelo and his members came </p>
<p class="line" id="line2016"><a name="pos2016"></a>back to Schoemaas.  They then first called Lucas Nortje and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2017"><a name="pos2017"></a>somebody else to the side and the others of us were later on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2018"><a name="pos2018"></a>called and we had a meeting.  There were quite many of us, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2019"><a name="pos2019"></a>of Koevoet members from C10, from Vlakplaas as well as task </p>
<p class="line" id="line2020"><a name="pos2020"></a>force members and also the local security branch members.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2021"><a name="pos2021"></a>Later that evening we were told by Lucas Khimelo that him </p>
<p class="line" id="line2022"><a name="pos2022"></a>and the Koevoet members drove into the smugglers.  When they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2023"><a name="pos2023"></a>drove into them the smugglers told them to go into a double </p>
<p class="line" id="line2024"><a name="pos2024"></a>track road because they didn't want to be in the main dirt </p>
<p class="line" id="line2025"><a name="pos2025"></a>road there, because it was carrying heavy traffic.  Khimelo </p>
<p class="line" id="line2026"><a name="pos2026"></a>followed them and told us that the smugglers had weapons in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2027"><a name="pos2027"></a>their car and that they were afraid that they would be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2028"><a name="pos2028"></a>robbed by these people.  They then decided to eliminate </p>
<p class="line" id="line2029"><a name="pos2029"></a>these people by shooting them.  Because the police action </p>
<p class="line" id="line2030"><a name="pos2030"></a>during that stage was sensitive and because C1 Vlakplaas </p>
<p class="line" id="line2031"><a name="pos2031"></a>used ex-Koevoet members, this evoked a lot of criticism from </p>
<p class="line" id="line2032"><a name="pos2032"></a>the National Party and it was a problem.  After the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2033"><a name="pos2033"></a>smugglers have been shot,  Khimelo returned and told us what </p>
<p class="line" id="line2034"><a name="pos2034"></a>had happened.  First Cronje and Klopper and then us. It was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2035"><a name="pos2035"></a>then discussed and we planned the operation.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2038"><a name="pos2038"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Capt Mentz can we stop there please.  Were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2039"><a name="pos2039"></a>you at all involved in the shootings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2040"><a name="pos2040"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, I wasn't, I was only present, I wasn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line2041"><a name="pos2041"></a>present there, I was only present afterwards.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2042"><a name="pos2042"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  In other words what you are saying happened </p>
<p class="line" id="line2043"><a name="pos2043"></a>there, is based on what you heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2044"><a name="pos2044"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2045"><a name="pos2045"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Can you please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2046"><a name="pos2046"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  During this discussion it was decided that it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2047"><a name="pos2047"></a>would create a problem if it was mentioned that the Ovambo </p>
<p class="line" id="line2048"><a name="pos2048"></a>Koevoet members shot the smugglers, because at that stage </p>
<p class="line" id="line2049"><a name="pos2049"></a>there were various rumours that the security police were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2050"><a name="pos2050"></a>involved in so-called Third Force activities and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2051"><a name="pos2051"></a>specifically Vlakplaas, by, amongst others, Dirk Coetzee and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2052"><a name="pos2052"></a>Nofomela.  In other words, the information that came from </p>
<p class="line" id="line2053"><a name="pos2053"></a>this incident would of course place further pressure on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2054"><a name="pos2054"></a>South African Police and the Government.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2055"><a name="pos2055"></a>	At that stage negotiations were started and there were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2056"><a name="pos2056"></a>negotiations between the ANC and the PAC and the National </p>
<p class="line" id="line2057"><a name="pos2057"></a>Party and other such liberation movements. If it came to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2058"><a name="pos2058"></a>knowledge that the NP Government was compromised by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2059"><a name="pos2059"></a>police, it would make the negotiations difficult.  There was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2060"><a name="pos2060"></a>then decided that we had to restructure the operation to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2061"><a name="pos2061"></a>make it seem as if the smugglers were shot by the task force </p>
<p class="line" id="line2062"><a name="pos2062"></a>members.  The reason for that was that they were not accused </p>
<p class="line" id="line2063"><a name="pos2063"></a>of being involved in Third Force activities, but because it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2064"><a name="pos2064"></a>was actually an operational division of the police.   We </p>
<p class="line" id="line2065"><a name="pos2065"></a>didn't want to embarrass the Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2066"><a name="pos2066"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Capt Mentz, if it had been known that this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2067"><a name="pos2067"></a>- if this operation came to the fore, would it have been to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2068"><a name="pos2068"></a>the - would it have been a good thing for the security </p>
<p class="line" id="line2069"><a name="pos2069"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2070"><a name="pos2070"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	137	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line2071"><a name="pos2071"></a>police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2072"><a name="pos2072"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Definitely.  It would have helped the ANC or </p>
<p class="line" id="line2073"><a name="pos2073"></a>the PAC, because it would have shown that while they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2074"><a name="pos2074"></a>negotiating with the Government of the day, that the police </p>
<p class="line" id="line2075"><a name="pos2075"></a>were using ex-Koevoet Ovambo members to eliminate some of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2076"><a name="pos2076"></a>their members.  It would not have been good for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2077"><a name="pos2077"></a>Government of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2078"><a name="pos2078"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Can you go on on page 132, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2079"><a name="pos2079"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  I was then ordered by Lieut Chappies Klopper to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2080"><a name="pos2080"></a>help with the reconstruction of the event, because I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2081"><a name="pos2081"></a>had experience at Murder and Robbery.  I did this.  Nobody </p>
<p class="line" id="line2082"><a name="pos2082"></a>would have believed that weapon smugglers would have sold </p>
<p class="line" id="line2083"><a name="pos2083"></a>weapons to five white men.  Therefore, the car was taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line2084"><a name="pos2084"></a>back to the main road. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2085"><a name="pos2085"></a>	These people were shot in a small double track road and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2086"><a name="pos2086"></a>we decided that the story would have been that we were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2087"><a name="pos2087"></a>waiting in the vehicle until the white Cortina came back. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2088"><a name="pos2088"></a>The informant said this specifically that it would have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line2089"><a name="pos2089"></a>a Cortina.  We then would follow the white Cortina and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2090"><a name="pos2090"></a>would have approached the vehicle from the back.  We would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2091"><a name="pos2091"></a>also say that we were shot on from the vehicle and that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2092"><a name="pos2092"></a>shot, then shot back. It would then be said that the four </p>
<p class="line" id="line2093"><a name="pos2093"></a>people in the vehicle were killed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2094"><a name="pos2094"></a>	In the boot we found various illegal weapons, amongst </p>
<p class="line" id="line2095"><a name="pos2095"></a>others, AK47 weapons, an RPG7 and also RPK and Makorov </p>
<p class="line" id="line2096"><a name="pos2096"></a>pistols.  The four bodies were taken out and put in our </p>
<p class="line" id="line2097"><a name="pos2097"></a>mini-bus.  We had a combi mini-bus so the four bodies were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2098"><a name="pos2098"></a>put upon, on top of each other in the back and a blanket was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2099"><a name="pos2099"></a>thrown over them.  The cartridges were picked up and we then </p>
<p class="line" id="line2100"><a name="pos2100"></a>left them.   We took the empty cartridges to the road and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2101"><a name="pos2101"></a>left them there.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2103"><a name="pos2103"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	138	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line2104"><a name="pos2104"></a>	We then went to Schoemaas with the four bodies.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line2105"><a name="pos2105"></a>didn't go into Schoemaas, but we only hooted at the gate and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2106"><a name="pos2106"></a>they came.  They knew that we would find them, see them in a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2107"><a name="pos2107"></a>house at the back of Schoemaas.  We waited for Willie Nortje </p>
<p class="line" id="line2108"><a name="pos2108"></a>and Chappies Klopper to join us there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2109"><a name="pos2109"></a>	While we were waiting somebody, I can't remember who, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2110"><a name="pos2110"></a>made the remark in a joke that one is still living.  These </p>
<p class="line" id="line2111"><a name="pos2111"></a>bodies were put one upon the other.  There was a blanket </p>
<p class="line" id="line2112"><a name="pos2112"></a>over them. It was very dark.  We stopped next to the house. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2113"><a name="pos2113"></a>I took out my pistol and shot at one of the bodies. It must </p>
<p class="line" id="line2114"><a name="pos2114"></a>have been the top body.  It was dark and I could not see. I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2115"><a name="pos2115"></a>could not see who I shot or where I shot that person, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2116"><a name="pos2116"></a>although I hit the body. I don't know exactly where.  At </p>
<p class="line" id="line2117"><a name="pos2117"></a>that stage I was certain that all of them were dead.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2118"><a name="pos2118"></a>	My actions there I can describe as very tense and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2119"><a name="pos2119"></a>drunk, irrational, something I would not normally have done. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2120"><a name="pos2120"></a>I was so frustrated and angry at these people who brought in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2121"><a name="pos2121"></a>the weapons, still while we were negotiating - while there </p>
<p class="line" id="line2122"><a name="pos2122"></a>were negotiations going on.  I was very drunk and angry and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2123"><a name="pos2123"></a>frustrated. I did this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2124"><a name="pos2124"></a>	The shot I fired did not cause any injury or death. I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2125"><a name="pos2125"></a>was under the influence of liquor. I would not have done </p>
<p class="line" id="line2126"><a name="pos2126"></a>this under normal circumstances.  The bodies were then taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line2127"><a name="pos2127"></a>to the mortuary in Komatipoort.  The bodies were taken to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2128"><a name="pos2128"></a>the mortuary.  A dossier was opened. I then made an </p>
<p class="line" id="line2129"><a name="pos2129"></a>affidavit on this, which was not a true and correct </p>
<p class="line" id="line2130"><a name="pos2130"></a>explanation of the event.  It was done for the reasons </p>

<p class="line" id="line2149"><a name="pos2149"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  In the third line.  The original operation was </p>

<p class="line" id="line2151"><a name="pos2151"></a>and in the "in" must be "to".  </p>

<p class="line" id="line2156"><a name="pos2156"></a>believed that Eugene de Kock would have approved these </p>
<p class="line" id="line2157"><a name="pos2157"></a>orders, because I knew that Willie Nortje called De Kock </p>

<p class="line" id="line2170"><a name="pos2170"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Does the charge sheet give the names of all </p>
<p class="line" id="line2171"><a name="pos2171"></a>four people who had been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2172"><a name="pos2172"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, perhaps I will have a look, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2173"><a name="pos2173"></a>have it in my possession.  If the cross-examination can go </p>
<p class="line" id="line2174"><a name="pos2174"></a>on, I will look for it and I will give you an indication.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2175"><a name="pos2175"></a>don't think so, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2176"><a name="pos2176"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Mr Mpshe, are there any questions you would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2177"><a name="pos2177"></a>like to put to this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2178"><a name="pos2178"></a>ADV MPSHE:  I don't have questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2179"><a name="pos2179"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2180"><a name="pos2180"></a>JUDGE MALL:  You have referred to these persons who are </p>
<p class="line" id="line2181"><a name="pos2181"></a>bringing the arms in as smugglers, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2182"><a name="pos2182"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That's correct, Mr Chair, smugglers of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2183"><a name="pos2183"></a>liberation movements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2184"><a name="pos2184"></a>JUDGE MALL:  I want to know why you say they were smugglers </p>
<p class="line" id="line2185"><a name="pos2185"></a>of the liberation movements, what proof is there that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2186"><a name="pos2186"></a>were smuggling for the liberation movement and were not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2187"><a name="pos2187"></a>people who were merely selling arms to the highest bidder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2188"><a name="pos2188"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, I know that some of these people we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2189"><a name="pos2189"></a>questioned in the past, said that these weapons were going </p>
<p class="line" id="line2190"><a name="pos2190"></a>to Natal for attacks on Inkatha, and people were arrested on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2191"><a name="pos2191"></a>the East Rand who had of these weapons in their possession. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2192"><a name="pos2192"></a> They, during questioning, said that they give it to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2193"><a name="pos2193"></a>liberation movements. I did not speak to these specific </p>
<p class="line" id="line2194"><a name="pos2194"></a>four, but I believe it was concerning this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2195"><a name="pos2195"></a>JUDGE MALL:  They may be lying of course, they may be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2196"><a name="pos2196"></a>running a business, selling arms to people who want to buy </p>
<p class="line" id="line2197"><a name="pos2197"></a>them, to ordinary criminals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2198"><a name="pos2198"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is possible, Mr Chairman, some of these </p>
<p class="line" id="line2199"><a name="pos2199"></a>people were also found guilty in different cases, but it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2200"><a name="pos2200"></a>possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2201"><a name="pos2201"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2202"><a name="pos2202"></a>JUDGE WILSON	141	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line2203"><a name="pos2203"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Found guilty of what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2204"><a name="pos2204"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Possession of weapons and selling weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2205"><a name="pos2205"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  The questions asked mean that if that - would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2206"><a name="pos2206"></a>that person not possibly have supplied me with those weapons </p>
<p class="line" id="line2207"><a name="pos2207"></a>if I offered them a higher price?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2208"><a name="pos2208"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, Mr Chair, they would definitely or </p>
<p class="line" id="line2209"><a name="pos2209"></a>certainly not have sold weapons to anybody.  We got onto </p>
<p class="line" id="line2210"><a name="pos2210"></a>them because of informants, who - Nortje handled them </p>
<p class="line" id="line2211"><a name="pos2211"></a>through Khimelo. They would not have sold to strange people. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2212"><a name="pos2212"></a> They would have had to contact informants.  But if we did </p>
<p class="line" id="line2213"><a name="pos2213"></a>this, it would have been possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2214"><a name="pos2214"></a>JUDGE MALL:  If a warlord or leader of a gang was interested </p>
<p class="line" id="line2215"><a name="pos2215"></a>in getting arms, and made contact, he would be supplied arms </p>
<p class="line" id="line2216"><a name="pos2216"></a>by these smugglers wouldn't he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2217"><a name="pos2217"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, it is possible, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2218"><a name="pos2218"></a>JUDGE MALL:  And is there nothing to say that on this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2219"><a name="pos2219"></a>occasion the arms that were being smuggled were for the ANC </p>
<p class="line" id="line2220"><a name="pos2220"></a>on this occasion or the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2221"><a name="pos2221"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, I could not say specifically for whom </p>
<p class="line" id="line2222"><a name="pos2222"></a>these weapons were intended.  They might just as well have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2223"><a name="pos2223"></a>gone to Inkatha.  Furthermore, in my application before the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2224"><a name="pos2224"></a>Commission I also apply for a certain event where we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2225"><a name="pos2225"></a>received weapons from Inkatha, but from a specific person. I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2226"><a name="pos2226"></a>believe that these weapons were going for a militant freedom </p>
<p class="line" id="line2227"><a name="pos2227"></a>organisation.  The political parties murdered each other on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2228"><a name="pos2228"></a>the trains and everywhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2229"><a name="pos2229"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  As I understand the evidence, your evidence, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2230"><a name="pos2230"></a>your agents were going to buy these guns from these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2231"><a name="pos2231"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, and then arrest them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2232"><a name="pos2232"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  So they were not bringing the guns in to give </p>
<p class="line" id="line2233"><a name="pos2233"></a>to known ANC or other activists whom they knew, they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2234"><a name="pos2234"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2235"><a name="pos2235"></a>JUDGE WILSON	142	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line2236"><a name="pos2236"></a>prepared to sell them and they were going to sell them to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2237"><a name="pos2237"></a>your agents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2238"><a name="pos2238"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Our people pretended to be members of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2239"><a name="pos2239"></a>political party. I was not there when they spoke with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2240"><a name="pos2240"></a>JUDGE MALL:  That opens up all kinds of possibilities. If </p>
<p class="line" id="line2241"><a name="pos2241"></a>your agents could have easily bought guns from them, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2242"><a name="pos2242"></a>suppliers don't seem to be particularly concerned about who </p>
<p class="line" id="line2243"><a name="pos2243"></a>they were going to sell to.  They weren't going to ask proof </p>
<p class="line" id="line2244"><a name="pos2244"></a>from your agents whether they were members of the ANC or </p>
<p class="line" id="line2245"><a name="pos2245"></a>PAC?  They were quite happy to sell them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2246"><a name="pos2246"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That might be the case, but I believe that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2247"><a name="pos2247"></a>weapons were going to the ANC, the PAC or Inkatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2248"><a name="pos2248"></a>JUDGE MALL:  No, I don't understand it when you say you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2249"><a name="pos2249"></a>believe it, we are now trying to test the reasonableness of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2250"><a name="pos2250"></a>your belief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2251"><a name="pos2251"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  You can't have believed they were going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2252"><a name="pos2252"></a>them.  Haven't you told us that you set up an ambush, a trap </p>
<p class="line" id="line2253"><a name="pos2253"></a>but when they bought the weapons the money was handed over, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2254"><a name="pos2254"></a>you are going to jump out and arrest them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2255"><a name="pos2255"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is correct, Mr Chair, and we could have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2256"><a name="pos2256"></a>interrogated further to find out to whom these weapons were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2257"><a name="pos2257"></a>really going.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2258"><a name="pos2258"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  No the weapons were going to be sold there, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2259"><a name="pos2259"></a>in front of your eyes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2260"><a name="pos2260"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, Mr Chair, we would have arrested them and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2261"><a name="pos2261"></a>we could have questioned them further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2262"><a name="pos2262"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Instead of which you went off and had a party </p>
<p class="line" id="line2263"><a name="pos2263"></a>again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2264"><a name="pos2264"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, the operation was then cancelled. It </p>
<p class="line" id="line2265"><a name="pos2265"></a>would not have continued.  We then went, we had a braai and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2266"><a name="pos2266"></a>we drank. That was all that we could do at Komatipoort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2267"><a name="pos2267"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2268"><a name="pos2268"></a>JUDGE MALL	143	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line2269"><a name="pos2269"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Who gave instructions to the leader of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2270"><a name="pos2270"></a>Koevoet from your group, or under whose orders were Koevoet </p>
<p class="line" id="line2271"><a name="pos2271"></a>acting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2272"><a name="pos2272"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  They were divided at Vlakplaas into certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line2273"><a name="pos2273"></a>units.  They were under the command of Gen De Kock at C10.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2274"><a name="pos2274"></a>There were also other ex-Koevoet members who were used as </p>
<p class="line" id="line2275"><a name="pos2275"></a>trackers at other branches.  All of them weren't with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2276"><a name="pos2276"></a>JUDGE MALL:  I'm talking about this particular occasion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2277"><a name="pos2277"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, may I just point out and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2278"><a name="pos2278"></a>should have done that perhaps at the beginning.  Amnesty is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2279"><a name="pos2279"></a>not sought for murder in this matter.  Amnesty is simply </p>
<p class="line" id="line2280"><a name="pos2280"></a>sought for being an accessory after the fact for - for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2281"><a name="pos2281"></a>perjury and obstruction of justice. I am just making that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2282"><a name="pos2282"></a>point Mr Chairman because of the fact that we are not asking </p>
<p class="line" id="line2283"><a name="pos2283"></a>for amnesty for murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2284"><a name="pos2284"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, they were under the command of Lieut </p>
<p class="line" id="line2285"><a name="pos2285"></a>Klopper and Nortje.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2286"><a name="pos2286"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Is it therefore reasonable to conclude that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2287"><a name="pos2287"></a>when these people were killed by the Koevoet, they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2288"><a name="pos2288"></a>acting under instructions from Klopper or Nortje?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2289"><a name="pos2289"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Mr Chair, it is difficult to tell, because </p>
<p class="line" id="line2290"><a name="pos2290"></a>Nortje was with me and some of the other task force members </p>
<p class="line" id="line2291"><a name="pos2291"></a>before they were shot, we were together.  We then withdrew. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2292"><a name="pos2292"></a> I do not know what orders Nortje gave them further on, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line2293"><a name="pos2293"></a>I think they acted on their own, on the spur of the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2294"><a name="pos2294"></a>JUDGE MALL:   What about Klopper?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2295"><a name="pos2295"></a>CAPT MENTZ:   To my knowledge, I can't remember whether </p>
<p class="line" id="line2296"><a name="pos2296"></a>Klopper later spoke with them before these people were shot. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2297"><a name="pos2297"></a> It might be the case but I have no knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2298"><a name="pos2298"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:   I understand you to say that you helped in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2299"><a name="pos2299"></a>covering up this incident because you were worried that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2300"><a name="pos2300"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2301"><a name="pos2301"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE	144	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line2302"><a name="pos2302"></a>disclosure thereof would have embarrassed or weakened the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2303"><a name="pos2303"></a>Government, or being to the advantage of the ANC or PAC </p>
<p class="line" id="line2304"><a name="pos2304"></a>during negotiations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2305"><a name="pos2305"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2306"><a name="pos2306"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  What I don't understand is, why would that be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2307"><a name="pos2307"></a>so?  The people killed would have been simply arms </p>
<p class="line" id="line2308"><a name="pos2308"></a>smugglers. How can that - I am trying to wonder whether </p>
<p class="line" id="line2309"><a name="pos2309"></a>everybody in the country would not have been happy that arms </p>
<p class="line" id="line2310"><a name="pos2310"></a>smugglers were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2311"><a name="pos2311"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, Mr Chair, if I remember correctly, it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2312"><a name="pos2312"></a>in the news and in the newspapers that the Government </p>
<p class="line" id="line2313"><a name="pos2313"></a>allowed that ex-Koevoet members, Ovambos, operated with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2314"><a name="pos2314"></a>security branch and specifically Vlakplaas and Vlakplaas' </p>
<p class="line" id="line2315"><a name="pos2315"></a>reputation how they could go and shoot these people.  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line2316"><a name="pos2316"></a>didn't want - they didn't want the police to employ these </p>
<p class="line" id="line2317"><a name="pos2317"></a>ex-Ovambo members, but it was still done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2318"><a name="pos2318"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  In fact I think the feelings were very strong </p>
<p class="line" id="line2319"><a name="pos2319"></a>against these Koevoet members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2320"><a name="pos2320"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2321"><a name="pos2321"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  So basically when you discovered the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2322"><a name="pos2322"></a>Vlakplaas people had killed them, it was a cover-up now for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2323"><a name="pos2323"></a>the security police and Vlakplaas - the Koevoet people who </p>
<p class="line" id="line2324"><a name="pos2324"></a>killed them, sorry.   When the Koevoet people came back and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2325"><a name="pos2325"></a>said they had killed them, you covered up to save the name </p>
<p class="line" id="line2326"><a name="pos2326"></a>of the security police and Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2327"><a name="pos2327"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2328"><a name="pos2328"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Could you please explain to us, members of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2329"><a name="pos2329"></a>Koevoet were members who - were they South African citizens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2330"><a name="pos2330"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Some of them, but not all of them.  The South </p>
<p class="line" id="line2331"><a name="pos2331"></a>African white policemen who served in Ovamboland, like in my </p>
<p class="line" id="line2332"><a name="pos2332"></a>case, I went for three months at a time, and we were a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2333"><a name="pos2333"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2334"><a name="pos2334"></a>ADV DE JAGER	145	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line2335"><a name="pos2335"></a>normal counter-insurgence unit, some of these members then </p>
<p class="line" id="line2336"><a name="pos2336"></a>applied for staying there for very long, for a year or two </p>
<p class="line" id="line2337"><a name="pos2337"></a>years, and they were then members of the Koevoet team.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line2338"><a name="pos2338"></a>When I say Ovambo members, they were members from South West </p>
<p class="line" id="line2339"><a name="pos2339"></a>- now Namibia.  They then also worked with the tin units, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2340"><a name="pos2340"></a>the counter-insurgence units.  They could - they were very </p>
<p class="line" id="line2341"><a name="pos2341"></a>good at warfare.  There were also Ovambo members, together </p>
<p class="line" id="line2342"><a name="pos2342"></a>with Koevoet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2343"><a name="pos2343"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Were there in South Africa feelings against </p>
<p class="line" id="line2344"><a name="pos2344"></a>Koevoet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2345"><a name="pos2345"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2346"><a name="pos2346"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Were they regarded as members of a Third </p>
<p class="line" id="line2347"><a name="pos2347"></a>Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2348"><a name="pos2348"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2349"><a name="pos2349"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  And now if you covered this event up, was it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2350"><a name="pos2350"></a>for the protection of Koevoet or for the protection of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2351"><a name="pos2351"></a>Government, in whose service they were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2352"><a name="pos2352"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  The security police, the police and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2353"><a name="pos2353"></a>Government in whose service they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2354"><a name="pos2354"></a>JUDGE MALL:  	Did I understand your answer to be that your </p>
<p class="line" id="line2355"><a name="pos2355"></a>action was taken in the interest of the South African </p>
<p class="line" id="line2356"><a name="pos2356"></a>Government and the South African Police?  Is that what you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2357"><a name="pos2357"></a>are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2358"><a name="pos2358"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, the security police, the police as a whole </p>
<p class="line" id="line2359"><a name="pos2359"></a>and the police who pursued the objectives of the Government </p>
<p class="line" id="line2360"><a name="pos2360"></a>of the day, which was the National Party Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2361"><a name="pos2361"></a>JUDGE MALL:  But if you were directly implicating and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2362"><a name="pos2362"></a>holding out to the world that this action was performed by </p>
<p class="line" id="line2363"><a name="pos2363"></a>the police, by the South African Police or a Vlakplaas unit, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2364"><a name="pos2364"></a>if that is what you were going to hold out to the world how </p>
<p class="line" id="line2365"><a name="pos2365"></a>was that protecting the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2366"><a name="pos2366"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2367"><a name="pos2367"></a>JUDGE MALL	146	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line2368"><a name="pos2368"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  The false plan which we had was to say that it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2369"><a name="pos2369"></a>was the task force, the special operational unit which had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2370"><a name="pos2370"></a>shot these people. Then no questions would have been asked. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2371"><a name="pos2371"></a> But the moment you mention that it was Koevoet members or </p>
<p class="line" id="line2372"><a name="pos2372"></a>Vlakplaas members, then it was a problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2373"><a name="pos2373"></a>RE-EXAMINATION BY ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2374"><a name="pos2374"></a>At that stage were the actions of specially the Vlakplaas </p>
<p class="line" id="line2375"><a name="pos2375"></a>unit,was it still directed against the liberation movements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2376"><a name="pos2376"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2377"><a name="pos2377"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  And the Vlakplaas involvement in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2378"><a name="pos2378"></a>event, if that was disclosed, would that have a prejudicial </p>
<p class="line" id="line2379"><a name="pos2379"></a>effect on the Vlakplaas operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2380"><a name="pos2380"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  I believe so, because if I remember correctly, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2381"><a name="pos2381"></a> just after this it was insisted that people such as De Kock </p>
<p class="line" id="line2382"><a name="pos2382"></a>and other persons who were known to the ANC, that they had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2383"><a name="pos2383"></a>to leave the police. I think it was one of the ANC's </p>
<p class="line" id="line2384"><a name="pos2384"></a>requirements for further negotiations, and that in fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line2385"><a name="pos2385"></a>happened, they packages and our unit was disbanded just </p>
<p class="line" id="line2386"><a name="pos2386"></a>after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2387"><a name="pos2387"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Capt Mentz on page 129, the bottom </p>
<p class="line" id="line2388"><a name="pos2388"></a>paragraph, you said that information was received that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2389"><a name="pos2389"></a>weapons were smuggled for making available to the ANC and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2390"><a name="pos2390"></a>the PAC across the border, in a white Ford Cortina. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2391"><a name="pos2391"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  I can't remember who told me that the weapons </p>
<p class="line" id="line2392"><a name="pos2392"></a>would be made available to the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2393"><a name="pos2393"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  But you think that it was Willie Nortje?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2394"><a name="pos2394"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2395"><a name="pos2395"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Now you have conceded that there is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2396"><a name="pos2396"></a>possibility that these people could have sold weapons to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2397"><a name="pos2397"></a>other people. Now I want to ask you, what do you, in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2398"><a name="pos2398"></a>light of what you can remember, what was told to you, what </p>
<p class="line" id="line2399"><a name="pos2399"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2400"><a name="pos2400"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	147	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line2401"><a name="pos2401"></a>was more probable,  would they have sold weapons to private </p>
<p class="line" id="line2402"><a name="pos2402"></a>people or was it more probable that they would have sold </p>
<p class="line" id="line2403"><a name="pos2403"></a>weapons to supporters of freedom fighters and movements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2404"><a name="pos2404"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  No, they would rather - if they didn't sell it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2405"><a name="pos2405"></a>to trained terrorists, they would have sold it to street </p>
<p class="line" id="line2406"><a name="pos2406"></a>committees, the self-defence units and those kinds of bodies </p>
<p class="line" id="line2407"><a name="pos2407"></a>and people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2408"><a name="pos2408"></a>JUDGE MALL:  We are talking about this particular </p>
<p class="line" id="line2409"><a name="pos2409"></a>consignment, not generally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2410"><a name="pos2410"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  No, this particular consignment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2411"><a name="pos2411"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2412"><a name="pos2412"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, this particular one.  We are speaking </p>
<p class="line" id="line2413"><a name="pos2413"></a>of this specific consignment of weapons. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2414"><a name="pos2414"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, I believed that the weapons were going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2415"><a name="pos2415"></a>these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2416"><a name="pos2416"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Can I take you to page 132, the last two </p>
<p class="line" id="line2417"><a name="pos2417"></a>sentences of the first paragraph, the middle of the page, it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2418"><a name="pos2418"></a>starts with "the reason for that".  The last two sentences </p>
<p class="line" id="line2419"><a name="pos2419"></a>of the first paragraph.  It is on page 132, it starts with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2420"><a name="pos2420"></a>the words "the reason for that".  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2421"><a name="pos2421"></a>CAPT MENTZ:   The reason for that was that they were not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2422"><a name="pos2422"></a>accused of Third Force activities and they were actually the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2423"><a name="pos2423"></a>operational section.  There was already a kind of a stigma </p>
<p class="line" id="line2424"><a name="pos2424"></a>attached to Vlakplaas at the time that they were involved in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2425"><a name="pos2425"></a>Third Force activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2426"><a name="pos2426"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV DU PLESSIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line2427"><a name="pos2427"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Thank you, you are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2428"><a name="pos2428"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, before the witness is excused. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2429"><a name="pos2429"></a> In respect of the matter of Brian Ngqulunga, we did some </p>
<p class="line" id="line2430"><a name="pos2430"></a>research and we got hold of parts of the record of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2431"><a name="pos2431"></a>evidence in the Eugene de Kock trial, and we also are going </p>
<p class="line" id="line2432"><a name="pos2432"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2433"><a name="pos2433"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	148	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line2434"><a name="pos2434"></a>to be placed in possession this evening of the excerpts of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2435"><a name="pos2435"></a>Ngqulunga's evidence before the Harms Commission, which we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2436"><a name="pos2436"></a>deem important for this Committee.  Now I have in my </p>
<p class="line" id="line2437"><a name="pos2437"></a>possession bundles of the evidence in the De Kock trial, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2438"><a name="pos2438"></a>especially, well, actually the evidence of Warrant Officer </p>
<p class="line" id="line2439"><a name="pos2439"></a>Nortje.  I intend to hand that in to the Committee, but what </p>
<p class="line" id="line2440"><a name="pos2440"></a>I want to do, Mr Chairman, and it is going to be very short, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2441"><a name="pos2441"></a>is refer you to one or two pages in the evidence and ask </p>
<p class="line" id="line2442"><a name="pos2442"></a>Capt Mentz's commentary on that, if you will allow me to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2443"><a name="pos2443"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Is Nortje going to come to give evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2444"><a name="pos2444"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Pardon, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2445"><a name="pos2445"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Will Nortje be coming to give evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2446"><a name="pos2446"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  He is a State witness, Mr Chairman, I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line2447"><a name="pos2447"></a>not sure - not in this application.  Not in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2448"><a name="pos2448"></a>application. He is a State witness, I am not sure if he is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2449"><a name="pos2449"></a>applying for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2450"><a name="pos2450"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Don't know whether he has.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2451"><a name="pos2451"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Or whether he has, I don't know.  But as </p>
<p class="line" id="line2452"><a name="pos2452"></a>far as I know all State witnesses did apply for amnesty, so </p>
<p class="line" id="line2453"><a name="pos2453"></a>we can accept that he probably did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2454"><a name="pos2454"></a>JUDGE MALL:  You would like to put portions of the evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line2455"><a name="pos2455"></a>given by Nortje in that case to this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2456"><a name="pos2456"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, I just want his comments.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2457"><a name="pos2457"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2458"><a name="pos2458"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  I want his comments on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2459"><a name="pos2459"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Does it affect him or implicate him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2460"><a name="pos2460"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  There is mention of him in the evidence, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2461"><a name="pos2461"></a>Chairman. I may mention - perhaps I can give you an idea of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2462"><a name="pos2462"></a>the purpose thereof, and if the Committee doesn't deem it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2463"><a name="pos2463"></a>important or necessary, then we can dispense with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2464"><a name="pos2464"></a>	There are two aspects which become clear from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2465"><a name="pos2465"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2466"><a name="pos2466"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	149	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line2467"><a name="pos2467"></a>evidence.  The first one is that there was a plan to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2468"><a name="pos2468"></a>eliminate Ngqulunga, apparently and that was the - what Capt </p>
<p class="line" id="line2469"><a name="pos2469"></a>Mentz testified about that he heard later, apparently </p>
<p class="line" id="line2470"><a name="pos2470"></a>because there was a worry that he would become scared </p>
<p class="line" id="line2471"><a name="pos2471"></a>because of the false evidence that he gave in front of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2472"><a name="pos2472"></a>Harms Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2473"><a name="pos2473"></a>	Nortje also secondly, confirms the fact that there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2474"><a name="pos2474"></a>a second reason for killing Ngqulunga,  and that is that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2475"><a name="pos2475"></a>was a person who was giving information to the ANC.  He does </p>
<p class="line" id="line2476"><a name="pos2476"></a>refer in his evidence to that fact.  I can point that out to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2477"><a name="pos2477"></a>you.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2478"><a name="pos2478"></a>	Then thirdly, the evidence indicates that people high </p>
<p class="line" id="line2479"><a name="pos2479"></a>up in the security headquarters knew exactly what happened </p>
<p class="line" id="line2480"><a name="pos2480"></a>in this incident, with Ngqulunga.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2481"><a name="pos2481"></a>	Fourthly, Mr Chairman - pardon, I lost the point now.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2482"><a name="pos2482"></a>If you could just bear with me.  If you could just bear with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2483"><a name="pos2483"></a>me, Mr Chairman.  Oh, the last point was that there is also </p>
<p class="line" id="line2484"><a name="pos2484"></a>evidence in this record pertaining to the fact that De Kock </p>
<p class="line" id="line2485"><a name="pos2485"></a>wanted the people who were involved in this matter, that is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2486"><a name="pos2486"></a>Bellingham, Botha, Baker and Mentz, and especially Baker and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2487"><a name="pos2487"></a>Bellingham, to be tied up with an incident such as this, so </p>
<p class="line" id="line2488"><a name="pos2488"></a>as to have a hold over them.  That is the gist of what I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2489"><a name="pos2489"></a>wanted his comments on. I can, however, just hand it in and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2490"><a name="pos2490"></a>deal with that in argument, if the Committee doesn't deem it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2491"><a name="pos2491"></a>necessary to hear any evidence on this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2492"><a name="pos2492"></a>JUDGE MALL:  I think you may proceed by putting that to your </p>
<p class="line" id="line2493"><a name="pos2493"></a>witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2494"><a name="pos2494"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you, Mr Chairman. May I beg leave to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2495"><a name="pos2495"></a>hand up sets of the copies of the record of Nortje's </p>
<p class="line" id="line2496"><a name="pos2496"></a>evidence.  It is thick but I am going to refer you to just </p>
<p class="line" id="line2497"><a name="pos2497"></a>the relevant pages.  That would be, I think EXHIBIT AA, Mr </p>

<p class="line" id="line2501"><a name="pos2501"></a>EXHIBIT AA HANDED IN</p>
<p class="line" id="line2502"><a name="pos2502"></a>	Mr Chairman, I want to place on record that I haven't </p>
<p class="line" id="line2503"><a name="pos2503"></a>provided Mr Mpshe with a copy of this, which I perhaps </p>
<p class="line" id="line2504"><a name="pos2504"></a>should have done earlier in this week and it is my mistake </p>
<p class="line" id="line2505"><a name="pos2505"></a>that I didn't do that. If he needs to ask any questions </p>
<p class="line" id="line2506"><a name="pos2506"></a>about that, he has got a problem with that, then that's my </p>
<p class="line" id="line2507"><a name="pos2507"></a>fault.  May I proceed, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2508"><a name="pos2508"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes, sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2509"><a name="pos2509"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, am I correct that this is </p>

<p class="line" id="line2512"><a name="pos2512"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2513"><a name="pos2513"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Exhibit AA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2514"><a name="pos2514"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Capt Mentz, could we turn to page 7 of this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2515"><a name="pos2515"></a>volume.  I would like you to read the second last paragraph </p>
<p class="line" id="line2516"><a name="pos2516"></a>of Warrant Officer Nortje's evidence.  He says he would like </p>
<p class="line" id="line2517"><a name="pos2517"></a>to also tie up Bellingham and Baker to certain incidents, on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2518"><a name="pos2518"></a>the next page, because they are not yet directly involved.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2519"><a name="pos2519"></a>They haven't as yet been contaminated, as we called it, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2520"><a name="pos2520"></a>he decided that the two of them - he would use the two of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2521"><a name="pos2521"></a>them.  Actually he went for Baker.  And then he says </p>
<p class="line" id="line2522"><a name="pos2522"></a>further, and he then gave them instruction, after we rented </p>
<p class="line" id="line2523"><a name="pos2523"></a>the combis, or they knew that they were going with.  He then </p>
<p class="line" id="line2524"><a name="pos2524"></a>called in Wouter Mentz and Piet Botha.   Mentz had just been </p>
<p class="line" id="line2525"><a name="pos2525"></a>transferred from Murder and Robbery at that stage.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line2526"><a name="pos2526"></a>hadn't been there for very long.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2527"><a name="pos2527"></a>	Now could you comment on this for the Committee, about </p>
<p class="line" id="line2528"><a name="pos2528"></a>the whole issue of the contamination and the purpose and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2529"><a name="pos2529"></a>whole modus operandi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2530"><a name="pos2530"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Chairperson, I don't know why De Kock gave </p>

<p class="line" id="line2532"><a name="pos2532"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	151	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line2533"><a name="pos2533"></a>Baker and Bellingham these instructions and that he wanted </p>
<p class="line" id="line2534"><a name="pos2534"></a>to contaminate them.  I don't have any knowledge of that.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2535"><a name="pos2535"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Could I ask you, were you aware of the fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line2536"><a name="pos2536"></a>that that was the way in which De Kock operated, to involve </p>
<p class="line" id="line2537"><a name="pos2537"></a>people in certain events, to contaminate them as such?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2538"><a name="pos2538"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, I misunderstood, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2539"><a name="pos2539"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Now in your case, if you were involved in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2540"><a name="pos2540"></a>certain events, would it have created a problem for you, if </p>
<p class="line" id="line2541"><a name="pos2541"></a>you wanted to leave Vlakplaas or to talk about what happened </p>
<p class="line" id="line2542"><a name="pos2542"></a>there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2543"><a name="pos2543"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  It would, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2544"><a name="pos2544"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Good I then take you to page 25. In the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2545"><a name="pos2545"></a>middle of that page the question was asked do you know </p>
<p class="line" id="line2546"><a name="pos2546"></a>whether people higher up knew of that?   I believe they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2547"><a name="pos2547"></a>would have been informed there, must have been informed. Is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2548"><a name="pos2548"></a>that in line with your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2549"><a name="pos2549"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  My page 25 is blank for the top half of the </p>

<p class="line" id="line2557"><a name="pos2557"></a>paragraph, "vanwaar af" - from Brig Van Rensburg's side who </p>
<p class="line" id="line2558"><a name="pos2558"></a>was then the commanding officer, and do you know where the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2559"><a name="pos2559"></a>people higher than him knew of this?  I believe that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2560"><a name="pos2560"></a>would have been so informed, they must have been informed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2561"><a name="pos2561"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  If you read the previous one it reads as an </p>
<p class="line" id="line2562"><a name="pos2562"></a>instruction and the question was where did the instruction </p>
<p class="line" id="line2563"><a name="pos2563"></a>come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2564"><a name="pos2564"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2565"><a name="pos2565"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	152	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line2566"><a name="pos2566"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, I would have rectified that now.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line2567"><a name="pos2567"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  This deals with the instruction and where </p>
<p class="line" id="line2568"><a name="pos2568"></a>it came from.  Is that in line with how you remember it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2569"><a name="pos2569"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2570"><a name="pos2570"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  And then the next question was, what, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2571"><a name="pos2571"></a>according to you, was the reason why Brian Ngqulunga had to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2572"><a name="pos2572"></a>be eliminated and the answer, because he wanted to talk </p>
<p class="line" id="line2573"><a name="pos2573"></a>about Mxenge from Durban. That is one of the reasons.  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line2574"><a name="pos2574"></a>have already testified about that, that you were not aware </p>
<p class="line" id="line2575"><a name="pos2575"></a>of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2576"><a name="pos2576"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes, I didn't know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2577"><a name="pos2577"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Then he says Mxenge and on the next page he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2578"><a name="pos2578"></a>says yes, let us assume that, let us accept that.  He has </p>
<p class="line" id="line2579"><a name="pos2579"></a>already testified to that before the Harms Commission?  That </p>
<p class="line" id="line2580"><a name="pos2580"></a>is correct.  And on which occasion he also denied his </p>
<p class="line" id="line2581"><a name="pos2581"></a>involvement of that.  The answer was that is correct.  And </p>
<p class="line" id="line2582"><a name="pos2582"></a>then Capt Mentz you said that information came from </p>
<p class="line" id="line2583"><a name="pos2583"></a>elsewhere, not from C1, but from elsewhere, that this man </p>
<p class="line" id="line2584"><a name="pos2584"></a>had possibly changed tactics and went to talk to the ANC and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2585"><a name="pos2585"></a>Nortje said that is correct, that's how I understood it.  Is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2586"><a name="pos2586"></a>that in line with the information which you had received </p>
<p class="line" id="line2587"><a name="pos2587"></a>relating to the reason for Brian Ngqulunga's elimination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2588"><a name="pos2588"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2589"><a name="pos2589"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  And then it said, and from the top the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2590"><a name="pos2590"></a>decision was taken that he must be eliminated.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2591"><a name="pos2591"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2592"><a name="pos2592"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Just bear with me, please, Mr Chairman.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2593"><a name="pos2593"></a>Capt Mentz, just to complete the picture here, on page 45 </p>
<p class="line" id="line2594"><a name="pos2594"></a>from 21, lines 21 to the next page 22, there is once again </p>
<p class="line" id="line2595"><a name="pos2595"></a>evidence about the contamination.  Mr Chairman, I am just </p>
<p class="line" id="line2596"><a name="pos2596"></a>drawing your attention to this, I have already asked the </p>

<p class="line" id="line2605"><a name="pos2605"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   And then on page 48 from line 12, there </p>
<p class="line" id="line2606"><a name="pos2606"></a>Nortje is testifying about the question of whether you had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2607"><a name="pos2607"></a>been contaminated.  The question was:  did it justify the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2608"><a name="pos2608"></a>choice of Mentz, motivate?  No, but Mentz had just arrived </p>
<p class="line" id="line2609"><a name="pos2609"></a>from Murder and Robbery at that stage and he had not yet </p>
<p class="line" id="line2610"><a name="pos2610"></a>been contaminated.  Yes, well, I suppose he was, but I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line2611"><a name="pos2611"></a>know whether he knew that he had done something wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2612"><a name="pos2612"></a>	Did you know anything about this motivation to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2613"><a name="pos2613"></a>contaminate you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2615"><a name="pos2615"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  But is there a possibility that that is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2616"><a name="pos2616"></a>reason why you went on this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2617"><a name="pos2617"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2618"><a name="pos2618"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, I have no further places but </p>
<p class="line" id="line2619"><a name="pos2619"></a>Capt Mentz indicates he wants to say something about a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2620"><a name="pos2620"></a>specific page.  Could you please continue, Captain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2621"><a name="pos2621"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  Chairperson, on page 45, the second last </p>
<p class="line" id="line2622"><a name="pos2622"></a>paragraph.  Could I continue?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2623"><a name="pos2623"></a>		" It was the choice of the people who were </p>

<p class="line" id="line2626"><a name="pos2626"></a>Chairperson, I don't agree with that. You were never given a </p>

<p class="line" id="line2632"><a name="pos2632"></a>does it refer to the fact that he chooses you to go along on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2633"><a name="pos2633"></a>the operation and once you were involved you were actually </p>
<p class="line" id="line2634"><a name="pos2634"></a>caught up in the web and you were contaminated. Isn't that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2635"><a name="pos2635"></a>the choice that he is referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2636"><a name="pos2636"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  That's possible Chairperson, then maybe I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2637"><a name="pos2637"></a>misunderstood it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2638"><a name="pos2638"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Captain, any other aspects which you would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2639"><a name="pos2639"></a>like to comment on?  I am not going into detail on all of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2640"><a name="pos2640"></a>this. So please just page through and see whether there are </p>

<p class="line" id="line2642"><a name="pos2642"></a>	Captain Mentz, one last question.  Insofar - I am not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2643"><a name="pos2643"></a>going to refer you to each and every place here, but insofar </p>
<p class="line" id="line2644"><a name="pos2644"></a>as Warrant Officer Nortje's evidence differs from what you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2645"><a name="pos2645"></a>have testified, do you stand by what you have testified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2646"><a name="pos2646"></a>CAPT MENTZ:  I stand by what I have testified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2647"><a name="pos2647"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  I have no further questions in this regard. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2648"><a name="pos2648"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DU PLESSIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line2649"><a name="pos2649"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Mr Chairman, in respect of this matter we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2650"><a name="pos2650"></a>have also obtained affidavits from the other people who were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2651"><a name="pos2651"></a>involved in this specific matter of Ngqulunga.  Firstly, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2652"><a name="pos2652"></a>there is an affidavit by Col Baker and then there is also an </p>
<p class="line" id="line2653"><a name="pos2653"></a>affidavit by Col Bellingham or Capt Bellingham, I beg your </p>
<p class="line" id="line2654"><a name="pos2654"></a>pardon. I beg leave to hand up copies of these affidavits.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2655"><a name="pos2655"></a>The affidavit of Baker would then be EXHIBIT BB and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2656"><a name="pos2656"></a>affidavit of Bellingham EXHIBIT CC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2657"><a name="pos2657"></a>EXHIBITS BB AND CC HANDED IN</p>
<p class="line" id="line2658"><a name="pos2658"></a>	Mr Chairman, you will note that both these affidavits </p>
<p class="line" id="line2659"><a name="pos2659"></a>say that they have perused the written amnesty application </p>
<p class="line" id="line2660"><a name="pos2660"></a>of Capt Mentz, that they confirm the correctness of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2661"><a name="pos2661"></a>contents of the amnesty application of Capt Mentz, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2662"><a name="pos2662"></a>pertaining to the nature and particulars, the date, the </p>

<p class="line" id="line2664"><a name="pos2664"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	155	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line2665"><a name="pos2665"></a>place, the name of the victim, the political objectives and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2666"><a name="pos2666"></a>the particulars pertaining to the order given.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2667"><a name="pos2667"></a>	Then each of them say that,</p>
<p class="line" id="line2668"><a name="pos2668"></a>		"I wish to state that I will apply for amnesty for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2669"><a name="pos2669"></a>this act myself, and that my amnesty application </p>
<p class="line" id="line2670"><a name="pos2670"></a>will substantially contain the same evidence that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2671"><a name="pos2671"></a>was contained in Capt Wouter Mentz's application, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2672"><a name="pos2672"></a>as well as his testimony. I therefore support Capt </p>
<p class="line" id="line2673"><a name="pos2673"></a>Mentz's amnesty application. I am of the view that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2674"><a name="pos2674"></a>he has made full disclosure of all relevant facts </p>
<p class="line" id="line2675"><a name="pos2675"></a>pertaining to this incident".</p>
<p class="line" id="line2676"><a name="pos2676"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Does anything tie up this affidavit with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2677"><a name="pos2677"></a>incident that we are talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2678"><a name="pos2678"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, it doesn't appear from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2679"><a name="pos2679"></a>affidavits themselves, but I was involved specifically with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2680"><a name="pos2680"></a>drawing these affidavits, although I did not draw the final </p>
<p class="line" id="line2681"><a name="pos2681"></a>version.  That's why I see it now for the first time.  It </p>
<p class="line" id="line2682"><a name="pos2682"></a>does relate specifically to this fact.  Capt Mentz can also </p>
<p class="line" id="line2683"><a name="pos2683"></a>testify to that because he was present when this was done.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2684"><a name="pos2684"></a>So I can give you a confirmation that this, it relates to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2685"><a name="pos2685"></a>this specific incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2686"><a name="pos2686"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Have they been present when he gave evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2687"><a name="pos2687"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  No, Mr Chairman, they were not present when </p>
<p class="line" id="line2688"><a name="pos2688"></a>he gave evidence, but there was a tape-recording made which </p>
<p class="line" id="line2689"><a name="pos2689"></a>they listened to, of the evidence which Capt Mentz made </p>
<p class="line" id="line2690"><a name="pos2690"></a>himself, Mr Chairman. But Mr Chairman, I am presenting this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2691"><a name="pos2691"></a>affidavit mainly to confirm the correctness of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2692"><a name="pos2692"></a>application as it stands in the application papers.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2711"><a name="pos2711"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2712"><a name="pos2712"></a>ADV MPSHE:  The Chair and the Committee will recall that in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2713"><a name="pos2713"></a>Pretoria I was requested to obtain Annexure A to the post-</p>
<p class="line" id="line2714"><a name="pos2714"></a>mortem report of Brian Ngqulunga.  Mr Chairman, I did take </p>
<p class="line" id="line2715"><a name="pos2715"></a>some means of obtaining the Annexure A.  I went to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2716"><a name="pos2716"></a>Garankua police station on the 4th of March 1997 and I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2717"><a name="pos2717"></a>referred to a Constable Chelo Lusaba who is dealing with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2718"><a name="pos2718"></a>this type of matters.  She together with another policeman </p>
<p class="line" id="line2719"><a name="pos2719"></a>entered the store room and they looked for the docket, which </p>
<p class="line" id="line2720"><a name="pos2720"></a>they could not find.  Unfortunately I said to her that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2721"><a name="pos2721"></a>need a statement from her that the docket got lost in their </p>
<p class="line" id="line2722"><a name="pos2722"></a>possession and she promised to fax it down to me, but she </p>
<p class="line" id="line2723"><a name="pos2723"></a>has not done so.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2724"><a name="pos2724"></a>	Mr Chairman, in the meantime, I got hold of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2725"><a name="pos2725"></a>contents of the envelope before you.  Now these are the </p>

<p class="line" id="line2751"><a name="pos2751"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Mr Du Plessis, do you have a copy of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2752"><a name="pos2752"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  I do have a copy, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2753"><a name="pos2753"></a>JUDGE MALL:  We haven't had time to read this and I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line2754"><a name="pos2754"></a>wondering whether we should take a short adjournment, to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2755"><a name="pos2755"></a>enable you to read it as well, and to consider what you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2756"><a name="pos2756"></a>should do about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2757"><a name="pos2757"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, I have only received it now, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2758"><a name="pos2758"></a>Chairman. I would like to take it up with Brig Cronje and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2759"><a name="pos2759"></a>perhaps convey to the Committee just his view on this and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2760"><a name="pos2760"></a>his reaction on this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2761"><a name="pos2761"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2763"><a name="pos2763"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	158	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line2764"><a name="pos2764"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  I cannot recall his evidence in any event </p>
<p class="line" id="line2765"><a name="pos2765"></a>as having been to the effect that he factually knows or knew </p>
<p class="line" id="line2766"><a name="pos2766"></a>that Minister Pik Botha knew about it.  I will take it up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2767"><a name="pos2767"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes, whether the Press may have reported it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2768"><a name="pos2768"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, it may have been reported differently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2769"><a name="pos2769"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes, very well. Before we take this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2770"><a name="pos2770"></a>adjournment, apart from that, is there any other matter that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2771"><a name="pos2771"></a>has to be dealt with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2772"><a name="pos2772"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, at this point in time, in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2773"><a name="pos2773"></a>respect of evidence, there are no other matters.  In respect </p>
<p class="line" id="line2774"><a name="pos2774"></a>of the matter of Brig Cronje relating to the Swapo incident, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2775"><a name="pos2775"></a>we have decided to withdraw that matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2776"><a name="pos2776"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Alright, just let me get that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2777"><a name="pos2777"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  With reservation of all our rights, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2778"><a name="pos2778"></a>Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2779"><a name="pos2779"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Which number is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2780"><a name="pos2780"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, that is page 39 of Brig </p>
<p class="line" id="line2781"><a name="pos2781"></a>Cronjes application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2782"><a name="pos2782"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Schedule 2?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2783"><a name="pos2783"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Schedule as, as it pleases you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2784"><a name="pos2784"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  What do you exactly mean, withdraw with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2785"><a name="pos2785"></a>reservation of all your rights?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2786"><a name="pos2786"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, what I mean and I intended to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2787"><a name="pos2787"></a>explain that now, is that we wish to consider our position </p>
<p class="line" id="line2788"><a name="pos2788"></a>regarding this application.  The cut-off date for the final </p>
<p class="line" id="line2789"><a name="pos2789"></a>applications is in May and we want a little bit more time to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2790"><a name="pos2790"></a>consider our position in this regard.  If we make a decision </p>
<p class="line" id="line2791"><a name="pos2791"></a>to launch an application in regard to this matter again, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2792"><a name="pos2792"></a>will do so.  But at this point in time we have decided not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2793"><a name="pos2793"></a>to go ahead at this point in time with that application, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2794"><a name="pos2794"></a>Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2795"><a name="pos2795"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2796"><a name="pos2796"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	159	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line2797"><a name="pos2797"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  So are you just asking to have it removed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2798"><a name="pos2798"></a>from our roll?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2799"><a name="pos2799"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2800"><a name="pos2800"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Or are you in fact withdrawing the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2801"><a name="pos2801"></a>application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2802"><a name="pos2802"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  No, the effect is that I am asking for it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2803"><a name="pos2803"></a>to be removed.  What we will do is to, if we decide to go </p>
<p class="line" id="line2804"><a name="pos2804"></a>ahead with the application, we will lodge a formal </p>
<p class="line" id="line2805"><a name="pos2805"></a>application, again in the same fashion with the same </p>
<p class="line" id="line2806"><a name="pos2806"></a>contents, just to make hundred per cent sure that there is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2807"><a name="pos2807"></a>no problem.  We, however, want some time to consider that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2808"><a name="pos2808"></a>application and to decide if we really want to go ahead with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2809"><a name="pos2809"></a>that application.  So I am asking the Committee to strike it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2810"><a name="pos2810"></a>from the roll of the hearings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2811"><a name="pos2811"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes, very well.  You are granted leave to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2812"><a name="pos2812"></a>remove this matter from the roll.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2813"><a name="pos2813"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.   Mr Chairman, then </p>
<p class="line" id="line2814"><a name="pos2814"></a>the only matter that - actually two matters that are left, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2815"><a name="pos2815"></a>would be the record of the Harms Commission proceedings </p>
<p class="line" id="line2816"><a name="pos2816"></a>which we will obtain this evening, and then Prof Robertse's </p>
<p class="line" id="line2817"><a name="pos2817"></a>report.  Now as I have pointed out to you in chambers, and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2818"><a name="pos2818"></a>can say that now here as well, I have had to have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2819"><a name="pos2819"></a>discussions with some of my clients, the applicants, about </p>
<p class="line" id="line2820"><a name="pos2820"></a>the question of the publication of the contents of that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2821"><a name="pos2821"></a>report. I also had to convey that problem to Dr Robertse and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2822"><a name="pos2822"></a>I am trying to reconcile everybody concerned in this matter </p>
<p class="line" id="line2823"><a name="pos2823"></a>so that these reports can be made available to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2824"><a name="pos2824"></a>Committee, as public documents.  I am in the process of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2825"><a name="pos2825"></a>nearly finalising that and it will be finalised hopefully </p>
<p class="line" id="line2826"><a name="pos2826"></a>later this afternoon. I cannot give you an indication </p>
<p class="line" id="line2827"><a name="pos2827"></a>hundred per cent when.  Dr Robertse, I spoke to him this </p>

<p class="line" id="line2829"><a name="pos2829"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	160	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line2830"><a name="pos2830"></a>morning, before the hearing started and he gave me an </p>
<p class="line" id="line2831"><a name="pos2831"></a>indication that he would be able to finalise it throughout </p>
<p class="line" id="line2832"><a name="pos2832"></a>the morning, but that he would - and he discussed it with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2833"><a name="pos2833"></a>me, that he would have, would like to have one final short </p>
<p class="line" id="line2834"><a name="pos2834"></a>discussion with Capt Hechter, and that is the position I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2835"><a name="pos2835"></a>find myself in, Mr Chairman.  I have done my utmost to have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2836"><a name="pos2836"></a>it ready. I promised Monday, but there have been problems </p>
<p class="line" id="line2837"><a name="pos2837"></a>with this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2838"><a name="pos2838"></a>....Page 156, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2839"><a name="pos2839"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Page 39?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2840"><a name="pos2840"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  No, that was in respect of the Swapo </p>
<p class="line" id="line2841"><a name="pos2841"></a>incident.  Are you asking me about the Swapo incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2842"><a name="pos2842"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2843"><a name="pos2843"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  That is at page 39.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2844"><a name="pos2844"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2845"><a name="pos2845"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, I beg your pardon.  I thought you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2846"><a name="pos2846"></a>referred to the Gaberone bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2847"><a name="pos2847"></a>JUDGE MALL:  We will adjourn at this stage to enable you to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2848"><a name="pos2848"></a>consider this memorandum and for us to read it as well, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2849"><a name="pos2849"></a>we will resume at two o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2850"><a name="pos2850"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2851"><a name="pos2851"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Mr Mpshe, you asked no questions about the </p>

<p class="line" id="line2853"><a name="pos2853"></a>interim you feel that you might want to consider the matter </p>
<p class="line" id="line2854"><a name="pos2854"></a>and put questions, you will be allowed to do so.  Alright, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2855"><a name="pos2855"></a>we will adjourn now and resume at two o'clock.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2859"><a name="pos2859"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2860"><a name="pos2860"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Mr du Plessis, the memorandum which has been </p>
<p class="line" id="line2861"><a name="pos2861"></a>handed to me, is addressed to the Amnesty Committee and it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2862"><a name="pos2862"></a>bears the date 12th of March 1997.  In it Mr Botha records </p>
<p class="line" id="line2863"><a name="pos2863"></a>the following, or rather what Mr Botha said was recorded as </p>
<p class="line" id="line2864"><a name="pos2864"></a>follows:  That he objects most strongly to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2865"><a name="pos2865"></a>unsubstantiated comments made by Mr Nortje yesterday before </p>
<p class="line" id="line2866"><a name="pos2866"></a>the CommittEe which apparently were not challenged by any </p>
<p class="line" id="line2867"><a name="pos2867"></a>members of the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2868"><a name="pos2868"></a>		"According to Press reports today, Mr Cronje </p>
<p class="line" id="line2869"><a name="pos2869"></a>alleged that there was no doubt that I knew of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2870"><a name="pos2870"></a>security force plot to eliminate one of the master </p>
<p class="line" id="line2871"><a name="pos2871"></a>minds of the 1983 Church Street bomb blasts in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2872"><a name="pos2872"></a>Pretoria.  According to the Press reports, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2873"><a name="pos2873"></a>Cronje alleged that I publicly claimed that a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2874"><a name="pos2874"></a>certain MacKenzie was an ANC member and that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2875"><a name="pos2875"></a>had blown up his own vehicle.  Mr Cronje then </p>
<p class="line" id="line2876"><a name="pos2876"></a>stated that there was no doubt in his mind that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2877"><a name="pos2877"></a>knew what the true situation was.  Mr Cronje did </p>
<p class="line" id="line2878"><a name="pos2878"></a>not indicate any source for this allegation.      </p>
<p class="line" id="line2879"><a name="pos2879"></a>The facts are that the Botswana  Government </p>
<p class="line" id="line2880"><a name="pos2880"></a>complained to the South African Government.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line2881"><a name="pos2881"></a>Department of Foreign Affairs, as is the normal </p>
<p class="line" id="line2882"><a name="pos2882"></a>practice, sent the Botswana Government's comment </p>
<p class="line" id="line2883"><a name="pos2883"></a>to the South African Security Forces.  The South </p>
<p class="line" id="line2884"><a name="pos2884"></a>African Police responded that they had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2885"><a name="pos2885"></a>incontrovertible evidence that MacKenzie was being </p>
<p class="line" id="line2886"><a name="pos2886"></a>used by the ANC to transport weapons into South </p>
<p class="line" id="line2887"><a name="pos2887"></a>Africa from Botswana.  The SAP also said that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2888"><a name="pos2888"></a>had evidence that MacKenzie was in regular contact </p>
<p class="line" id="line2889"><a name="pos2889"></a>with certain members of the ANC in Zambia and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2890"><a name="pos2890"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2891"><a name="pos2891"></a>JUDGE MALL	162</p>
<p class="line" id="line2892"><a name="pos2892"></a>		Botswana. The SAP assured the Department of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2893"><a name="pos2893"></a>Foreign Affairs that the SAP was prepared to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2894"><a name="pos2894"></a>provide access to evidence which supported the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2895"><a name="pos2895"></a>facts which the SAP conveyed to the Department of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2896"><a name="pos2896"></a>Foreign Affairs.  The `incontrovertible evidence' </p>
<p class="line" id="line2897"><a name="pos2897"></a>of the SAP was forwarded to the Botswana </p>
<p class="line" id="line2898"><a name="pos2898"></a>Government in June 1987 in a formal note which was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2899"><a name="pos2899"></a>released to the Press.  It is obvious that Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2900"><a name="pos2900"></a>Cronje and his colleagues have supplied false </p>
<p class="line" id="line2901"><a name="pos2901"></a>information to the Department of Foreign Affairs. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2902"><a name="pos2902"></a> It is also obvious that after Mr De Klerk's </p>
<p class="line" id="line2903"><a name="pos2903"></a>evidence that the Cabinet was often deceived by </p>
<p class="line" id="line2904"><a name="pos2904"></a>certain members of the SAP dealing with these </p>
<p class="line" id="line2905"><a name="pos2905"></a>matters. I consider Mr Cronje's unsubstantiated </p>
<p class="line" id="line2906"><a name="pos2906"></a>allegations as a disgraceful attempt to draw </p>
<p class="line" id="line2907"><a name="pos2907"></a>attention away from his irresponsible activities. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2908"><a name="pos2908"></a> I will be grateful if the Committee could ask Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2909"><a name="pos2909"></a>Cronje on what basis of fact he made these </p>
<p class="line" id="line2910"><a name="pos2910"></a>allegations.  Due to lack of time I have no other </p>
<p class="line" id="line2911"><a name="pos2911"></a>means, but to convey the statement telephonically </p>
<p class="line" id="line2912"><a name="pos2912"></a>to the Committee."</p>
<p class="line" id="line2913"><a name="pos2913"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, I firstly just want to place </p>
<p class="line" id="line2914"><a name="pos2914"></a>on record, according to Mr Mpshe, the reference to Mr De </p>
<p class="line" id="line2915"><a name="pos2915"></a>Klerk should be De Kock. I presume that's Eugene de Kock in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2916"><a name="pos2916"></a>his evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2917"><a name="pos2917"></a>JUDGE MALL:  You are right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2918"><a name="pos2918"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  And that should be rectified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2919"><a name="pos2919"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2920"><a name="pos2920"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Now Mr Chairman, may I respond to this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2921"><a name="pos2921"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2922"><a name="pos2922"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Why do you say  De Kock, Mr Du Plessis?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2924"><a name="pos2924"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	163	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line2925"><a name="pos2925"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  I don't know, Mr Chairman, I was asked by </p>
<p class="line" id="line2926"><a name="pos2926"></a>Mr Mpshe.  Perhaps he should address you on this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2927"><a name="pos2927"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Mr Chairman, I was informed last by the person </p>
<p class="line" id="line2928"><a name="pos2928"></a>who took the message, Mr John Allen, who spoke with Mr Botha </p>
<p class="line" id="line2929"><a name="pos2929"></a>this morning.  He says he has made a mistake, he didn't say </p>
<p class="line" id="line2930"><a name="pos2930"></a>De Klerk but De Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2931"><a name="pos2931"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2932"><a name="pos2932"></a>ADV MPSHE:  He conveyed this to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2933"><a name="pos2933"></a>JUDGE MALL:  After Mr De Kock's evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2934"><a name="pos2934"></a>ADV MPSHE:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2935"><a name="pos2935"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Well, on the assumption that this ought to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2936"><a name="pos2936"></a>reflect Mr De Kock rather than Mr De Klerk, can we proceed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2937"><a name="pos2937"></a>further with this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2938"><a name="pos2938"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, I can respond to this, and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2939"><a name="pos2939"></a>would like Brig Cronje to tell you exactly on what he based </p>
<p class="line" id="line2940"><a name="pos2940"></a>his allegation, and I will call him as a witness in that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2941"><a name="pos2941"></a>regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2942"><a name="pos2942"></a>	I firstly want to state that from Brig Cronjes point of</p>
<p class="line" id="line2943"><a name="pos2943"></a>view I was asked to place on record, in respect of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2944"><a name="pos2944"></a>second last sentence, where Minister Botha said that it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2945"><a name="pos2945"></a>obvious that Mr Cronje and his colleagues have supplied </p>

<p class="line" id="line2982"><a name="pos2982"></a> To my mind, to inform means that you tell him the truth.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2983"><a name="pos2983"></a>You do not want the true facts in order to inform him </p>

<p class="line" id="line3010"><a name="pos3010"></a>Brig Loots'.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3036"><a name="pos3036"></a>the Press, he now sees in the Press, he says Mr Cronje, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3037"><a name="pos3037"></a>"an allegation was made that a certain MacKenzie was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3038"><a name="pos3038"></a>member of the ANC, was an ANC member and that he had blown </p>

<p class="line" id="line3040"><a name="pos3040"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  That is what was in the paper,  in today's </p>
<p class="line" id="line3041"><a name="pos3041"></a>newspaper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3042"><a name="pos3042"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  I am talking about the first article in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3043"><a name="pos3043"></a>first paper right after the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3044"><a name="pos3044"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  I can't understand this memo.  The way I read </p>
<p class="line" id="line3045"><a name="pos3045"></a>it according to Press reports today, Mr Cronje alleged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3046"><a name="pos3046"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Yes, then I agree with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3047"><a name="pos3047"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  So it was the recent Press reports after you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3048"><a name="pos3048"></a>have given evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3049"><a name="pos3049"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3050"><a name="pos3050"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  You must please help me now because I do not </p>
<p class="line" id="line3051"><a name="pos3051"></a>remember, I do not recall you saying that MacKenzie had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line3052"><a name="pos3052"></a>an ANC member who blew up his own vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3053"><a name="pos3053"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Yes, I never said that. I said that MacKenzie </p>
<p class="line" id="line3054"><a name="pos3054"></a>had been an informant and that his vehicle had been blown up </p>

<p class="line" id="line3058"><a name="pos3058"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Therefore this quotation Mr Botha here </p>
<p class="line" id="line3059"><a name="pos3059"></a>quotes, was read somewhere in a paper that gave the facts of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3060"><a name="pos3060"></a>your evidence wrongly. And in the second paragraph, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line3061"><a name="pos3061"></a>discusses what he then did.  And there he nowhere says that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3062"><a name="pos3062"></a>anybody told him that MacKenzie had blown up his own </p>
<p class="line" id="line3063"><a name="pos3063"></a>vehicle.  BRIG CRONJE:  That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3064"><a name="pos3064"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  He only says there that MacKenzie had been an </p>
<p class="line" id="line3065"><a name="pos3065"></a>ANC agent who brought weapons to South Africa.   Was that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3066"><a name="pos3066"></a>not in accordance what you informed them at that stage, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3067"><a name="pos3067"></a>MacKenzie had transported weapons in the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3068"><a name="pos3068"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Yes, that was what happened and what was in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3069"><a name="pos3069"></a>the papers at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3070"><a name="pos3070"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  The vehicle had been registered in </p>

<p class="line" id="line3072"><a name="pos3072"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I said that the number plates of the vehicle </p>
<p class="line" id="line3073"><a name="pos3073"></a>were registered in MacKenzie's name.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3074"><a name="pos3074"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  But it was not said in this report that </p>

<p class="line" id="line3076"><a name="pos3076"></a>own vehicle.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3144"><a name="pos3144"></a>Currin and it would be available early tomorrow morning.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line3145"><a name="pos3145"></a>can deal with it at eight o'clock or earlier. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3146"><a name="pos3146"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Mr Du Plessis, if I turn up here at six </p>
<p class="line" id="line3147"><a name="pos3147"></a>o'clock tomorrow and you haven't got that report here and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3148"><a name="pos3148"></a>you ask for the matter to stand down ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3149"><a name="pos3149"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  I won't Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3150"><a name="pos3150"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Very well, Gentlemen, the Committee will </p>
<p class="line" id="line3151"><a name="pos3151"></a>adjourn until nine o'clock tomorrow morning, in the hope </p>
<p class="line" id="line3152"><a name="pos3152"></a>that we will finalise this as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3153"><a name="pos3153"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, I will give you my undertaking </p>
<p class="line" id="line3154"><a name="pos3154"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3155"><a name="pos3155"></a>170</p>
<p class="line" id="line3156"><a name="pos3156"></a>that tomorrow morning we will finalise it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3157"><a name="pos3157"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3158"><a name="pos3158"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line3159"><a name="pos3159"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line3160"><a name="pos3160"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes, Gentlemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3161"><a name="pos3161"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you, Mr Chairman. Mr Chairman, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line3162"><a name="pos3162"></a>have had an opportunity yesterday afternoon to visit Prof </p>
<p class="line" id="line3163"><a name="pos3163"></a>Robertse in Stellenbosch.  He did have another consultation </p>
<p class="line" id="line3164"><a name="pos3164"></a>with Capt Hechter and we were able to sort out any problems </p>
<p class="line" id="line3165"><a name="pos3165"></a>- all the problems regarding the report.  It is possible for </p>
<p class="line" id="line3166"><a name="pos3166"></a>me to hand in a report in respect of each of the five </p>
<p class="line" id="line3167"><a name="pos3167"></a>applicants.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3168"><a name="pos3168"></a>	The report is accompanied by Prof Robertse's curriculum </p>
<p class="line" id="line3169"><a name="pos3169"></a>vitae, as well as a letter in which he explains the fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line3170"><a name="pos3170"></a>that he had to consult again with Capt Hechter, and that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line3171"><a name="pos3171"></a>could not do that in Cape Town yesterday.  I requested him </p>
<p class="line" id="line3172"><a name="pos3172"></a>yesterday afternoon when we adjourned, if he could come to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3173"><a name="pos3173"></a>Cape Town so that we could finalise it here and it might </p>
<p class="line" id="line3174"><a name="pos3174"></a>have been possible to deal with this perhaps late yesterday </p>
<p class="line" id="line3175"><a name="pos3175"></a>afternoon, but it wasn't possible.	I beg leave to hand up </p>
<p class="line" id="line3176"><a name="pos3176"></a>copies of the report to you.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3177"><a name="pos3177"></a>	Mr Chairman, I don't intend to deal with the contents </p>
<p class="line" id="line3178"><a name="pos3178"></a>of the report at this point in time.  I believe that would </p>
<p class="line" id="line3179"><a name="pos3179"></a>be ANNEXURE FF, if my memory serves me correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3180"><a name="pos3180"></a>	Mr Chairman, the report is an extensive report. If I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3181"><a name="pos3181"></a>can just give you a little bit of background about the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3182"><a name="pos3182"></a>report. It is an extensive report, dealing with firstly, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3183"><a name="pos3183"></a>post-traumatic stress, with specific emphasis on memory </p>
<p class="line" id="line3184"><a name="pos3184"></a>loss, but not only that, as a general background. Then it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3185"><a name="pos3185"></a>gives an evaluation of each of the applicants.  It discusses </p>
<p class="line" id="line3186"><a name="pos3186"></a>the problems that they currently have, as a result of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3187"><a name="pos3187"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3188"><a name="pos3188"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	171	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line3189"><a name="pos3189"></a>actions they were involved in, and it specifically then also </p>
<p class="line" id="line3190"><a name="pos3190"></a>deals with the question of memory loss.  It does not only </p>
<p class="line" id="line3191"><a name="pos3191"></a>deal with that question.  It deals with a further variety of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3192"><a name="pos3192"></a>issues which we deem important for purposes of argument in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3193"><a name="pos3193"></a>this regard.  Specifically with reference to the general </p>
<p class="line" id="line3194"><a name="pos3194"></a>background in respect of which the applicants operated.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3195"><a name="pos3195"></a>will refer to the report in my argument, unless you want me </p>
<p class="line" id="line3196"><a name="pos3196"></a>to address you on something specific out of the report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3197"><a name="pos3197"></a>JUDGE MALL:  I understood yesterday that you were going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3198"><a name="pos3198"></a>find out from Mr Currin whether he has any views on this </p>
<p class="line" id="line3199"><a name="pos3199"></a>matter.  Has that been done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3200"><a name="pos3200"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairman, obviously because of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3201"><a name="pos3201"></a>logistical problem, we had a problem.  My attorney, Mr Britz </p>
<p class="line" id="line3202"><a name="pos3202"></a>did speak to Mr Currin. He said - to his personnel.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line3203"><a name="pos3203"></a>couldn't get hold of him personally.  They indicated that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3204"><a name="pos3204"></a>there wasn't a problem, that the report could go in, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line3205"><a name="pos3205"></a>they said that we should place on record that they reserve </p>
<p class="line" id="line3206"><a name="pos3206"></a>all their rights pertaining to this report and that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3207"><a name="pos3207"></a>will let the Committee have their view on this in due </p>
<p class="line" id="line3208"><a name="pos3208"></a>course.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3209"><a name="pos3209"></a>	I may mention that I had a discussion with Mr Currin </p>
<p class="line" id="line3210"><a name="pos3210"></a>before, last week, about this report and the possibility </p>
<p class="line" id="line3211"><a name="pos3211"></a>that oral evidence would be required.  He gave me an </p>
<p class="line" id="line3212"><a name="pos3212"></a>indication that he does not think that that would be </p>
<p class="line" id="line3213"><a name="pos3213"></a>necessary and only if the circumstances really warrant it, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3214"><a name="pos3214"></a>he would ask for such an opportunity.  We obviously, if he </p>
<p class="line" id="line3215"><a name="pos3215"></a>wants to do that, we obviously will have discussions with </p>
<p class="line" id="line3216"><a name="pos3216"></a>him, see if we can't sort whatever he wants to deal with, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3217"><a name="pos3217"></a>sort that out between ourselves, so that we perhaps could </p>
<p class="line" id="line3218"><a name="pos3218"></a>present the Committee then with a joint separate report or a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3219"><a name="pos3219"></a>memorandum, pertaining to his problems and the answers </p>
<p class="line" id="line3220"><a name="pos3220"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3221"><a name="pos3221"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	172	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line3222"><a name="pos3222"></a>thereto.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3223"><a name="pos3223"></a>	What I foresee, Mr Chairman, is that if he has certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line3224"><a name="pos3224"></a>questions, they could perhaps be put by him to Dr Robertse </p>
<p class="line" id="line3225"><a name="pos3225"></a>telephonically.  It could be taped and it could be </p>
<p class="line" id="line3226"><a name="pos3226"></a>transcribed or it could be dealt with in any other way that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3227"><a name="pos3227"></a>would make the Committee's task much easier, instead of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3228"><a name="pos3228"></a>calling him as a witness.  Obviously if the members of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3229"><a name="pos3229"></a>Committee wish to ask Dr Robertse questions the same </p>
<p class="line" id="line3230"><a name="pos3230"></a>procedure can be followed or he can be called to give </p>
<p class="line" id="line3231"><a name="pos3231"></a>evidence.  He is prepared to give evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3232"><a name="pos3232"></a>	I don't know if there are any further aspects </p>
<p class="line" id="line3233"><a name="pos3233"></a>pertaining to this, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3234"><a name="pos3234"></a>JUDGE MALL:  The way I understand it, a copy of this </p>
<p class="line" id="line3235"><a name="pos3235"></a>particular document has not yet reached Mr Currin. Is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3236"><a name="pos3236"></a>it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3237"><a name="pos3237"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  It hasn't, Mr Chairman.   We will, we are </p>
<p class="line" id="line3238"><a name="pos3238"></a>going to try to do that today.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3239"><a name="pos3239"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3240"><a name="pos3240"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  We will let him have that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3241"><a name="pos3241"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Well, on the understanding that you have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3242"><a name="pos3242"></a>conveyed to us that you will endeavour to discuss this </p>
<p class="line" id="line3243"><a name="pos3243"></a>matter with Mr Currin, it may be that after you have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3244"><a name="pos3244"></a>discussed it, you will submit jointly a memorandum.  If it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3245"><a name="pos3245"></a>transpires that Mr Currin requires the witness to be called </p>
<p class="line" id="line3246"><a name="pos3246"></a>to give evidence or for himself to call a consultant to give </p>
<p class="line" id="line3247"><a name="pos3247"></a>evidence, we will deal with that matter when that problem </p>
<p class="line" id="line3248"><a name="pos3248"></a>arises.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3249"><a name="pos3249"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, that is my suggestion, Mr Chairman.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3250"><a name="pos3250"></a>don't want to belabour the Committee with that, I think Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3251"><a name="pos3251"></a>Currin and ourselves can deal with that very easily, as we </p>
<p class="line" id="line3252"><a name="pos3252"></a>have dealt with other issues during these hearings, and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3253"><a name="pos3253"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3254"><a name="pos3254"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	173	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line3255"><a name="pos3255"></a>think we can come to a very satisfactory conclusion without </p>
<p class="line" id="line3256"><a name="pos3256"></a>a problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3257"><a name="pos3257"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Could I also add that I would suggest if that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3258"><a name="pos3258"></a>does arise, arrangements should be made to hear the witness </p>
<p class="line" id="line3259"><a name="pos3259"></a>elsewhere and not - we don't all have to come down to Cape </p>
<p class="line" id="line3260"><a name="pos3260"></a>Town for that purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3261"><a name="pos3261"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, obviously an arrangement can be made </p>
<p class="line" id="line3262"><a name="pos3262"></a>which suits the members of the Commission the best and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line3263"><a name="pos3263"></a>will make arrangements to be available in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3264"><a name="pos3264"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Mr Mpshe, have you any comments to make in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line3265"><a name="pos3265"></a>regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3266"><a name="pos3266"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Mr Chairman, thank you, I don't have any </p>
<p class="line" id="line3267"><a name="pos3267"></a>comment, but just to confirm what my learned friend has told </p>
<p class="line" id="line3268"><a name="pos3268"></a>the Committee about Mr Brian Currin.  I also had a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3269"><a name="pos3269"></a>discussion with him telephonically yesterday and he stated </p>
<p class="line" id="line3270"><a name="pos3270"></a>to me exactly what my learned friend has just conveyed to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3271"><a name="pos3271"></a>the Committee.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3272"><a name="pos3272"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Thank you.  Thank you very much. This document, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3273"><a name="pos3273"></a>including the letter from Dr Robertse and all the annexures </p>
<p class="line" id="line3274"><a name="pos3274"></a>thereto, will figure as EXHIBIT FF, in these proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3275"><a name="pos3275"></a>EXHIBIT FF HANDED IN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3276"><a name="pos3276"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, then </p>
<p class="line" id="line3277"><a name="pos3277"></a>there is only one issue left, and that is, we gave the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3278"><a name="pos3278"></a>Committee an undertaking that in respect of the matter of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3279"><a name="pos3279"></a>Brian Ngqulunga, we would endeavour also to obtain the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3280"><a name="pos3280"></a>record of the evidence that he gave at the Harms Commission. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3281"><a name="pos3281"></a> We have been able to obtain that, Mr Chairman.  I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line3282"><a name="pos3282"></a>have the usual confirmation that it is a correct transcript, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3283"><a name="pos3283"></a>et cetera.  This - one of our other clients, one of Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3284"><a name="pos3284"></a>Britz' other clients obtained this for us.  I don't have any </p>
<p class="line" id="line3285"><a name="pos3285"></a>reason to believe that it is not correct, but I don't have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3286"><a name="pos3286"></a>the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3287"><a name="pos3287"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3288"><a name="pos3288"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	174	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line3289"><a name="pos3289"></a>normal confirmation thereof.  But I, however, do have copies </p>
<p class="line" id="line3290"><a name="pos3290"></a>for the Committee which I beg leave to hand up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3291"><a name="pos3291"></a>	Mr Chairman, I don't intend to deal with that record at </p>
<p class="line" id="line3292"><a name="pos3292"></a>all in evidence by Capt Mentz at all, and I will only use it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3293"><a name="pos3293"></a>in argument, for argument purposes. Mr Chairman, that would </p>
<p class="line" id="line3294"><a name="pos3294"></a>be Exhibit GG.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3295"><a name="pos3295"></a>JUDGE MALL:  This transcript of the evidence given by Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3296"><a name="pos3296"></a>Brian Ngqulunga before the Harms Commission will be received </p>
<p class="line" id="line3297"><a name="pos3297"></a>by the Committee as EXHIBIT GG.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3299"><a name="pos3299"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3300"><a name="pos3300"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Is there any other matter, Mr Mpshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3301"><a name="pos3301"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I don't know whether to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3302"><a name="pos3302"></a>raise that here, Mr Chairman, but it pertains to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3303"><a name="pos3303"></a>discussion between the Chair and members with the lady, Ms </p>
<p class="line" id="line3304"><a name="pos3304"></a>Pumla. I don't think it can be raised here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3305"><a name="pos3305"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3306"><a name="pos3306"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Then there is nothing </p>
<p class="line" id="line3307"><a name="pos3307"></a>more to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3308"><a name="pos3308"></a>JUDGE MALL:  You will make available a copy of the report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3309"><a name="pos3309"></a>ADV MPSHE:  I have made it available to her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3310"><a name="pos3310"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3311"><a name="pos3311"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, I'm sorry, there is just one </p>
<p class="line" id="line3312"><a name="pos3312"></a>issue that I would like to raise and that is the question of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3313"><a name="pos3313"></a>the heads of argument and the question of judgment.  It is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3314"><a name="pos3314"></a>something that we could discuss it with chambers with you or </p>
<p class="line" id="line3315"><a name="pos3315"></a>we could raise it here. I just want an indication from you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3316"><a name="pos3316"></a>JUDGE MALL:  We should talk about heads of argument, so that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3317"><a name="pos3317"></a>all of us have some idea as to when we would be able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3318"><a name="pos3318"></a>attend to this matter, in the absence of calling any further </p>
<p class="line" id="line3319"><a name="pos3319"></a>evidence.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3320"><a name="pos3320"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3321"><a name="pos3321"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	175	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3322"><a name="pos3322"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairman, there are a few issues </p>
<p class="line" id="line3323"><a name="pos3323"></a>that have to be cleared up in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3324"><a name="pos3324"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.  Well, now are we not in a position to fix </p>
<p class="line" id="line3325"><a name="pos3325"></a>a time by which heads of argument is to come in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3326"><a name="pos3326"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, yes, that wouldn't be a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3327"><a name="pos3327"></a>problem.  I would need, I would say approximately three to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3328"><a name="pos3328"></a>four weeks inbetween, inbetween other matters that I have to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3329"><a name="pos3329"></a>deal with, to be able to finalise the heads of argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3330"><a name="pos3330"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Would you base your argument on the typed </p>
<p class="line" id="line3331"><a name="pos3331"></a>transcript to the evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3332"><a name="pos3332"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairman, and that would also cause </p>
<p class="line" id="line3333"><a name="pos3333"></a>a problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3334"><a name="pos3334"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Yes, our experience in the past, I think, to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3335"><a name="pos3335"></a>say three to four weeks might be a little ambitious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3336"><a name="pos3336"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, I am a bit apprehensive in committing </p>
<p class="line" id="line3337"><a name="pos3337"></a>myself to that.  That was obviously on the basis that I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3338"><a name="pos3338"></a>the record available on Monday, that I can start, which I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3339"><a name="pos3339"></a>don't think would be the case.   We have the record of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3340"><a name="pos3340"></a>first part of the hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3341"><a name="pos3341"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Mr Mpshe, have you any objection to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3342"><a name="pos3342"></a>arrangement that counsel be allowed four weeks within which </p>
<p class="line" id="line3343"><a name="pos3343"></a>to submit his heads of argument?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3344"><a name="pos3344"></a>ADV MPSHE:   Mr Chairman, I would have no problem with that, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3345"><a name="pos3345"></a>Mr Chairman, but I just want to indicate that the record is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3346"><a name="pos3346"></a>not yet available, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3347"><a name="pos3347"></a>JUDGE MALL:  I understand that, yes.  The heads of argument </p>
<p class="line" id="line3348"><a name="pos3348"></a>can be commenced with, in respect of that portion of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3349"><a name="pos3349"></a>hearing where the record is completed, so regular work can </p>
<p class="line" id="line3350"><a name="pos3350"></a>be done in the meanwhile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3351"><a name="pos3351"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, may I enquire from the Chair </p>
<p class="line" id="line3352"><a name="pos3352"></a>if it would be possible for me to approach the Committee </p>
<p class="line" id="line3353"><a name="pos3353"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3354"><a name="pos3354"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	176	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line3355"><a name="pos3355"></a>perhaps, or yourself, if there is a problem with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3356"><a name="pos3356"></a>availability of the last part of the record, and I see that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3357"><a name="pos3357"></a>there isn't enough time.  The reason why I am prepared to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3358"><a name="pos3358"></a>commit myself to a period soon after the hearings, is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3359"><a name="pos3359"></a>fact that we deem it important to have the heads of argument </p>
<p class="line" id="line3360"><a name="pos3360"></a>in and we want to deal with this while everything is fresh </p>
<p class="line" id="line3361"><a name="pos3361"></a>in our minds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3362"><a name="pos3362"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3363"><a name="pos3363"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  May I approach you then when a problem </p>
<p class="line" id="line3364"><a name="pos3364"></a>arises pertaining to the record, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3365"><a name="pos3365"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes, there is no hard and fast rule, but we </p>
<p class="line" id="line3366"><a name="pos3366"></a>were hoping that if we discussed the matter here publicly, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3367"><a name="pos3367"></a>it is clear to all interested parties, that this matter is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3368"><a name="pos3368"></a>not just going to drag on and on, you know, and the public </p>
<p class="line" id="line3369"><a name="pos3369"></a>knows nothing about when we are going to be turning our mind </p>
<p class="line" id="line3370"><a name="pos3370"></a>to this application. So I think it is important for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3371"><a name="pos3371"></a>public to know that the next step in these proceedings is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3372"><a name="pos3372"></a>going to be heads of argument, which at present are to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line3373"><a name="pos3373"></a>four weeks from now, and if there are difficulties in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3374"><a name="pos3374"></a>way of obtaining a transcript of the evidence, that is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3375"><a name="pos3375"></a>factor which the Committee will take into account.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3376"><a name="pos3376"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3377"><a name="pos3377"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3378"><a name="pos3378"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, if you will just bear with me </p>
<p class="line" id="line3379"><a name="pos3379"></a>for one moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3380"><a name="pos3380"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3381"><a name="pos3381"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, I beg your pardon.  Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3382"><a name="pos3382"></a>Chairman, there is one aspect which I want to raise with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3383"><a name="pos3383"></a>Committee and that is the question, if the heads of argument </p>
<p class="line" id="line3384"><a name="pos3384"></a>is presented to the Committee, can we accept that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3385"><a name="pos3385"></a>applications have been finalised and the applications will </p>
<p class="line" id="line3386"><a name="pos3386"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3387"><a name="pos3387"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	177	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line3388"><a name="pos3388"></a>then be adjudged on the basis of the evidence presented to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3389"><a name="pos3389"></a>the Committee coupled with the heads of argument?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3390"><a name="pos3390"></a>Obviously, if that is not the case, I would like an </p>
<p class="line" id="line3391"><a name="pos3391"></a>indication from the Committee exactly how possibly other </p>
<p class="line" id="line3392"><a name="pos3392"></a>amnesty applications might have an influence on that, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3393"><a name="pos3393"></a>because it might be important for me to present you with </p>
<p class="line" id="line3394"><a name="pos3394"></a>supplementary heads of argument, pertaining to other </p>
<p class="line" id="line3395"><a name="pos3395"></a>applications if the Committee is going to take the contents </p>
<p class="line" id="line3396"><a name="pos3396"></a>of other applications into account.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3397"><a name="pos3397"></a>JUDGE MALL:  I think you must assume that when the time </p>
<p class="line" id="line3398"><a name="pos3398"></a>comes for the Committee to consider this massive volume of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3399"><a name="pos3399"></a>evidence, and its far-reaching implications, that if at some </p>
<p class="line" id="line3400"><a name="pos3400"></a>stage in the near future, other applicants give evidence, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3401"><a name="pos3401"></a>whose evidence may impact on your client's case, your </p>
<p class="line" id="line3402"><a name="pos3402"></a>attention will be drawn to that.  You will be afforded an </p>
<p class="line" id="line3403"><a name="pos3403"></a>opportunity to react to it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3404"><a name="pos3404"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairman, I just want to clear this </p>
<p class="line" id="line3405"><a name="pos3405"></a>out that I would then have the right to present you with </p>
<p class="line" id="line3406"><a name="pos3406"></a>supplementary - if you haven't given judgment yet, to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3407"><a name="pos3407"></a>present you with supplementary heads of argument pertaining </p>
<p class="line" id="line3408"><a name="pos3408"></a>to that evidence in the other application that is going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3409"><a name="pos3409"></a>be led by somebody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3410"><a name="pos3410"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Well, the whole purpose of drawing it to your </p>
<p class="line" id="line3411"><a name="pos3411"></a>attention is to enable you to deal with the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3412"><a name="pos3412"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you, Mr Chairman, I just wanted to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3413"><a name="pos3413"></a>...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3414"><a name="pos3414"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  As I recollect, one of your clients yesterday </p>
<p class="line" id="line3415"><a name="pos3415"></a>asked us to have regard to the evidence of someone else who </p>
<p class="line" id="line3416"><a name="pos3416"></a>had made an application.  Could I add something to what the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3417"><a name="pos3417"></a>Chairman has said about notification.  It seems to me that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3418"><a name="pos3418"></a>it might well be in your interest if you are notified of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3419"><a name="pos3419"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3420"><a name="pos3420"></a>178</p>
<p class="line" id="line3421"><a name="pos3421"></a>hearings.  Rather than merely the evidence that was later - </p>
<p class="line" id="line3422"><a name="pos3422"></a>because obviously you would be - your clients should be </p>
<p class="line" id="line3423"><a name="pos3423"></a>interested parties at such hearings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3424"><a name="pos3424"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairman, we would appreciate that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3425"><a name="pos3425"></a>if the Commission could let us know of all hearings that are </p>
<p class="line" id="line3426"><a name="pos3426"></a>scheduled so that we can decide exactly where we have to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3427"><a name="pos3427"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Well, all hearings relating to incidents that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3428"><a name="pos3428"></a>your clients have been involved in or may be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3429"><a name="pos3429"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3430"><a name="pos3430"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  And clearly you don't want to be told about </p>
<p class="line" id="line3431"><a name="pos3431"></a>hearings that have nothing whatsoever to do with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3432"><a name="pos3432"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, but Mr Chairman, what I do foresee is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3433"><a name="pos3433"></a>that we also act for about 20 other applicants.  So I do </p>
<p class="line" id="line3434"><a name="pos3434"></a>foresee that we might be here in respect of other </p>
<p class="line" id="line3435"><a name="pos3435"></a>applications as well.  So we would like to have a schedule </p>
<p class="line" id="line3436"><a name="pos3436"></a>of all hearings that are scheduled so that we can decide.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3437"><a name="pos3437"></a>We will take it up with the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3438"><a name="pos3438"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.  Alright.  This brings to a conclusion the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3439"><a name="pos3439"></a>proceedings this morning, Mr Mpshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3440"><a name="pos3440"></a>ADV MPSHE:  That is so, Mr Chairman, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3441"><a name="pos3441"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.  Mr Mpshe, is the position that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3442"><a name="pos3442"></a>Committee's next public hearing is going to be in East </p>
<p class="line" id="line3443"><a name="pos3443"></a>London on Monday morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3444"><a name="pos3444"></a>ADV MPSHE:  That is so, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3445"><a name="pos3445"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Very well.  The Committee now adjourns and if </p>
<p class="line" id="line3446"><a name="pos3446"></a>there are any further developments that impact on this </p>
<p class="line" id="line3447"><a name="pos3447"></a>particular application, notice to all interested parties </p>
<p class="line" id="line3448"><a name="pos3448"></a>will be given.  You will make a copy of your heads of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3449"><a name="pos3449"></a>argument insofar as they are relevant to Mr Currin's client </p>
<p class="line" id="line3450"><a name="pos3450"></a>as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3451"><a name="pos3451"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, MR Chairman, I will make available a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3452"><a name="pos3452"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3453"><a name="pos3453"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	179	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line3454"><a name="pos3454"></a>copy of my heads of argument to Mr Currin, and I will also </p>
<p class="line" id="line3455"><a name="pos3455"></a>endeavour to make it available to Mr Visser, if he should be </p>
<p class="line" id="line3456"><a name="pos3456"></a>interested and Mrs Kruger and anybody else who appeared </p>
<p class="line" id="line3457"><a name="pos3457"></a>during the hearings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3458"><a name="pos3458"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  The Committee </p>
<p class="line" id="line3459"><a name="pos3459"></a>adjourns.</p>
