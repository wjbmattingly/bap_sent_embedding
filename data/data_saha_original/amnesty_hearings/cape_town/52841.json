Then the second shot, I was shot through my left chest, I could feel a whole there, directly on my heart.\n\tThen I, I am a left hand shooter and my weapon I was carrying on my left hand side, and I could not get hold of my weapon because my arm was lamed, totally lamed.  \n\tThat must have been of the shooting.  Now, then I saw this man was going to shoot again, he was very near to me.  I think most probably it couldn't be more than 20 metres or 30 metres.  Approximately 30 metres.\n\tI could see his face, I could recognise he had on a shirt with short sleeves, there was brownish in it, and his pants were I think, it could have been also brownish.  He was to me a bit short.  His face looked as the one accused I have seen here.\n\tThe light was a bit dim, it was not totally light, so it was not so easy to recognise it fully.  What I wanted to say is that then when the third shots came, I saw then that he would strike me, because he was very near, and I could do nothing, I could just call upon my Lord to help me.  I called Jesus' name.  I believe in him like many other people also believe.  I could just call He must help me.\n\tThat I could feel the shots as they were passing me, here by my feet and here by the seat where I was sitting, leaned and so, and so it struck everywhere around me, but no shots - I was not shot anywhere.  I was lucky not to be shot.\n\tThen I decided I must start the van again and then I started the van again and it took on.  As I was pulling away, I think it was in a southern direction, that is in the direction of the old SAP Crossroads, then I could hear again somebody firing, but then it felt to me as if he was firing from in front of me.\n\tThose bullets didn't strike the van totally, it missed so that the most of the bullets just struck the sails, the canvass at the back of the van.  Then I contacted with the radio our Radio Control and gave them the situation where I was, what I was in.  I made it to the police station, where I handed over my gun and reported the case.\n\tThe Squad Control were very quick on the scene, and they took me to Conradie Hospital where I was stabilised.  On the way my lungs fell flat, I had a lot of pain, I was bleeding a lot.   When I came to Conradie Hospital, they put a tube straight in the wound where the bullet went in to get all the blood out.  Then my lungs started functioning again.\n\tAll I can say shortly is that they have established that the wound didn't damage any bones.  The shooting wound didn't damage any nerves.  It made the outward, where the bullet went out, it made a hole of 12 x 8 cm.   The (indistinct) muscles had been destroyed totally, it was a big hole.\n\tWhere the bullet went in, there was a small hole.",

That is why I couldn't lift up my arm.  Now, as a cause of that I had a lot of pain, I lost a lot of blood.  I didn't believe in taking blood, it is against my Christian principle.  I refused to take blood.\n\tI thank the Lord for the medical people, for what they did for me, but I believed I had this thing, that I feel I shouldn't be taking the blood, because I saw a TV programme the week before that they said that the blood is not so very safe.  I refused to take the blood.\n\tThen I was transferred to Panorama Hospital and there I had been treated for three weeks I think.  Then they performed a skin transplant over this opening of the hole at the rear of my back, which they said is 12 x 8 cm. \n\tThen I had been taken to my home where my sister has helped me further to nurse myself.

It was very difficult for them at that stage, to get my arm right.  I went through a lot of pain.  This whole shooting I went through a lot of pain.  That is nothing against the fact of the spiritual pain I had.\n\tWhen I was in the Panorama Hospital, after three days I think, then one day something strange happened to me.  Suddenly my chest, I couldn't breathe and my throat just pulled together to such an extent that I couldn't talk.  I didn't have any voice.  I was in such a state that I felt I could die.\n\tI couldn't talk.  That was a shock, they said it is the shock of the shooting, because when I was waiting to be killed.  I was waiting for them to kill me, I couldn't defend myself.  That made a big shock on my body, but after a few hours, I regained my voice.\n\tI had some psychological treatment as part of that.  And then I have had sleep trouble, insomnia.  I also had to get medical treatment for that.  I couldn't sleep because in the night I got nightmares and people were shooting at me.\n\tUp to this stage, I am battling to sleep regularly.  I have got sleeping problems.  On the other hand, my health is good.  The arm doesn't hinder me, not much.  I train with weight and it doesn't effect me.

Can I just say that except that the evidence that we heard this morning from Mr Meyer and Mr Mtumzeli, except that that really does, with respect, assist the Commission greatly in filling in the picture as it were, about the two incidents in question, they don't effect the written submissions at all.\n\tIn fact, I want to suggest that it supports the disclosure, albeit limited from their point of view, that the applicants have made.  What struck me especially from this morning's evidence, is and I am sure the Committee must have picked this up also in other applications, is the almost total disregard for the plight of black people, including black policemen and officials like Security Guards, when it came to summonsing the assistance of the official Police to come to their assistance.\n\tThey seem to have taken forever to arrive on the scene of various incidents, especially those incidents that took place in the townships.

            "Thank you Mr Chairperson.  In the heads, we say that the applicants apply for amnesty in respect of five, only four had been mentioned specifically in your bundle.  The one that had been added was in fact the one so graphically described by Mr Meyer, which is the Guguletu attack at NY 108.  It is I have pointed out yesterday, at page 32, it is mentioned by one of the applicants.\n\tThe points we would like to highlight, if I could just refer to page 8, the Claremont restaurant attack in which my colleague, Mr Warner has an interest.  This concerns only applicant Shiceka and we submit that this attack is very similar to the one perpetrated on the Crazy Beat Disco at Newcastle, the Heidelberg Tavern attack in Cape Town and the St James church attack and in respect of all those three attacks, applications for amnesty were made and were granted.\n\tWe have pointed out to you the numbers of this Committee's decisions.  We submit that there is a common thread that runs through all these incidents, including the Claremont restaurant attack, that they were given instructions by senior APLA leaders, that these instructions were not questioned.  Whether they came from the High Command to the Commander of the Unit or instructions given by the Unit Commander to the members of his Unit.  In all of these attacks, the applicants didn't know any of the victims personally, they therefore had no personal malice towards them, they couldn't have had.\n\tIn none of these attacks did they gain personally, we have dealt with the R1 000-00 that was given to Shiceka.  It is uncontroverted on the evidence that he used it for food, accommodation, clothing and so on, for him and members of his Unit.  In all these attacks, a vehicle was stolen and then subsequently abandoned.  And importantly for the purposes of the political affiliation, association and the political objective, APLA claimed responsibility for these attacks.\n\tThe pattern is clear, we submit.\n\tWe submit therefore that the requirements of Section 21 and those set out in 20 and the criteria set out in 22 and 23 have been met.  We then quote from a dicta in the St James church application which we say is of application also in these applications before you.\n\tWe deal in paragraph 9 on page 11 with the affidavit filed on behalf of Ms Amanda Warner, where she had submitted that the requirements of 23 had not been met.  We say that it is not in fact disputed that the attacks were politically motivated, that the applicants were members of APLA and the PAC, that they acted on instructions from the APLA High Command and that they didn't know any of the victims, including Ms Warner, that the applicants did not gain materially or personally from any of these attacks, that the attacks were in line with APLA policy and then I think just importantly we say that in any event, Adv De Jager SC, a member of this Committee, had made an important observation in the Amy Biehl application, where he said and perhaps I just want to read that back.\n\tIt is however not a prerequisite for amnesty that the offence should fall within the category set out in Section 23(f).  The Committee often pointed out in previous decisions that Section 23 provides criteria or guidelines to assist the Committee to decide whether an act is associated with a political motive or not.  The provisions are criteria and not requirements or preconditions that must be complied with.\n\tWe submit that in any event, they had complied.  Our submissions are repeated in respect of the other attacks, the Khayelitsha train attack, the Khayelitsha Police vehicle attack, the Crossroads Police attack and the Guguletu Police van attack.\n\tChairperson, unless there is anything you or one of your Committee members wish to ask of me, our submissions are set out in writing.",

            "Yes, Chairperson indeed.  First if I may attend to my learned colleague's submission.  I just have a problem with two of the paragraphs therein.\n\tFirstly paragraph 9.3, my colleague alleges that it is not disputed that the applicants acted in accordance with instructions.  It was in fact disputed in that I alleged that the instructions were not so broadly phrased as to include attacks on civilian targets.\n\tSecondly in paragraph 9.6, it is alleged that the attack was in line with APLA policy and that this was also never disputed.  I did in fact dispute that.  I disputed the fact that APLA at that time had a policy of attacking so-called soft targets or civilian targets.\n\tI now turn to my closing argument.  The purpose of an inquiry by the Amnesty Committee cannot be seen in isolation from the aims and objectives of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\tIn order to reconcile ourselves with the injustices committed against ourselves, by our fellow Africans, it is necessary that we understand what it was that motivated people to commit acts of violence against others.\n\tOnly once we are able to figuratively stand in the shoes of our former enemies, is forgiveness possible.  This is why it is of crucial importance that amnesty applications are not rubber stamped in the absence of opposition thereto.  Whether or not the victim's opposition to the amnesty application at hand, can be categorised as having been successful, depends not so much on whether or not the Commission grants amnesty, as to whether or not the truth has emerged and whether this has been of assistance in the process of reconciliation.\n\tHaving heard the evidence of the applicant and having been afforded the opportunity of testing this evidence in cross-examination, I am in a position to re-access the opposing affidavit of my client, and to make the following concessions:\n\tAt paragraph 18.1 thereof it is accepted that the act was indeed associated with a political objective committed within the course of the conflicts of the past.  \n\tAt paragraph 18.2 thereof, it is accepted that the applicant was indeed a member of a publicly known organisation or movement bona fide in furtherance of a political struggle which was at the time, being waged against the State by the aforesaid organisation, to wit the PAC and its armed wing, APLA.\n\tAt paragraph 18.4(a) thereof it is accepted that the applicant was indeed motivated by something other than malice and hatred of white people.  There is however an important (indistinct) to this concession, in that it is alleged that a hatred of whites in their capacity as oppressors of the African people, must have been and indeed was, a contributing motivational factor.\n\tThe applicant does not appear to have shown remorse in the time immediately following the attack, and even went so far as to say that had a white person been killed in the train station attack, he would have been more satisfied with the relative success of this operation.\n\tParagraph 18.4(b) thereof it is conceded that the offence was indeed committed within the context of a political uprising, disturbance or event or a reaction thereto.\n\tAt paragraph 18.4(1) thereof it is accepted that the act may be seen as being proportional to the objectives of the organisation, namely the liberation of the African people from oppression.  It is further conceded that this act and similar acts, may have influenced the demise of the Apartheid system.\n\tAt paragraph 18.4(k) thereof, it is accepted that the applicant bore no personal grudge against the victims of this attack, other than that which he may have held against them as a class of people he refers to as the oppressors.\n\tIt is conceded that it is probable that the R1 000-00 given to the applicant, did not constitute payment for his services and that he was not a mercenary.\n\tIt follows from the aforementioned that it is accepted that the applicant was indeed a member of APLA and that he did receive some nature of orders from his Commander known as Power.\n\tIt is not clear what the plan referred to by the applicant, was when he arrived in Cape Town.  He says he told his comrades what the mission was, but the details of this mission were not forthcoming on cross-examination.\n\tThis was the first time the applicant had been involved in an attack on a purely civilian target, yet he denies that he was ever aware of any significance to be attached to this.\n\tNot only were these people civilians, but they were unarmed and no attempt was in any event made, nor was it alleged to have been made, part of the plan to acquire arms during this operation.  On the contrary it would appear as if they made sure that no Policemen were present at the time when the attack was launched.\n\tThe attacks on civilians at St James church, Heidelberg Tavern and Crazy Beat disco only took place during 1993 and 1994.  It is unclear why the applicant was under the impression that he bought tobacco from a restaurant that firstly does not sell tobacco or did not sell tobacco, and secondly was only open for business in the evenings, and the applicant claimed to have bought tobacco from the restaurant during the day.\n\tHe could have mistakenly viewed the two adjoining establishments as one.  It is conceded that this is possibly an easy error to make.  It is noteworthy that the attackers arrived in a Datsun 1200 motor car, left the driver in the car, yet all three are alleged to have escaped in a bakkie.\n\tThe Mitchell's Plain Magistrate's courts were known to have been experiencing serious problems during the time in which the applicant was acquitted, ostensibly for lack of evidence and it is submitted that not too much reliance ought to be placed thereon.\n\tBe that as it may, it is also true that the applicant stands to gain little from the amnesty application, and it cannot be said therefore that his application is motivated purely by self interest.\n\tIt is conceded that this ought to count in the applicant's favour.  The applicant's argument that all white people underwent compulsory military training, deserves further attention.\n\tOnly white adult males between the ages of 17 and I speak under correction here, 55 were liable for military service.  Full time students were exempted from such service for the period of their studies.  Females were not required to undergo military training.\n\tThe training was compulsory and the penalties for refusing to undergo training, was severe.\n\tNot all white people supported military training, or for that matter, the Apartheid system.  It is that very generalisation that forms a core component of the concept of racism.\n\tIt is however, recognised that racism was indeed a feature of the past, and viewed against this background, the views of the applicant at the time, are hardly surprising.\n\tThe applicant's distinction between a guerrilla fighter and a terrorist is noted and it is accepted that he viewed himself in terms of the former.\n\tIt is not for me to decide whether or not the applicant has met the requirements for amnesty as set out in the Act.  I wish to state however, that whatever the decision of the Committee, it has the support of my client, Ms Warner, and I would like to convey her instructions to me that knowing what happened and hearing the applicant's version thereof, has been of assistance to her, and although she has no desire to meet with the applicant at present, she does not rule out the possibility of such a meeting in the future.\n\tShe is particularly impressed by his decision to come forward and take responsibility for the attack, when he was never convicted in respect thereof.\n\tThose are my submissions Mr Chairman.",
