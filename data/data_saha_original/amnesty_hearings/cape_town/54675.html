<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   Chairman today is the 11th of March '97 sitting here in Cape Town, a continuation in the Van Vuuren et al application.  Mr Chairman as per schedule we were supposed to hear the matters on the date of 28 February 1997, but as already explained to the Chair in Chambers, we will go to matters that follow thereafter under the date, 3rd March 1997, and I will hand over everything in the hands of my learned friend. Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Yes Mr du Plessis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman we intend to call Brigadier Cronje first this morning.  We intend to call him in respect of two matters, the first matter you will find on page 156 of his bundle of applications.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Can you just hold on.  Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman that is a matter that deals with the bomb blast in Gaberone.  Now in the Schedule it is set out, it refers to the death of Mackenzie, Mackenzie didn't die, so that is wrong, it doesn't refer or doesn't deal with the death of Mackenzie, it deals with the bomb blast in Gaberone. May I be permitted to call Brigadier Cronje?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Yes please do.</p>

<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman if you will just bear with me for one moment, I just want to sort something out with Mr Mpshe, before I go ahead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>	Brigadier Cronje on page 156 you said that the incident happened, could you please start reading from your application from the first paragraph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Johannes Mnisi was a former askari at Vlakplaas and he decided to rejoin the ANC.  He then went into exile in Botswana and from there he launched and planned a variety of terrorist activities, he was one of the main planners of, for instance, the Church Street Bomb. According to information he also planned other landmine explosions and other acts of terror.  Some of these acts caused the deaths of innocent people, according to our information at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Now Brigadier can you remember, relating to the Church Street bomb, were innocent people killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Could you continue, next paragraph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> There was an informer, a certain Mackenzie who was a member of my department's informers and he infiltrated Mnisi's organisation. Brigadier Wikus Loots, the commander of the Security Police in the Western Transvaal approached me about this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Before you continue, let us stop with Mackenzie. You say that he infiltrated Mnisi's organisation, what exactly did he do for the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> He smuggled weapons out of Gaberone and brought back weapons for the ANC back to the Republic and he CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	3	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>then established certain bodies and reported back about the nature of these bodies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> What are these bodies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Arms caches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Could you continue with the third paragraph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> He was largely an operative of yours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Third paragraph Brigadier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Brigadier Wikus Loots, the head of the Security Branch in Western Transvaal, approached me about this matter.  He told me that  - that must be the "elimination" of Mnisi, not neutralising. And this was discussed with General van der Merwe and that he received instructions to continue. He contacted me and asked me to assist him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier, any other persons, were they mentioned apart from Mnisi, can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes two.  Pulu and Demakudu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Could you continue on page 158?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Loots knew Mackenzie and suggested to me that Mackenzie must be sent through with a vehicle.  Mackenzie's vehicle was then taken to Special Forces after I could mention, after we'd had meeting with Commandant Charl Naude of Special Forces. Charl Naude then planted a bomb into the vehicle and this was controlled by remote control and also by means of a light sensor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier I would like you to explain to the Committee, you say there was a remote control device here which could operate the bomb and then a light sensor as well. Could you briefly describe the difference between the</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	4	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>two mechanisms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> The remote control would have been handled by one of Naude's people physically, he would have observed the combi and he would then activate the bomb by means of remote control.  The light sensor was built into a secret compartment or panel which Mackenzie and the ANC used to use to conceal explosives and in so doing cross the border with these explosives in the car.  Now the light sensors would have immediately become operative once the compartments were opened and the bomb would then explode and it would only be somebody who actually knew where the compartment was, who would then activate the light sensor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier, please stop there for a moment. The tracing of this particular compartment, would that have been done by an expert?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes. It would have to be a person who knew where that compartment was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Continue please, third paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I had talks with Brigadier Loots as well as  with Commandant Charl Naude's Special Forces to plan the operation. Charl Naude told us that he had agents in Botswana and that he would arrange for one of those agents  to pass on the information when Mnisi was in the vehicle and Mackenzie not being in the vehicle at the time, so that the bomb could be activated by means of remote control. What happened there was that Mackenzie booked into a motel on the outskirts of Gaberone and one of these Paulo Demakudu or Mnisi would have fetched the combi from him, inserted the explosive and handed it back to Mackenzie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Was that the planning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes the planning was and that is what would</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	5	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>normally happen.         </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> I just want to correct this. You said what happened. Is your evidence that what normally happened, was that Mackenzie would book into the hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Correct, continue please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> So that the bomb could be exploded by remote control as soon as Mnisi entered the vehicle,  the agent would ensure that Mackenzie was not in the vehicle at the time.  The plan was put into operation and Mackenzie was sent with the motor bomb to Gaberone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier could you please tell the Committee what the chances would have been that this motor car bomb with Mackenzie in the car would have exploded in the process of the driving of the vehicle from here across the border?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No such chance, absolutely no such chance without the bomb being activated by means of the light sensor or remote control.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> So please continue with the sentence, "I later learnt that....?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I later learnt that, from Mackenzie himself exactly what had happened to him.  He told me that he left the combi at a place unknown to him, weapons were loaded into the combi to smuggle back into the Republic, however  ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Was it 'unbeknown to him or unbeknown to me'?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I don't understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Your answer was interpreted as, 'he left the combi at place unbeknown to him'?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	6	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No, to me.  Whilst he was in Gaberone he told me that he had to go to Zambia, specifically Lusaka for further training.  The ANC apparently already knew at that time that he was one of our informers and he told me that on the boat crossing the Zambezi River, they assaulted him and broke his arm.  He was taken to Quatro Camp where he was further detained and tortured.  As a result of the above the whole plan went awry and I later learned from the newspaper that the bomb the bomb exploded unplanned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Could you stop there, unplanned, what do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> By that I mean that the bomb exploded without Mnisi or any of the other two being in the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Do you have any knowledge of exactly how the bomb exploded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I don't but I have a suspicion which I can express here, that what happened, the bomb exploded when the secret compartment was opened and the light sensor was activated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> But you don't know exactly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Could you continue with that middle paragraph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> After the bomb had exploded the number of the plates of the vehicle were traced by the Botswana Police and in this way it became known that the vehicle was Mackenzie's vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier perhaps just continue with the last paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I remember when the bomb exploded in Gaberone, there were a lot of headlines in the newspaper and CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>

<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>the Botswana Government made objections to the South African Government and the Foreign Minister, Pik Botha at the time alleged that Mackenzie was a member of the ANC and had blown himself up with the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier could we stop there for a moment before we continue.  Was there any report back to you about this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No, the operation was actually Brigadier Loots's affair and I just assisted in the whole operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier, in relation to the exploding of the bomb, what was the actual target for the explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> It was Mnisi, Pulu and Demakudu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> According to the planning, would the bomb have exploded if civilians could be injured in the vicinity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Would the bomb have exploded if unknown people were in the vicinity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No that was not part of the planning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> And the Special Forces agent, was he in Gaberone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> The person operating the remote control?</p>

<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Was he the person who would have operated the remote control, in other words would he decide when the bomb was to explode?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes.  Yes he had photographs of these people and he would only explode the bomb if they were there.</p>

<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> There's no doubt that Minister Botha must have known what the true situation was, it was essential to CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>

<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>	This action was also taken during a time when there was a situation of total onslaught or war in the country and it was general policy in respect of ANC terrorists, especially those responsible for serious acts of terror, to eliminate these. It was also in line with the pro-active conduct of the defence force and was also in line with the general instructions from Brigadier Victor and Brigadier Schoon and furthermore, also that General van der Merwe approved of these plans.</p>

No other steps were possible against Mnisi apart from eliminating him.  He couldn't be arrested because he was in Botswana and there was no other legal way in which we could act against him.  The only way to effectively neutralise him would be to eliminate him.</p>

I'm sorry to do this but I've been listening to the translation and there was reference to a certain Pretorius which was wrong. It was not a right translation of the evidence.

<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Yes.</p>

Other members could have been present but I can't remember their names.  He did not point out houses in Mamelodi and also did not point out terrorists.  We then drove along a gravel road to Bophuthatswana where the man was further questioned.  Prinsloo and du Plessis sat at the back of the combi and</p>

<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier please stop there. Did you extract any information of any value out of him during interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> He gave information which meant something but I can't remember the exact nature of the information.   I can't remember exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier was the intention during this interrogation to eventually eliminate him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No that was not the intention, because we wanted more information out of him, so that was not our aim.</p>

<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> It was essential to interrogate activists like these to obtain essential information about the ANC's activities.  The activist's death was an accident and it was not our intention to eliminate him and I never gave such an instruction. A limpet mine was available in the vehicle, my members always used to carry these around with them, some of my members who were actively involved in combating acts of terror, often had weapons of Russian origin in their vehicles with my knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier on this last point, I would like to make sure, this limpet mine, the limpet mine wasn't carried around in the vehicle specifically for this operation?</p>

<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> At the bottom of page 153 you say, please read the last sentence on 153.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> The objectives and aims were to question an ANC supporter.  It was necessary to obtain information from the activist, interrogation was the normal procedure and I believed that the activist had valuable information.  The activist died before he could give any information, but it is possible that he could have given information, I've forgotten, I refer back to the general background above.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> And right at the bottom, 11(a), page 154?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I acted in terms of the general instructions of Victor, mentioned under General Background.</p>

<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV DU PLESSIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I have been engaged in trials both as counsel and as a judge for many years where the police have given evidence about interrogations, where the accused has given evidence about interrogations, and it was not considered necessary to take a man off into the bush and strangle him to interrogate him.  Why didn't you question him in the normal way, you had powers to detain him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Chairperson it was at night, we didn't want to do it in a built-up area, we wanted to do it outside somewhere where it was quieter.  You're correct, we did have powers to question him further but that was the practice.  They beat him during interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> By interrogation in your sense of the word, you really mean torturing him, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>JUDGE MALL	15	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes, he was assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> I think that is a correct word, it is not merely an interrogation where questions are put and answers elicited. He was tortured physically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And as a result of that torture he died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Now Brigadier it would seem to me that, or perhaps I should ask you this, it must have been clear at some stage that the deceased was severely beaten with obvious injuries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes I saw that and I didn't stop it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> You say that the intention was not to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> What did you intend to do with such a severely beaten person with obvious injuries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Chairperson at this stage I can't say, if it was so serious that we couldn't detain him any further, then the possibility would have been that we would have eliminated him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Well that is what is troubling me. It seems to me that the person was so severely injured that you had no option but simply to eliminate him, and therefore in that sense you cannot say that there was no intention to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Let me put it this way. The injuries which he sustained as a result of the beating weren't that serious, but he died because they strangled him.  That was not the aim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Well after the assault that was inflicted on CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE	16	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>him what chance did he have to be released back from your custody into society?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> He probably would have laid a charge of assault, but at that stage we were all witnesses and we would all have denied this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Was it not in that time a practice on the part of the security police that people severely beaten and injured during interrogation would be eliminated, some of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes that is so but I would rather have obtained information from him about terrorist houses and activities and he had this information.  I would rather have obtained that information than to kill him at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> I assume that the reason why he was beaten was that he did not give you the kind of information that you people wanted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> That is correct.  He didn't want to point out the homes and houses in Mamelodi, so I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> And it must have been clear wasn't it, at some stage that if despite such a severe assault, he was not bringing out any information then probably he didn't have any information and there was no need to keep him alive anyway?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> According to our information he really did have this necessary information about terrorists, otherwise we wouldn't have beaten him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> But after a severe assault it become clear that this person possessed no information, otherwise with this kind of assault and torture he would have given the information, he would have disclosed it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> If he remained alive he might have given it</p>

<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE	17	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>to us but they carried on with the strangling and the throttling for too long and that's why he died.         </p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Now you say that this landmine that was in the vehicle was not being carried around for the purpose that was used that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> That's correct Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> For what purpose was it carried around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I said that members of staff always or constantly had this type of weapon, weapons, including limpet mines in their possession, with my full knowledge, but that was not the purpose that evening to use the limpet mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Yes you say so, you told us that they used to carry it around, but what I want to know from you is the purpose for which it was carried around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> It could be that for instance when they had a case such as this or where they have an activist, find an activist's house, then they would use this landmine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So it was carried to use against either people like this or activists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Were you surprised to see it in the vehicle that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Not at all, I knew that they were carrying around this type of thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Were you surprised that it was used to blow up the body of this person to pieces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No, after he died I gave instructions for him to be blown up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> But you told them to use this particular landmine to blow his body to pieces.</p>

<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I just want to make sure again, the translation says landmine but it's a limpet mine, there's a big difference between them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> A limpet mine, I think it was my fault, I think I spoke of a landmine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> A landmine ja, but the interpretation was also a landmine and as you know a limpet mine is a lot different from landmine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Well what you said was that you were not surprised that it was used for that purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Had it been used for that purpose before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> There were such cases, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> When you got into the vehicle, you were aware that this was, is it a limpet mine, I don't know the difference, were you aware that it was there in the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No not at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> From whom was this information obtained that the activist concerned knew about the presence of terrorists around Mamelodi? From whom had you obtained that information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> That would have been from informers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And how reliable was this information obtained from the informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> During questioning at the office he admitted that he was aware of such houses and that he would point out such houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> So you started questioning the activist concerned in your office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes they first questioned him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And what did this questioning entail the use</p>

<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>of force on him at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> He wasn't assaulted in the offices, we wouldn't have done it there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> So he merely volunteered information without any force ever being used by your members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Was it therefore not strange, that when he had to point out the houses concerned he was unable to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I was surprised, I didn't question him myself but the information which my people gave me, du Plessis, was that he was able to point out these houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Now when du Plessis and the other member of your staff throttled this guy, where were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I was in front next to the driver of the vehicle, that's where I was sitting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Did you witness the throttling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Some of it yes, but not the whole interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> You were in a position to stop them from doing that as a senior officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I was in a position but I didn't do so.</p>

<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> I have some difficulties, when you say that there was no intention to kill this man. Is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> If that was so then this man was being tortured to a point when despite the torture, he was not giving any information.  Is that so?</p>

<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No I don't think so because at the offices he did give the information, so I don't know whether he couldn't point out the houses or whether he didn't know where the houses were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Any person in his position, questioned and tortured as he was would reach a stage when he cannot bear the pain and would then give the information that is expected of him, don't you expect that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> My next question is that even if he did give you that information after that torture, it would never have been possible for you to release him. So he would have had to be killed in any case after you had got the information.  Isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No Chairperson, the injuries which he sustained, these injuries were caused by hand but it was the throttling that killed him, but his external injuries were not serious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Yes but if he was released he would have revealed all this torture that he had been submitted to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes he could but we would just have denied it because there were more of us than him, he was alone.  We would have denied it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> So was it your decision ultimately that he should be blown up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You were asked by Judge Mgoepe a few minutes</p>

<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>JUDGE WILSON	21	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>ago and you said that you saw that the deceased was seriously beaten with obvious injuries and you did not stop it.  You are now trying to tell us his external injuries were not serious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No what I said was that the injuries were not that serious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> He was seriously beaten with obvious injuries is what you said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I assume that he had injuries but they were not that serious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You saw them surely, you didn't assume, you gave evidence that he had obvious injuries, that means you saw the injuries, or do you want to change your story?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No I saw the injuries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Sitting in the dark in this vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> At one point we did actually get out of the vehicle where we were interrogating him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And assault him outside, you haven't told us a word about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No they were still inside the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But what do you mean you got out of the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> We stopped and I got out and the others also got out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And you left them torturing him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I left them there, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You may not have seen the torture you must have heard it, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And outside the vehicle and he was being tortured inside the vehicle, you were still able to tell us</p>

<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Brigadier how long did this assault last whilst he was in the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Approximately a half an hour, maximum.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> What kind of vehicle were you driving?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> A 16-seater combi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> In previous cases where information had been given and the person did not want to join, for instance become an askari, did you kill him, or some of your staff members killed him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes I think that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Now would that not have happened in this case as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Chairperson as I've said, I was more keen to obtain the information out of this man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But let us assume you eventually did get the information out of him, what would you have done with him then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Then we would have tried to persuade him to work for us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And if he didn't want to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Then we would have charged him along with these people he pointed out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And let him go to court and tell the court all about your tortures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes but as I said we would have denied it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Yes but once you detained him he could be examined by a district surgeon who would see these strangulation marks around his neck and the other visible</p>

<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Well we wouldn't immediately detain him, we had a place where we could keep people like these until they recovered from their injuries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Where, I want the address, details of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> We could have for instance, have detained him at Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You did that, you took injured people to Vlakplaas did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> We could have done so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> To recover? Did you do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> We did yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So there can be other evidence of injured people who were brought to Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> It is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> If you did it, it's not possible, it would happen, wouldn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes, I misunderstood.  Yes we did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And you would then have to explain how it was that he disappeared from the time that you took him away to the time you finally charged him in a court of law?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I suggest to you that this is not so Brigadier, that rather you did, as my brother suggested, you eliminated them to avoid all these possible problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> That is also possible that we could have eliminated them, I'm not saying it is not possible.</p>

<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> How many people were involved in this, your staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> As far as I can remember, only two people were involved, Prinsloo and du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> You didn't take part in the torture yourself? ...(tape ends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No I didn't, not myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Were you not in charge of the operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes Chair, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Now if you were in charge of the operation and, as you have testified, that it was an accident that this man was eliminated, why didn't you stop the throttling on him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Well I could have stopped it but I did not expect that they would throttle him so long that he would die.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> How long throttling does it take a man to die?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> It's quite quick, I'm not exactly sure but I think it would be quick.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Yes but you saw these two men throttle this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> What did you expect from the throttling when you saw them do it?</p>

<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No not all the time, it was dark in the car, it was just after we got out, then the light was on but</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>further I sat in the front and they were in the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> You could be affected by the darkness and going out, how long did you witness their throttling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> It is difficult for me to say now, it could have been a couple of seconds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> By the two men?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes by both of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Brigadier really did you expect the man to survive being throttled by two men and after this man has been tortured and assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I did not expect that they would throttle him that long, so long that he would die.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Well as the officer in charge, why didn't you watch and when you could see what was going on tell them to stop, you were responsible, you gave the orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes I was responsible but I did not watch them all the time, I was looking in front of me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> And Brigadier you told us that his death was an accident, and I never gave such an order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> That's right I never gave an order that he must be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Well we shall be correct if we draw an inference or come to a conclusion that these men who throttled and killed him acted on their own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No no it was my responsibility because I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> If you say you accept responsibility, are</p>

<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE	26	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>you saying you accept responsibility for what you they did in your presence and you quietly just allowed it to happen, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes that is what I am saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Now I'm a bit perplexed here, if you say you accept responsibility and you quietly allowed what was happening, and then you say you did not give that instruction. How could you not give an instruction and at the same time accept what they were doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I accept what they did because I could have stopped them and I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Let us confine ourselves to the action of the two men and stick to your statement that you did not give that instruction.  Can we say that they acted without an instruction and as such what they did did not fall within the ambit of your operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No it was not the intention to kill them, I never gave such an order but I accept responsibility for it because I allowed it to happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did you condone it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> That I understand, I understand further that you condoned what they did, but what I'm saying is, put aside the condonation, can we say, the two men, what they did by killing this man, they did outside the ambit of the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes it was not the intention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> If it was outside the ambit of the operation then it becomes a pure criminal matter?</p>

<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> You haven't responded to my question, whether this becomes now a pure criminal matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No it was done with a political aim, we did kill activists.  The assault and his death were both to gain information about terrorists in the Republic and who wanted to overthrow the government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Brigadier when you planned this operation, your intention, your aim was to acquire information, elicit information from this man, that was the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes information with regard to terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Good, and when you planned it as such in order to get information and you did not at that stage plan the killing or the elimination of this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Good, that is why I say that the killing that was not part of your operation, it becomes a criminal matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No I do not agree with you, the aim was to get information about terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> The death of this man, the murder of that man, it was still done with a political aim but it was not part of the plan, of this operation.</p>

<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But as I understood you, there was no aim at all.  The death was accidental, negligent, culpable homicide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> It was by accident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Yes, you didn't intend to kill him, so you had no political aim in bringing about his death. The death</p>

<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>JUDGE WILSON	28	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>was brought about as a result of their negligence in continuing to strangle him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes but with the aim of getting information from him about terrorists.  The aim of those terrorists was to overthrow the South African Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Brigadier I suppose your statement that you would have denied the assault on the deceased should be considered against the fact that in the past, from my experience both at the side bar and in the bar, in the past, whenever an accused person came to court to say that he had been assaulted by the police, in many instances, the court never believed such a person and the court in fact believed the police when they so denied the assault, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> I could not have these people prosecuted in such a case, all the other operations would have suffered under that and been abandoned.</p>

<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>get your answer to this, I want to get some clarity, did you ever have the intention up to his death, to eliminate him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> The possibility that you conceded to, does that relate to later actions of yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Now Brigadier is it possible that you could have decided to detain him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Is it possible that you would have been able to question him later in detention as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier was it usual for the security police to eliminate people who could talk about questioning later on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No it was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> The nature of these injuries, were these injuries of such a nature that he would have died from that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier just to make it clear to the Committee, what is the difference between a limpet mine and a landmine, could you explain it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> A landmine, I'm not an explosives expert, but a landmine is used to blow up a vehicle, a limpet mine is much smaller and can be used for many other things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> I want you to explain to the Committee where a landmine is usually planted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> In a road under the ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> And a limpet mine?  Where is a limpet mine placed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> It can be placed on any metal object.</p>

<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Does a limpet mine work like a magnet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> In other words, Brigadier, a limpet mine can for example be put in a toilet against a wall or any other place, it doesn't have to be put under the ground, or buried under the ground?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No it's not necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> The further questioning Brigadier, did that take place close to, in the vicinity of the place where the person would have pointed out the houses to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No it was far away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Brigadier, I just want to ask you, the methods used with regard to the questioning, was that the methods used by the security police against activists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV DU PLESSIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Does that mean it is the practice of the security police not to question activists in police stations or other such, but to take them out into the bush and torture them?  That is the general practice of the security police, or was it the practice of your unit only?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> It was the general practice of the security police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Brigadier, why was it necessary to blow up the body with a limpet mine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Mr Chair so that the impression would be created once again, that he was playing with this limpet mine or that he wanted to leave it in the road and that he in this way blew himself up. It was supposed to seem that way, as if he did it himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> So it's not like a case that we heard before, CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>

<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a>that the body was blown into several minute pieces.  Did you blow it into several minute pieces or did you only blow it once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Only once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Brigadier, was it also normal practice of your unit, in particular, to take people to Vlakplaas to interrogate them there, where there were better facilities for this kind of interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Chair, no we did not question people at Vlakplaas, there were usually other people with us, we never actually questioned people there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Why was this place chosen in Bophuthatswana, you were from Mamelodi, why could he not be questioned in some dark area in Mamelodi?  Was it a place which you had previously used for this kind of interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Could you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Why did you choose this specific place in Bophuthatswana, you were from Mamelodi where this activist was supposed to point out houses in Mamelodi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> It was a very secluded place where we took him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Had you used it before for this kind of interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> Yes we had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Had you killed anyone there before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG CRONJE:</span> No.</p>

<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Captain Hechter, on page 101, Nature and Particulars.  Captain Hechter, before you give any evidence about this matter, would you please turn to page 18 of the application.  Captain, we've already heard evidence here relating to your problems with your memory, and there's one aspect which I would like you to read to the Committee, page 18, first paragraph, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> My memory is very bad and certain facts I can't recall at all. Certain events in this application I could only remember afterwards during consultation and I was told by a psychologist that that could be the effect of post-traumatic stress, and a report from a psychologist will be offered in testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Captain Hechter, we've seen and heard that some things you can remember in detail and others you can't remember at all and others you only have a vague recollection of, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Now bearing that in mind, could you go to page 101 and read that for the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> My memory is not good as far as this incident is concerned, I remember an incident where I fastened an activist to a telephone pole and he was blown up with a limpet mine so that it would look as if he had blown himself up by accident.  He was already dead when he was</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	34	CAPT HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a>blown up. I can't remember how he died, he was already dead when he was blown up and I can't remember who else was present.  I can't remember where it took place. I may just mention that the exact place I can't recall but it was in Bophuthatswana district or area, to the North West of Pretoria, somewhere in that area, I can't remember the exact place, but it was in that area. I'm not a hundred percent certain, but I think that there was also a second activist who was eliminated in the same way. As far as this event is concerned, I'm more and more certain that there was a second activist who died in the same way but I can't recall a name or a specific place or date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Captain Hechter, the statement which you make here, that there was a second activist who was eliminated in the same way.  I want it to be understood in the correct context.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> It was on a different occasion, it had nothing to do with this particular event.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Now was this activist blown up, these activists, were they blown up by limpet mines or were they dead before they were blown up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> They were already dead when they were blown up.  Blowing up was only done to conceal their identity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> So the reference in the fourth paragraph, the reference is made to eliminated in the same way, that is not entirely correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Because they were not eliminated by means of the blowing up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> Yes.  They were killed beforehand and I then blew them up with a limpet mine so that their identities</p>

<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a>could not be ascertained, at that stage many of the activists left the country voluntarily for training abroad and their family members didn't always know that they were about to leave the country, and in this way it was also not possible for their family members to know where their loved ones were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Captain Hechter, could you read the fourth paragraph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> The Name and Place where, that is unknown, as I've already explained.  I know it was in Bophuthatswana somewhere.  If it is put to me that there was no such an incident, I will not be able to dispute that.  It is only a vague recollection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> That's the second case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> Yes. I don't want to sound insensitive because I can't furnish you with the details but I simply can't remember anything except what I have already stated in my application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Captain Hechter, during, and I'm now going to ask you a general question which will probably be relevant to other applications as well, from October to now, relating to these applications now before the Committee ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> October last year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, yes Mr Chairman.  October last year, when you appeared here and these applications were drafted, relating to these applications before the Committee, have you had conversations with other people who were implicated in the applications?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> Continuously yes.  I was continuously having talks with my fellow applicants.</p>

<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> And could you remember certain things after you were told them by your fellow applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> Some things became clearer to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> And in each application where you have a problem with your memory and where you have now received such information, have you testified additionally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Is this an incident where you did receive further information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> I know this will be speculation Captain Hechter, but your action vis a vis this activist, could you tell the Committee, you testified that they were already dead, do you know how they died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> Unfortunately not at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> And if we accept that there is a possibility that you killed them, can we accept such a possibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> Yes, I would have killed them personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> If that is the case, for what reason would you have acted against these activists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> I've already said previously and testified that only activists who were very active and who were high profile activists and who became a problem for us, who were identified by means of source reports, more than one source report, they were identified as activists and it would have been better for the Branch to have them eliminated. I would certainly not just have picked somebody up on the streets and eliminated him, it would have been somebody who would have been a problem for the branch.  A high profile political activist.  That was the kind of person I would</p>

<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Would this person have been involved in the politics of the liberation movements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> At that stage definitely, he would have been very active, in most cases Mamelodi, Soshanguve, Attridgeville, he would have been active in those areas and he would have been a main figure in the boycotts, assaults, arson, by boycotts I mean school boycotts, bus boycotts, transport boycotts, consumer boycotts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> And would you have acted against people who weren't politically active in the liberation movements and their activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> If he was only active, I wouldn't have acted against him, he had to be really prominent and reports must have indicated that he was involved in acts of terror, whether burning down of police homes or throwing of hand grenades, etc.</p>

<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> The context in which it took place was against the background of an emergency.</p>

<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> The actions would have been according to the general command of General Victor, the elimination of the activists, although I can't remember, would have been necessary in the light of the situation of war at that stage.  I never took part in the elimination of activists that was not justified under those circumstances, or rather not justified by those circumstances.  Such an activist</p>

<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, with the information given in the application it would have been difficult for them even to start to know where to go and what to do.</p>

<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> Mr Chair, as I said, in all probability he was from one of the Black townships, in the vicinity of Pretoria, whether Soshanguve, Attridgeville or Mamelodi.  That was basically the sphere of my action.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Can you recall who was with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> Unfortunately not at all. We have discussed it to a great extent but I suspect, and it's only a</p>

<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a>suspicion, Mamasela at one stage said that he was present.  I think he said this and it was also in the press.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Can you remember the approximate age of the activist concerned, Captain Hechter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> Unfortunately not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Can you remember what activities specifically he would have been active in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> Specifically no, I can't remember anything specific.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Mr du Plessis I don't know whether this is one of the cases which are being investigated by the Attorney General against your clients.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman my information is that it is not.  That is how I had it as well. Obviously the Committee should take into account the fact that we have a difficulty here, that is one of the difficulties pertaining to amnesty applications.  As you've noted, we've tried to include evidence and facts pertaining to all the incidents where the applicants were involved in and especially Captain Hechter and certain incidents he remembers well, and in those incidents he testified vividly.  There is, however, this problem and we have experienced this problem and I simply am not in a position myself to make further inquiries regarding this.  In other incidents Captain Hechter had Warrant Officer van Vuuren to rely on and that made it easier, but here we have no leads, we have nothing.  We could have left this out and not asked for amnesty on this, but Mr Chairman under the circumstances we wanted to include everything as far as possible that he could remember and that is why we included this application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman I just wanted to confirm what my</p>

<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	40	CAPT HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a>learned friend has said, that this matter is not being investigated by the office of the Attorney General.  What the office of the Attorney General has done is to give me documentation on all matters investigated by themselves in this application.  This is not one of them.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Mr du Plessis, or shall we leave that when you argue the matter, but I'm just trying to wonder how you had best envisage, how do you envisage the order being formulated by us in the event of amnesty being granted to look like, to be effective?  Are we just here not doing something which we simply cannot do, trying to do something we cannot do, not in the sense that we will deny amnesty but we just don't know what to give him amnesty for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman that is obviously something I still have to consider when arguing this matter, especially in this kind of matter.  This is a problem intricate to the amnesty procedure in this country Mr Chairman.   The problems that the applicants have, and that Captain Hechter has in respect of this kind of application is, for instance, let us say that the whole amnesty process is finalised, the report is written and in five or six years time somebody who might have been present there goes to the Attorney General and he says he wants to open his heart and he starts talking and he remembers everything, and it comes out and they say, oh this is a lovely case against Captain Hechter, and they bring criminal prosecutions against Captain Hechter, and at the end of the day, if he is then prosecuted, he's going to be prosecuted simply because of the fact that he had a bad memory when he had to ask for amnesty.  So in some way or another, the Committee will have to deal with this Mr</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	41	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a>Chairman, and I will assist the Committee in as far as possible in argument to see if one can't reach some sort of satisfactory solution to this kind of problem, but in some way or another an order will have to be formulated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> I appreciate that that is eminently a question of argument, and I know that you could deal with that during arguments, but I wanted to raise it specifically now while your client is still in the witness box.  I'm not saying that there is much you can do to remedy the situation while your client is still in the witness box, but I want to point out that difficulty while your client is still in the witness box because, assuming that we give amnesty in the general terms that with the evidence before us we'd have to, and the kind of situation that you gave an example of arises, how would they tie up that particular incident?  How would they recognise it as being the incident in respect of which we would have given amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes it was a broad argument now, because Mr Chairman that argument obviously doesn't necessarily relate to this but to other incidents as well.  Obviously it's a very remote possibility, I know that, but on the other hand I have a duty towards the applicants to the extent that I have to safeguard their interest as far as possible, even if it should mean that amnesty is given in respect of possibly murder, in respect of this incident on the basis of certain conditions, or that amnesty is given on the basis of the facts before the Committee or something in that fashion.  I haven't really considered it Mr Chairman.  The one thing that is obviously clear is that there was, the Afrikaans is lykskending here which he will have to apply for specifically and then contraventions of the Arms and</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	42	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a>Ammunition Act for instances. Already those contraventions are clear from this, but in respect of murder,  Mr Chairman, I will obviously have to address you specifically on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> We can't possibly grant amnesty can we, to someone who says, I might have committed a murder, I don't know, I don't know who the person was, I don't know how he came to be killed.  How can we presume that it was for a political purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, obviously one has to take into account the realities of the situation.  If the Committee comes to a decision that it cannot grant amnesty on the basis of this, and the situation arises which I foresee now, obviously one will then have to deal with a situation at that time, but Mr Chairman, I have to, on behalf on my clients, present the Committee with the question how to formulate a decision on this and to make a decision on this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But this is something he says he doesn't say he's done. I'm not talking about the explosives, there he has a recollection, here there is no evidence at all, no information as to the killing. It might have been a blood-thirsty murder, we can't give amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> No Mr Chairman but he says there was a possibility, that was his evidence, and secondly Mr Chairman he also testified that, in respect of this and specifically in respect of the possibility that there was a murder, such a murder could not have been committed otherwise than with a political objective.  That is the evidence before the Committee.  And Mr Chairman I will address you in argument on this, and if the Committee, and I specifically want to answer His Lordship Mr Judge Wilson, if the Committee makes</p>

<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	43	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a>a decision that amnesty cannot be granted in a situation such as this, I have done my duty as far as humanly possible, and obviously if the bad scenario that I sketched arises later on, I will be able to deal with it legally, but if I don't deal with now it would not open any other possible legal avenues on behalf of my client's open later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Are there no further questions of this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> No Mr Chairman I have finished this application.   The next incident I want to deal with concerns W/O van Vuuren.</p>

I want to remind the Chair and the Committee that there is an implicated person here, Eric Goosen, and that his counsel, George Alberts did approach the Committee in chambers in Pretoria.  I'm made to believe that a ruling was made that he need not be here, and he said if it comes to Cape Town he won't be here but he has no problem that the matter goes on.

<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> On page 45, can you start there and read the first paragraph to the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> Sergeant Eric Goosen and I with Kalla Botha and another person whose name I can't remember, I suspect they were from Special Forces, we went to Mamelodi where we received information that arms were brought to a certain person on a certain night in Mamelodi.</p>

<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> We picked up a black man who was probably a courier of the ANC.  We questioned him and during the questioning we beat him.  Thereafter we locked him in Sgt Goosen's garage and  we left him in the veld the next morning.  We did not get any information from him, he was seriously assaulted during the questioning.  Brigadier Cronje called us in after Kalla Botha reported to him and after Brigadier Cronje was called.  We explained it to Brigadier Cronje, he was worried that the person was dead.  He wasn't dead.  The Brigadier then reprimanded us, we were sent to his address and we ascertained that he was only injured.  He was still living.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> In other words on page 46 you describe his injuries, the person was injured, his face was swollen, his lips and eyes were hurt and his nose was bleeding. Mr van Vuuren can you remember specifically this person, the information that you received, if I can take you back to page 45, the first paragraph, you say,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a>"Information was received that two terrorists with weapons would come to this person in Mamelodi".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a>Where did you get that information from, can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> It was from Kalla Botha and his people, if I remember correctly.  They had an informant who was with us that evening, it was a Black woman, if I remember correctly.</p>

<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> In your mind, against whom did you think you were acting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> Against the ANC and against terrorists.   ADV DU PLESSIS:   Can you go to the Political Motivation, page 47, General Motivation for Interrogation, can you verify this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> But more specifically on page 50 and 51?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> You discuss the order on page 52, can you just read that to us, 11(a).</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> That's correct.  The specific order was given by Loots, at that stage Eric Goosen was with the White section and they did not know the Black areas, as we from B Section did not know the White areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> The instruction to which you refer from Brigadier Victor and Brigadier Cronje, was it the general instruction or was it, in this case, a specific instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> I will say that this from Brigadier Victor and Cronje, according to me was not really correct, I had a specific order from Loots.</p>

<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> Brigadier Victor and Brigadier Cronje would not have been aware of this specific order, it was Col Loots or then Capt Loots who gave me the specific order. I do not believe that Brigadier Victor or Cronje were on that day aware, or that night aware of what was going on</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Was the instruction by Col Loots given to you personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> Yes it was to me personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Can you recall precisely what his instructions were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> He said that there was a person with A Section who had information that a certain house in Mamelodi, there had been ANC terrorists, they came from Johannesburg and that I must assist them in the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Did you make any effort to try and trace this person?</p>

<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> It was 10 years back, I would never be able to find the address again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Did you try to contact your informer or the person who took you to the injured person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> No it was not my informant, it was Kalla Botha's informant, I did not even know the name of the informant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Did you speak to Botha and Goosen to try and help you establish the identity of this person?</p>

<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> I don't believe he would know.  They got me that evening to find the house and to show them the address, they did not know the area at all, they came from Johannesburg. It is highly unlikely, therefore, that he would know, it was the first time in his life that he went into Mamelodi that evening.  He will never be able to find the place again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> So this person as you say he was not killed, he was not killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> No he wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> He may just one day learn through the press that we have given amnesty to some people in respect of his assault, in respect of an assault on him without his knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> Yes it is possible, what I do know of course is that he did not press criminal charges.  I specifically gave orders that they had to go to the police station in Mamelodi to find out if a criminal charge had been laid for assault.  There was no such charge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Have you tried speaking to Capt Loots to ascertain the identity of the activist concerned?</p>

<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now weren't you worried about your identities being disclosed when you released this man the following day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> No the Richard Motasi incident was approximately two to three years after this incident, it was completely different.  At that stage I was not a member of the Hit Squad, yet, I was not killing people at that stage and it never crossed my mind to kill a person.</p>

<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> On page 46 of your application you mention that Brigadier Cronje spoke to you very harshly and stated that you used information which he did not verify yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Is that what happened when you undertook this operation? Did you not verify anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> No I had never verified anything myself.  I acted on the information received from Kalla Botha and his informant, that informant was with us that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> But the fact that Brigadier spoke to you harshly about this would imply that always when you carried out an operation you must investigate and verify it first, and that's why he had to tell you this?</p>

<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> No there was no time to do so, I met them at night, we went to the houses, we picked up the person, he denied that he was involved, we assaulted him, there was no time.  I would only see my sources the following night, there was in other words, no time to verify.  This specific source it was a woman who was with us that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Are you saying there was no time for you to verify or there was no time for everybody involved in the operation to verify?</p>

<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> No we didn't have any time to do this, I did not have time because these persons were quite positive about their information, they even brought the informant with them to point out the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> But that was not the fact to consider in your situation, you had to evaluate information from different sources and not to act on the information from one source?</p>

<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes there's one further matter Mr Chairman, that is the incident which you find on page 129.  Mr Chairman this is also an incident for which Captain Hechter has applied for amnesty.  I've pointed this out to my learned friend Mr Mpshe, it was never included on the list of incidents but I would request the Committee that I be afforded the opportunity to also call Captain Hechter on this specific incident because they were both involved.</p>

<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Good.  Can you please read it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> The activist was possibly involved in many bombings, necklacings in Eastern Transvaal where innocent people were killed.  He could also possibly have been involved in limpet mine explosions in Pretoria.  Captain Hechter gave the order that a certain ANC activist who was a member of cell of Harold Sefolo had to be picked up and questioned.  Information was gained from the questioning of Sefolo that he was an ANC activist.  Mamasela told us that he traced the activist in Mamelodi. Mamasela and I went to the man's shack in Mamelodi, I was in the back of the station wagon, we were going with and Mamasela would meet him at a certain point in a house in Mamelodi.  The man came out and got into the vehicle with me and Mamasela.  Mamasela and him were speaking in Tswana about irrelevant things, I have a little knowledge of Tswana.  When got out of the built up area I pushed the gun against his head and I told him that I would shoot him if he moved.  Captain Hechter was then picked up from where he was waiting in a combi with, possibly, Slang.  We put the activist in the combi and we drove off.  Hendrick Nkala was also possibly with them.  Captain Hechter then throttled him with a wire around his neck to get information from him.  After that Captain Hechter and I talked about this incident.  It could have been me as well, I just want to mention that.  He was thereafter throttled, strangled to death and we went to a very deserted road in Bophuthatswana, we put petrol on him and we wanted it to seem as if he had been necklaced.  I suspect that he was already dead when the petrol and the</p>

<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Can you remember whether you got any information from him during your questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> It was long ago.  We must have gained information from him because the name Harold Sefolo, during a previous application was given to us.  The aim was to eliminate him, so we must have gained information from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Can you remember his name at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Do you know if Captain Hechter can remember it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> I doubt if he would be able to remember it?</p>

<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> He was the senior one but our relationship at that time was not the relationship between a senior officer and a subordinate, we were friends rather by virtue of the type of work we were doing at the time so we jointly decided to eliminate the person.</p>

<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr van Vuuren, who instructed Mr Mamasela to track down this unknown activist, was it yourself or Mr Hechter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> I think it was Captain Hechter who said we should look for this person.  That was arising from the information which we got from Harold Sefolo.</p>

<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Were you then mistaken when in your application at page 131 you say that the reason why you throttled him was to obtain information?  That appears on page 131.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> That is also correct, we also strangled him to obtain information from him before we were to kill him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Well that could also have been any name. If he had given the name of any other person, that person could still have got into trouble and I'd be asking you the question, and you will still be saying to me, well he could have given any other name.</p>

Mr van Vuuren, a question was put to you which was actually done by way of a statement, I can't remember the English, but the question dealt with the strangling or the throttling, and in Afrikaans had the purport of, did you strangle him to give expression to your feeling of pleasure, if I could put it like that, a feeling of pleasure which you would have obtained from strangling this man, did you obtain any pleasure out of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">W/O VAN VUUREN:</span> No I did not derive any pleasure from killing anybody, at that stage we believed that we were doing it for our country and for our people.

Warrant Officer van Vuuren, in the light of this, I can't remember the exact words, but it was put to you that you did what you did due to a lust for torture.

<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> I think with regard to this aspect, what Mr Mpshe is trying to bring to your attention is that Mr van Vuuren told us earlier on that even though he says</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE	68	CAPT HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a>categorically in his application that he was the one who tied the wire around the neck, he told us that after discussing this aspect of the matter with you, no I'm sorry, I'm incorrect, he told us that after saying that he, despite the fact that his application, he said that you tied the wire around the neck of this person.  He told us that after a discussion of this particular aspect he could well have done it himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> It is possible that he could have done it or I could have done it, it might be possible where he could have questioned this person thoroughly, I can't remember this incident at all. I can't remember that we picked him up.  This incident is for me as if it never happened but I am willing to accept Warrant Officer van Vuuren's word.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> It just doesn't make much sense to me, why would, after discussing the matter with you, why would Mr van Vuuren no longer be sure as to whether you have done it, unless you said to van Vuuren, you are wrong, I didn't do it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> I don't know, shall we ask him Chairman, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> But he discussed this aspect with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> Yes probably during September of October we discussed many incidents I can't remember Mr Chair, I could not have told him it had not been me.  I know that for a fact, I do not know if that was so.  Nobody would know, we sat through nights discussing these things, I can't remember anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Well did you say to him that you didn't do it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> I do not believe that I would have said</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a>CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE	69	CAPT HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a>that. I would have said that I can't remember it.  Of course I can't him that I didn't do it if I cannot remember the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Did you say anything which caused him to doubt the correctness of what is written here in his application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> You cannot remember what exactly you said to Mr van Vuuren when you discussed this aspect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> It could be that you said to him, look I didn't do that, you did it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> It can be true but I really doubt it, I can't remember the incident and therefore I can't think that I would have said that.  I cannot think that I would have said, well stop the lorry, it was me not you, I can't remember the incident and therefore I can't think that I would have said anything of the sort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> So we're left with a situation where each one of you says, well I don't know, it could have been the one, another one says, it could have been the other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">CAPT HECHTER:</span> Mr Chair, I accept as I said, even if he killed him, I accept the responsibility since I had been the senior person.  If he killed him it would have been on my order or according to my order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Mr Mpshe are there any questions you wish to put at this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman I do not have questions at this stage.  But may I mention to the Committee that I have just received from the Investigative Unit information pertaining to this very incident.  I have not had time to peruse it,</p>

<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a>ADV MPSHE	70	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a>it was given to me whilst we were busy now, but after perusing this, I may request that the applicant be recalled for me to put whatever I may discover in this statement, to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> At this moment I don't have, I'm still perusing the document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Mr Mpshe, if the evidence of this witness is to stand down, as it must because I don't think there would be any point in calling upon Mr du Plessis if there's any re-examination, that should only be done after such questions as you may have, that you want to put to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Indeed Mr Chairman that would be the correct procedure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Yes.  Well once we've completed this evidence, what do we proceed to next Mr Mpshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, after completing this evidence there will be nothing to continue with today due to the fact that we shall be left with the evidence of Mr Mentz who is not in a position to testify today, we shall adjourn until tomorrow to continue with Mr Mentz.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Is that the only matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Those will be the only matters left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Yes.  Well now, that being so, how much time would you require to go through that document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, ten minutes would be apposite.</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Should we adjourn for a very short while, five minutes or so, or ten minutes, would it inconvenience anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> I think Mr Chairman that speaking for myself, ten minutes would suffice, and for my learned friend as</p>

<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	71	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a>well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Mr du Plessis would it inconvenience you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Not at all Mr Chairman. I may mention that the only matters which seem to be left would be the matters ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> There are two, one is, you've reserved your decision in respect of Mr Cronje?</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, yes, but I think Mr Chairman, I'll give you the final decision tomorrow morning but I think I have given you an indication of my view on that, and then there are only three incidents of Captain Mentz.  The three applications of Capt Mentz.  Then I may mention, Mr Chairman, just to put you in the picture, I intend recalling Capt Mentz in respect of the evidence of Ngqulunga.  We have obtained various parts of records of previous evidence on that incident and I intend to deal with that also tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Very well, we'll adjourn for a short while, I'd like you to call us as soon as you're ready.  The purpose of it all is so as to avoid breaking for lunch now unnecessarily and then coming back and finding that in ten minutes everything is over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> ..in five minutes, if it is permitted that we resume at a quarter to two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Alternatively you can proceed with the matter.  I understand the photocopying is done for our benefit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> No Mr Chairman it is not, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Oh, is the photocopying for your benefit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman I just want to make a copy for the witness, so that when I read he must know what I'm reading and whether what I'm saying actually appears on the statement, that's all.</p>

I am indebted to the Chair and the Honourable members of the Committee for the time given to make necessary arrangements.  Mr Chairman I have no questions to put to the witness anymore.

<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> And you did indicate that there's a likelihood that we will be able to receive the psychologists report sometime during the course of tomorrow is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes Mr Chairman I am going to have a discussion with the psychologist again this evening.  I will get an indication from him when he will have it available.  He is based in Stellenbosch and he has a practice to run, so if it is not available this evening I am not sure if I am going to have it ready during the course of tomorrow because I won't have anybody to go and fetch it.  So there is a possibility that we might have to deal with it the next day but we will try our utmost Mr Chairman.  It's nearly finalised.  I had a discussion yesterday with him.  There were certain problems but that provisionally is the situation Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr du Plessis I must warn you that we can't allow this to carry on because the day after tomorrow, if we CAPE TOWN HEARING	AMNESTY/W CAPE</p>
