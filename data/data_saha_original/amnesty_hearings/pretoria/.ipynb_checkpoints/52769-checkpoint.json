On the 29th of July 1988, I received an order from General Le Roux, at that stage he was a colonel.   At that stage he was the divisional commander of the Security Branch on Krugersdorp.  His order to me and Lieutenant Louw, as demolition experts, was to create an explosive device and place it at the Highgate Shopping Centre, or at least to allow for it to be placed there.   The action, he told us, was aimed at preventing the screening of a film by the name of Cry Freedom.\n\tGeneral Le Roux explained that the order had come from the security head office and that security head office was of the opinion that the screening of the film would influence the climate of unrest and the revolutionary climate at that stage.   General Le Roux made it very clear to us in the order that there should be no injury to any person or that no person should be killed and that no damage should be done to property.",

We fabricated the device and placed it at the Highgate Shopping Centre, at the cinema, in the toilet.\n\tLieutenant Louw later contacted me via radio and told me that everything was ready, that he had completed his task.  From a public telephone box I made a call to the cinema and made a bomb threat.   After that, the police called me by radio to the cinema with a message that there was an explosive device in the theatre, that it had been found in the theatre.
