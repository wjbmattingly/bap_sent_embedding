This would be one of countless examples giving us some sense of what Chris Hani and indeed the Communist Party thought about East European Communism at this period.\n\"This particular set of quotations comes from a radio show and I remember being with Chris Hani on this particular show, it was a phone in show and members of the public were free to phone in and ask either Chris or myself what our views were on a number of matters.\n\tOne particular caller Steven, said: \"I would like to ask Mr Chris Hani if, by calling himself a communist he aligns himself with world communists - communists world-wide and Chris Hani says: \"By calling myself a communist, I align myself with the South African Communist Party with it's own history, a history of struggle against apartheid and oppression in this country.  The Communist Party - as far back as the 20's, was the only non-racial formation.\n\tAnd then he goes on, he says - he admits that: \"It is true that in the past we aligned ourselves with international communism because international communism then, was the only force which came to the assistance of the oppressed people in the world.\n\tAnd then he adds a bit later: \"Now I admit that there are problems with the International Communist Movement, it's in disarray.  There are serious problems, economic stagnation and only a few countries remain today which call themselves communist.  \n\tWe've analysed those problems, we have criticised the communist movement and we have said that the South African Communist Party's path to socialism is going to be democratic, it believes in multi-partism\" ...[indistinct] \nAnd he means socialism is not going to be prescribed to the people of South Africa.

            "Well, I think that the first point to be made in that regard is that Chris Hani had certainly served actively and auspiciously in the ranks of Umkhonto weSizwe, he was very proud of his track record and many people in South Africa admired him for his military record in the ranks of Umkhonto weSizwe and as a consequence of that he rose to the rank of Chief of Staff.\n\tHe was the number effectively, not the number - well, number three because the President of ANC was head of MK.  So, he was not actually number one in MK but he was certainly a very senior member of Umkhonto weSizwe, the armed wing of the ANC.  \n\tBut he was also a very loyal member of Umkhonto weSizwe and with the opening up of the negotiations process - with the unbanning of the ANC and the South African Communist Party, the armed struggle - there was a  cease-fire almost immediately. And then in August of 1990 with the signing of the Pretoria Minute, the ANC formally suspended the armed struggle and Chris Hani was part and parcel of that process. \n\tAfter August 1990, he remained on - within the command structures of MK, as the Chief of Staff and his role was to assist with the integration process or the impending integration process to regularise the situation in South Africa, so his role - far from launching some separate army in exile, was to see the well-being of the returning MK cadres who were returning from exile or who were emerging from prison or exile - or from underground, and to ensure that they were readied for an integration process which we knew would come as a result of the negotiations process.\n\tIn December 1991 - as I mentioned earlier, he was elected as General Secretary of the Communist Party and this then becomes his full-time deployment within the broader ANC alliance and so from that point he ceased to be the Chief of Staff of MK.  And I think again this gives an indication that his priorities at this point were not military or be it even military on route to demobilisation or reintegration into a regularised Government force.\n\tAs for the story about some new fangled notion of a new People's Party or whatever which we heard about or some kind of renegade army, we were aware of disinformation stories circulating - as I recall, some of those stories emerged in about 1992, Chris Hani himself immediately denied them.

I remember personally addressing meetings - SACP branch meetings of COSATU shop steward locals.   \n\tI was one of the people involved in the negotiations process and I remember having to answer repeatedly, questions from this base constituency.  People would say: \"You are having tea and biscuits with FW de Klerk, we are dying like flies in the townships, how can you suspend the armed struggle, how can you negotiate with the enemy\" and so a great deal of our time was spent on persuading our constituency of the importance of the negotiations process.\n\tAnd I think that probably the leading personality in this process of trying to win over the ANC constituency to the negotiations process, was Chris Hani himself.  He came with impeccable credentials as a militant, as someone that - when the armed struggle had been under way, had fought very courageously and so he used those credentials precisely to say - and there's documentary evidence in the submission that we've made, to show that he's saying to many, many audiences - diverse audiences but not least to township audiences, that we must give peace a chance, that we must take the negotiations very seriously.  \n\tAnd above all he kept repeating: \"Do not fall into the provocation trap, those who don't want to see majority rule - a non-racial dispensation in our country, are trying to provoke us into restarting an armed struggle, we must not allow that to happen\".

This is the week before his assassination and he's talking to an ANC alliance East Rand Summit of Peace and Political Tolerance and that already give a sense of the purpose of this particular meeting.  And he says to his audience - I refer to the second last paragraph at page six\n\"With all it's limitations, the National Peace Accord and the structures that have emerged from it have played a role in escalating the political costs of low-intensity warfare strategy.  The National Peace Accord and associated structures have opened a few windows on the South African Defence Force and SAP actions and that has been crucially important\"\nWhat he's trying to get across is that while we are negotiating we are dealing with other people across the table who have a twin track strategy, who are talking to us over the top of the table but are kicking us underneath.  \n\tAnd he's arguing that the best way of countering this low-intensity conflict of disinformation, of STRATCOM operations that have been directed against him personally, of assassinations, of random violence in trains and taxis, the best way of addressing it is not to meet it with counter violence but to expose it - to open the windows and doors on what was happening. \n\tAnd so he's arguing that with it's limitations, this is what the National Peace Accord has helped us to do, it's given us some idea of what the SADF and SACP are doing or were doing in Boipatong and places like this.\n\"The limited success\"\nas he goes on:\n\"of the National Peace Accord and the introduction of international monitors and good work on the ground, have all contributed to the success of some important but still tentative steps in the last period.  \tIn particular I'm thing of the resolution dispute structures which have acquired a new impotence in Northern and Southern Natal and the Midlands and I'm also thinking of the very important hostels initiative here in the PWV.\n\tIt's imperative that the ANC and it's allies become ever bolder and more creative in building a major momentum for peace.  We must draw in new forces across the political spectrum and in every sector, youth, women, religious formations, into the process.\n\tWe must relate energetically to Nkatha members on the ground, we must spearhead the peace process and we must ensure that no momentum is lost\"\nAnd he's making all of these points literally a week before his assassination.",

            "Yes, that was a vexed issue, it was a complicated issue.  The ANC led alliance had suspended the armed struggle, we were not waging an armed struggle.\n\tBut as I've said already, there was violence happening - a great deal of violence happening and in our perception the victims were either - or very often, ANC aligned people or just citizens you know, catching a train or catching a mini-bus.\n\tAnd in the face of that violence that was being visited in that period on largely the Black community, there was a major demand from our constituency that people should be able to defend themselves and this was one of their arguments for unsuspending the armed struggle, they felt that it had been - many people felt it was wrong to have suspended the armed struggle.  \n\tAnd our answer to this was that we were serious about suspending the armed struggle, it remained suspended, there was no Umkhonto weSizwe functioning as an army waging an armed struggle.  But clearly individuals, families, communities, congregations, had the right to self-defence and we felt as an ANC alliance, that we also had to assume some responsibility for assisting people to defend themselves.\n\tThe problem was of course, that when you help people to defend themselves there are dangers and that this can sometimes contribute to escalating the violence rather than to solving it and Chris Hani was well aware of this difficulty and again he was the leader most frequently deployed by the ANC alliance to try to instil discipline, to try to get across the political agenda that we had two self-defence units - some of which sometimes went off the rails.  \n\tAnd he explains why again - I think it's - yes, it's at this Peace Summit on the East Rand in the week before his death, where he helpfully gives us a sense of his analysis of the problems of the SDU's.

He was only secondarily a military person and I think that this quotation underlines that point as many other do as well.\n\"Our counter-strategy has therefore also to be essentially political, not rushing back to arms, not getting into military ...[indistinct]  The key to countering low-intensity warfare in our specific situation, is to uncover it publicly, to smoke it out and in so doing raise the political price that the regime pays for deploying this strategy\"\nIn other words, not to allow it to happen under cover, under the - ...[indistinct] to appear to be Nkatha or faction fighting or White on Black violence but to smoke it out and to show it for what it is, namely a fairly cynical strategy deployed by the regime at the time.  \n\tThat was his attitude and that was why precisely he was not rushing off to arm himself or to launch an army, he was deeply committed and understood - he had the intelligence to understand that the kind of provocation that your applicants sought to unleash, was precisely to fall into the hands of those who didn't want to see a non-racial democracy in our country - he had the intelligence to  understand that.",

When the ANC and it's alliance suspended the armed struggle, we suspended the armed struggle, there was not circumspection about that, we were clear, we were suspending it.  \n\tThere was no confusion, there was no rhetoric which gave our followers - you know, a nudge and wink that they might be at liberty to do what they like and that they could then claim that they were under some illusion that they'd been ordered to do so by Chris Hani or whosoever.  \n\tSo, yes, we were circumspect, yes, we were uncertain about our safety, yes, we were not sure if the negotiations would produce peace but as we changed our policy in regard - for instance to violence, we said it very clearly and we committed ourselves as a leadership to that.\n\tWhen we were engaged in armed struggle, we were clear that we were engaged in armed struggle and we assumed full political responsibility for that, so if in this area of circumspection which you are trying to introduce into the question, you're trying to fudge a number of different things then I'd advise you not to because I'm very clear in my own mind what our attitude ..[inaudible]  \n\tWe were circumspect about - we were concerned about people who were in the underground who might be arrested, our circumspection proved correct.
