<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Are we ready, gentlemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>	Mr Chairman, it is 27th February 1997, continuation in the matter, Mr Chairman, as agreed </p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>yesterday that we will first start with the evidence or questioning of General van der Merwe, he is herein </p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>present Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>GENERAL JOHAN VAN DER MERWE:   (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>JUDGE MALL:  You gave evidence in this matter on a previous occasion and at the request of counsel, </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>further questioning of you was reserved and, you are here this morning to make yourself available to deal </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>with such questions as are relevant that are going to be put to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  I am at your disposal Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Mr Currin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR CURRIN:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.	General van der Merwe, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>will recall that during your evidence-in-chief a lot was said about so-called preemptive attacks, and these I </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>am referring particularly to the unlawful preemptive attacks that have been referred to by the applicants in </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>this particular matter. Would you please clarify for us what the SAP policy was in regard to preemptive </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>attacks by the security forces and if you are in a position to do so, whether you can tell us what the </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>government policy was with regard to preemptive attacks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  I would just like to differentiate, Mr Chairman, between the internal and external </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>activities. </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>MR CURRIN	233	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>Firstly, as far as internal activities are concerned there was no policy either from the side of the government </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>or from the side of the police as far as preemptive attacks are concerned. Incidents which did occur, </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>occurred on an ad hoc basis against the background which I attempted to sketch to you, honourable </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>Chairman, taking into consideration all the facts which were relevant and all the considerations which </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>members had to operate under the circumstances. </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>	As far as external activities were concerned there was also no policy. The government as far as </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>external activities were considered did this in terms of the international law and with the determined </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>circumstances at hand which had to be considered at that point. There was a general approach that we, as </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>far as threats in neighbouring countries were concerned, would act in order to combat potential threats and </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>where necessary persons who according to our information were ready to come into the country to come </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>and kill anyone, to commit any form of terrorism to eliminate such persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>MR CURRIN:  It would seem that from the evidence submitted by the applicants a perception existed in </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>their minds that there was a policy and a general instruction and a general authorisation to undertake </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>unlawful preemptive action. Do you have anything to say about that perception?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Yes, Honourable Chairman.  If a person bears in mind that for all practical purposes </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>we find ourselves in a war situation where members of particularly the South African Police, but the </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>Defence Force in general, were exposed to attacks and organisations such as the ANC policies were that </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>where they got the opportunity to shoot these persons or whichever other way they could, they could find to </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>eliminate these people. </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>MR CURRIN	234	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>	Secondly, if you should look at certain ad hoc incidents where there was government permission </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>granted, in other cases where with the permission of higher authorities certain acts were performed or not </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>necessarily under the circumstances which prevailed at the time were not illegal, but at the time which is </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>now the question of amnesty, but I think to the ordinary person who had the privilege to be involved in </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>these discussions at a higher level and was exposed to political speeches and who had authority and who </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>created the impression that the enemy should be eliminated at all costs, it is possible that such an </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>impression could have been created.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>MR CURRIN:   Would that include divisional commissioners, for example we have heard from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>previous divisional commissioner of the Northern Transvaal that that was his perception, is he also a </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>"gewone man"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Yes, these are persons who were not necessarily directly involved in the State </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>Security Council and the different committees of the State Security Council and who at that level always </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>assumed how these things should be approached.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>MR CURRIN:  Are you then saying that that perception which existed in the minds of very, very senior </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>police officers, from your view was both understandable and justifiable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  In the extraordinary circumstances which prevailed your Honourable Chairman, I say </p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>MR CURRIN:  Would you agree that the government, certainly the cabinet, the relevant Ministers played a </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>significant role in contributing towards that perception by not making strong statements against some of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>things which were in fact happening, and by some of the speeches which were made </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>MR CURRIN	235	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>on television, radio etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>GEN. V/D MERWE:  Honourable Chairman, it is very difficult to generalise.  You know when one applies </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>such a point of view to the whole government it is not necessarily applicable to all the members, but in </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>certain instances, the way I saw the circumstances, I would say yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>MR CURRIN:  If that is the case, and here we are talking about the perception to commit unlawful </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>preemptive assaults, attacks, would you agree with me that in contributing towards that perception or that </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>contribution towards that perception would be tantamount to implied authority?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Honourable Chairman, I think that would be taking it a bit too far. One has to bear in </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>mind that persons who made these utterances and who occasionally were involved in certain incidents from </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>the side of the government, also saw it in the light that these particular incidents and I do not think it would </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>be appropriate or it would be fair to the previous government to generalise and to say that from their side </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>there was an indifferent approach and in that manner there was permission granted for these type of acts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>MR CURRIN:  Are you therefore saying, do I understand you to be saying then, that in spite of the fact that </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>the perception was there and was partially as result of omissions or actions by government, when such </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>unlawful preemptive acts were committed by security force members, there was no authority to commit </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>them, either express or implied?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  What I mean by that is that the previous government chose to grant permission </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>silently without saying anything but if you are looking at the members who were </p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>MR CURRIN	236	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>involved and asking what their perception was, you would say that they obviously believed that they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>acting in the interests of the previous government. I do not think that one could put the two on the exact </p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>same footing or have the same approach.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>MR CURRIN:  The difficulty I am grappling with and ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>JUDGE MALL:   When you say that the government gave permission silently, are you saying that after the </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>event the government approved of what was done, is that what you are tying to convey?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>GEN. V/D MERWE:  No, Mr Chairman.  What I would like to concede here is that as a result of </p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>statements which were made by members of the previous regime as result of certain limited incidents, </p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>where members of the previous regime were involved, which are regarded as illegal under the present </p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>circumstances and which amnesty is being applied for, to the ordinary man and when I refer to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>"ordinary man" I am referring to people who were not directly involved, a perception could have evolved </p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>that the act which he committed bore the approval of the government, but not necessarily that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>government in some way or another came to know about it and silently approved of it or omitted, </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>deliberately omitted, to take any steps and in that way identified with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  And if the government or a member of the government gives, awards a medal for an </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>incident or involvement in an incident, would you consider that to be approval?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  As far as I know, Honourable Chairman, it applies to external activities which I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>aware of, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>MR CURRIN	236	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>goes without saying where, even where the previous government in some or other way was aware of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>actual circumstances it was not necessarily true that they approved of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>MR CURRIN:  I am still not absolutely sure of the answer to this question which I understand is a difficult </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>one because there was no policy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Well, are you merely dealing with perceptions, perceptions in whose mind?   In the mind </p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>of the perpetrators or in the mind of the victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>MR CURRIN:  Well, I am trying to establish whether or not there was authority, either implied or </p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>expressed in regard to some of the Acts which were committed and I am having specific reference to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>provisions of the Act. One of the factors obviously which will be taken into consideration by your </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>Committee, Mr Chairman, is the question of authority, and clearly on behalf of the victims we need to </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>know whether the acts which were committed against the victims for whom we appear, did have the </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>authority.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Now I understand that I am not clear in my mind whether your questions relate to </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>perceptions that may be in the minds of victims that so and so had authority or did not have authority.  Or </p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>perceptions in the minds of the perpetrators who believe that they may have had authority. If you clear that </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>up maybe we will make progress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>MR CURRIN:  Yes, sure, okay.  We are referring to the perceptions in the minds of the applicants, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>perpetrators.  What we are trying to gather here, what I am trying to get on behalf of the victims is - and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>will deal specifically with the various cases in a short while, where a - let's take for example one particular </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>case, Sergeant </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>MR CURRIN	237	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>Mutasi who was killed by security policemen as well as his wife, on information which was given to them </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>that he was giving information to the ANC. They took it upon themselves to murder, to kill him and his </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>wife. Can it be said in a situation like that, which is clearly a preemptive attack, preemptive unlawful </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>killing that they had authorisation to do that, and that you as the - well at that stage I think you were the </p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>Commissioner at that stage, it was in 1989 or no, you were the Deputy Commissioner at that stage, whether </p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>you in fact at least by implication authorised an act of that nature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, I am sorry, may I come in here. The question was phrased by Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>Currin from a specific point of view, evidence has not been lead in that matter.  And I want to state here on </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>record that the applicants' version of the facts of what happened there differs slightly from what Mr Currin </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>stated to the General.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>JUDGE MALL:  I think you may formulate a question differently.  So the evidence relating to Mutasi has </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>not yet been led and he may or may not be aware of that specific instance. Now you might be asking him </p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>questions on matters ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>MR CURRIN:  I understand. Let's look for example then at the matter of the Nietverdiend attack on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>vehicle in which there were a number of young ANC activists. They were led to believe that they were to </p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>be taken out for training. In a way, according to the evidence, one could say that a trap was set for </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>them.They gathered at a house, they were enticed into a kombi, into a vehicle, and they were driven out </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>towards the border and in Bophuthatswana they were killed preemptively, without having actually yet done </p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>anything, </p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>MR CURRIN	238	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>committed any acts of violence. Could one say that they did that with the authorisation of the South African </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>Police force and the government of the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Chairman, once again, and I have attempted to explain it as such, it depends on what </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>their perceptions were, in the mind of the person who was involved.  Against the background of all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>circumstances which prevailed at the time certain Acts which did take place with the permission of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>government and also certain utterances which may have been made by members of the previous regime. I </p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>would like to answer that by saying that if a person was to judge it objectively, then it definitely did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>bear that approval.  If one was to look at it subjectively from the point of view of the person who </p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>committed the act, my opinion would be that that person believed that in the light of other similar instances </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>could be regarded in a similar light that he was still busy acting within the permission, so there was implied </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>permission granted although there was not expressed permission granted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>MR CURRIN:   Surely the question of authority, even if it is implied authority or ...(indistinct) authority, </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>doesn't depend on the mind of the perpetrator, doesn't it depend on the mind of the principle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Yes under normal circumstances.  Here we were in a combat situation. I do not think </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>that one could consider dealings which happened under those circumstances as compared to what happened </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>under normal circumstances and also the reaction of persons under normal circumstances.  But you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>correct, under normal circumstances it would obviously have been, it would have been like that, but here </p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>were dealing with abnormal circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>MR CURRIN	238	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   You talk about abnormal circumstances, are these what you have set out in your </p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>submissions in paragraph 18, page 22?  You refer to the prevailing circumstances, the lowering of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>morale of the community and the security forces and the belief that the enemy had to be destroyed no </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>matter what, and that this was aggravated to a great extent by speeches and pronouncements made by </p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>certain people and the police who were emotionally involved, or the - sorry it's not - the security forces who </p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>were emotionally involved were just not able to distinguish between what was normally justifiable and </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>what was not.  That is the position you are talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  That is correct, Mr Chairman. Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>MR CURRIN:  I understand your evidence then to be that to the extent that there may have been implied </p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>authority, depending on the circumstances, there was certainly no general authority giving the security </p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>police carte blanche to go out and to kill and to commit unlawful Acts according to a whim or a feeling at a </p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>particular time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  General, if a member of the previous regime were to say make a public statement to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>affect that the movements, let's say the - should eliminate the ANC or PAC, what did you understand by </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>that and what do you think the perception would be of ordinary members of the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman, I myself was in a fortunate position where I had a liaison with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>members of the previous regime in the structures which determined the various actions, so I would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>had a better understanding, but I have no doubt in my mind that the ordinary person, and PRETORIA </p>

<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>MR CURRIN	239	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>by this I am referring to the lay-person who was not involved in this situation by that have understood that </p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>action should be taken at all costs to combat illegal or violent acts on the regime, on the government of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>MR CURRIN:  What I am trying to now understand and maybe you can help me General, is in a way you </p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>are saying that one has to take into consideration the subjective mind of the policemen at the time, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>perpetrator, the circumstances that prevailed, what had been said by politicians at around about that time, </p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>and weigh up his actions in that context, there are many uncertainties around that as far as I am concerned.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>Were there any implied guidelines, any criteria that you can possibly refer to which would help us to </p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>understand when a security policeman in that situation is going beyond implied authority that there may </p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>have been. Is there anything that you can help us to identify those sorts of guidelines that you think would </p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>have been there by implication?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman, definitely not. Over and above saying to you that in all circumstances </p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>one was to consider what the exceptional approach would be of a certain member and what made him act </p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>like that because as I said to you there was no policy.  There was never any form of permission granted.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>All I was trying to sketch to you was the factors which lead members to believe that certain things which </p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>they did were in the interests of the structure of which they were serving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>MR CURRIN:  I am going to move off that theme now and go onto another one.	The unlawful attacks </p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>that I have been referring to, very often after having committed an attack of that nature, we have heard </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>about bombings of - petrol </p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>MR CURRIN	240	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>bombings of houses which were committed by the security police and then the impression was created that </p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>that attack was actually committed by the African National Congress or another liberation movement, was </p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>it government policy or police policy to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Definitely not, Mr Chairman.  As I have already explained there was no policy from </p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>the police or the government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>MR CURRIN:  Not in regard to the attack but in regard to creating the impression that in fact it was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>ANC that committed that particular attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Definitely not, Mr Chairman, because in order to do that would have meant that </p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>necessarily that the government or the authority had to have had knowledge of how those acts were to have </p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>taken place and that was not the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>MR CURRIN:  I assume there is no record or information anywhere which would help us to know how </p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>many of those attacks which were laid at the door of the liberation movement were actually committed by </p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>the security forces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman, I think as the duties of this Committee proceed it would indeed be a </p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>very good version.  There are also attempts being made on our part to assist this Committee in that regard </p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>and I think that as soon as it has been completed that there will be a very good indication to that affect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  General, just to try and clear up this point. You say that there was no such policy but </p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>that you personally were involved in the Zero Handgrenade attacks. How do you explain your action if it </p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>was not with the permission or under which circumstances would you be able to PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>MR CURRIN	240	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>justify that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman here we spoke generally about general policy. I initially said that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>were certain acts which took place with the permission of the previous regime and that those very acts </p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>contributed to the perception which existed in the minds of the workers with regards to such acts, but in </p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>each case where there was such a doing we took all circumstances into consideration and we tried to </p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>explain it as fully as possible to you why we did it that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>MR CURRIN:  Following up from that question, in your evidence, I think you referred to two incidents of </p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>which you are aware, one is the Zero Handgrenade attack and the other was the attack on Zozo house, </p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>which were both preemptive, unlawful attacks, as we are referring to them at the moment, are those the </p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>only two specific cases of which you have knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  No, Mr Chairman, the only reason why I mentioned these two incidents to this </p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>Committee was to give you a background around the perceptions which existed and to shed more light on </p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>that, those are not the only two incidents there are more incidents in which I was involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>MR CURRIN:  And those other matters in which you were involved, and I don't want to get into this </p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>because I know that you have yourself brought an amnesty application, and in fairness I appreciate that one </p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>would want to, you would want to deal with your own amnesty application in your own time, but having </p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>said that, may I assume that you will be referring to those other incidents when you bring your own </p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>MR CURRIN	241	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>MR CURRIN:  If the Committee would - I am not going to ask any more questions about that.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>	I would now like us to talk about the State Security Council and we would like as detailed </p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>information as possible from you, on the workings of the State Security council, how it featured politically </p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>and with regard to power and in regard to instructions and the whole question of instructions and line of </p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>command from, for example, if one were to go down from a Divisional Commissioner to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>Commissioner to the Minister and then to the State Security Council, how that line of command actually </p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>functioned and possibly fill us in on that?  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Honourable Chairman, I am going to try my best but I would like to tell you from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>word go that the State Security Council with all its structures formed the concept of M-</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>dealings(?)(indelings)? and I am going to try and give it to you as briefly as possible where I was involved. </p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>I might say to you that it may not be complete and it may not be completely correct because from time to </p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>time there were many changes made to the structure, but to the best of my ability I will attempt to assist </p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  General, you refer to M-dealings (indelings)? to dissertations, could you just refer to an </p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>authority in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, perhaps I can help you there, I am in possession of Prof van der </p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>Merwe's Doctorate thesis which is a document of approximately 300 pages when I was of the opinion that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>together with - I would deal with it with Captain van Jaarsveld and I have already given it to him and if the </p>

<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>"organogram" setting out the structures.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairman, we have various organograms in respect of various phases of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>period, so we are compiling that information, we will make it available to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Thank you very much and I say that because it might avoid the necessity of calling a host </p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>of other witnesses on that matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, that is why it was important to call Captain van Jaarsveld, he will be able to give </p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a>evidence about that whole issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Honourable Chairman, I am going to explain the dealings of the State Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>Council before 1990 because after 1990 there were certain changes and if you are interested in that, those </p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>were merely technical changes, I might be able to inform you there as well. </p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>	Before 1990 the State Security Council was self-existent out of these the State President, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>Minister of Defence, the Minister previously of Police and thereafter of Law and Order, Minister of Justice, </p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>Minister of Foreign Affairs and occasionally the Minister of Finance and the Minister of State Expenditure </p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>would be there as the State President deemed necessary. </p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  That was a bit fast as my colleague indicated, were there five permanent members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  There was the State President, the Minister of Defence, Minister of Law and Order, </p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>previously the Minister of Police, the Minister of Justice and the Minister PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>MR CURRIN	242	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>of Foreign Affairs, they were permanent members and occasionally the Minister of Constitutional </p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a>Development, I don't know if he became a permanent member but he and the Minister of Finance </p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>eventually were there and other members according to who the State President deemed necessary and also </p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>the heads of the different departments. </p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>	The State Security Council in turn had a Secretariat.  This Secretariat had various committees and </p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a>I think the committees whose dealings would be of interest to you and in whose dealings I would go into at </p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>length would be the Strategic Committee which dealt with various incidents with regard to certain matters.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>Then the Security Council had another committee, a Management Committee at divisional level where the </p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>heads of the departments and heads of the Defence Force served. I would say the Divisional Heads and </p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>other persons and it was further divided into branches with management centres where other members </p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>served at a lower level. </p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>	The State Security Council itself determined policy as far as defence was concerned, took </p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>decisions which were of National interest, which by way of the ministers involved and various departments </p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>would be executed via those departments. The Executive - the system was under a Minister who also </p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>reported directly to the Council from time to time and they served in a purely coordinational function.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>There were also various departments who contributed to the security situation and in that way brought them </p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>together and planned these things together and also would coordinate actions which were to take place.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>But all instructions were done via the departments in their own systems. As far as the joint management </p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>committee there was no authority to issue </p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>MR CURRIN	243	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>instructions, so it was merely coordinational.  And when it came to policy and the execution of policy the </p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>State Security Council, in the light of information which was received from all the other committees, would </p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>determine the instruction and the policy and the department heads in their turn would execute these </p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>instructions through the departments. </p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>	There was also the Coordinating Information Committee. The chairperson was also a permanent </p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>member of the State Security Council.  Previously it was Dr Neil Barnard and the coordinator was - the </p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>coordinators consisted of the various of the heads of the various information committees which in those </p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>days were the National Intelligence and Military Intelligence and Foreign Affairs who also had an </p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>informatory role, and in their turn they would also contribute to what was submitted to the State Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>Council to consider and also determine policy and decide which steps should be taken in the interest of </p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>National Security.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>MR CURRIN:  When you talk about taking a decision on policy and steps that need to be taken in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a>interests of State Security, are you referring to, for example, a decision as to whether the emergency </p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>regulations should be extended, is it that type of a policy decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Ja, that is correct, Mr Chairman. Inter alia it included other aspects such as when </p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>there was a specific area where there was unrest and it could overflow into other areas and cause a </p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a>nationwide unrest situation, then it would be such a situation where there had to be decisions taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>MR CURRIN:  Now, that's a general decision. What about specific issues?   We have heard evidence, for </p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>example, that Trivets which has been referred to fairly extensively, would PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>MR CURRIN	244	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>have discussions they would identify targets, they would then implement action against a particular target, </p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>but that those decisions to implement were done with the knowledge of the State Security Council because </p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>there was a referral upwards through the Divisional Commissioner, through the Commissioner to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>Minister and then to the State Security Council, could you tell us whether that is in fact how it operated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman, I have already, in my evidence- in-chief testified about Trivets.  It was </p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>a Committee which was under the control of the Coordinating Information Committee and Trivets duty, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>would like to repeat that for your information, Trivets duty was, inter alia, to identify targets that were </p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a>threatening in surrounding areas and also work out ways of combatting such threats, and also where </p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>necessary cross-border operations and necessary eliminations.   And also within the country identify </p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>potential threatening targets. I never understood it otherwise and I never received any other information but </p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>thereafter within the law to combat such threat. Trivets did not report to the State Security Council directly </p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>but by way of the Coordinating Information Committee, and the only incidents which I am aware about </p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a>where information was given by Trivets and where a decision was taken by the State Security Council was </p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>about cross-border operations.  But there were no other incidents which I can just remember off-hand </p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>where the State Security Council, in the light of information which Trivets made available to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>coordinating Information Committee, took a decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>MR CURRIN:  And you are quite categorical when you say that any target identified within the borders of </p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a>South Africa by </p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>

<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>Trivets the only authority in regard to such a target would have been to act lawfully against such a target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  That is correct, Mr Chairman, but at previous occasion I emphasised that due to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a>fact that Trevits had to identify potential threats outside the country and by means of cross-border </p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>operations and act against persons who were potential threats, it led to the confused or the misperception </p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>that targets within the country were regarded in the same category as members outside the country and in </p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a>the past few months we encountered such perceptions.  But in being, it was never the intention of Trevits </p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a>and indeed Trevits never operated in that manner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a>MR CURRIN:  If one takes for example the Nyanda attack which you are aware of, it is one of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>applications which has been submitted, the killing of Zwele Nyanda and Keith McFadden, an attack in </p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>Swaziland, would that attack have been discussed at the level of the State Security Council before it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>implemented?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman, it was possible but I do not know about it. I, myself cannot comment </p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a>on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>MR CURRIN:  So not all attacks that were exercised outside of the borders of the country would </p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>necessarily have been discussed on the level of the State Security Council?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Definitely not. There were acts committed without the necessary involvement or </p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a>without having approached the Security Council first, that was our approach to this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>MR CURRIN:  We also heard evidence and you have testified to this and I just would like to get clarity </p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>because I don't fully understand the evidence which you gave in-chief as to </p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a>MR CURRIN	245	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>your position regarding joint projects between the SAP and the South African Defence Force. Was there an </p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>official policy in regard to joint security projects, joint action to be taken by the SAP and the SADF or </p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>wasn't there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman, It is actually a broad understanding.  Let me say, our cooperation with </p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>the Defence Force firstly took place where the coordination at management level and where certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>instances had to be decided upon where the Defence Force and the police were jointly going to work </p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>together. I think you are referring to specific project.  There was no policy as far as specific projects were </p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>concerned but we operated on an ad hoc basis especially with other countries, but there was a policy in </p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>general that we would act jointly and the general policy was that each force acts of its own accord, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a>where it was on an ad hoc basis, they would act jointly. But there was no approach that that was the general </p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>practice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a>MR CURRIN:  The last question which I would like to put to you for the victims, the victims want to know </p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a>whether the top structures, the State President, the State Security Council, Ministers involved in police </p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>affairs in your instance, had knowledge and participated in giving instructions in matters where their loved </p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a>ones were killed. Now, I haven't been able to get that answer from you because we have only been able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>speak in general terms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Is the question related to whether specific Cabinet Ministers gave instructions to take part </p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a>in a specific act at a given time, is that what you are really saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>MR CURRIN:  That is what I am trying to establish, we haven't been able to get because of the generality </p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a>of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>MR CURRIN	246	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a>evidence which has been given, which I appreciate due to the circumstances at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a>JUDGE MALL:  I understand, but that is what you are really trying to get now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>MR CURRIN:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>JUDGE MALL:   The role of each, not each but Cabinet Ministers who were on the State Security Council </p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a>for example?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>MR CURRIN:  Precisely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>MR CURRIN:  Was the Minister of Law and Order, for example, knowledgeable of acts that were being </p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>committed by the Security Police?  Was the State President aware of acts of violence which were being </p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>committed, unlawful killings that were committed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a>JUDGE MALL:  No, not just was aware, it is not a question of who was aware, you are really interested in </p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>whether he authorised?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>MR CURRIN:  Well, yes, either expressly or by implication if he was aware and they took no action or </p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>they didn't reprimand, well then there would be at least implied authorisation. I understand that there was, </p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>from the evidence, that there couldn't have been expressed authorisation, that is my understanding of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>evidence. Could we say that there was at least implied authorisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman, once again I would like to emphasise I said apart from specific </p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>incidents I have already testified about the Zero Handgrenade attack where I made a recommendation </p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a>which was approved by Minister Le Grange and in other words he was aware of that. It is very difficult for </p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>me to speak about the other incidents because </p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>MR CURRIN	247	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>I cannot testify that the Ministers were involved or were aware of that, but I, myself did not inform them </p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a>and I am aware if they knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>MR CURRIN:  I want to ask you then just in regard to the matters where I am appearing on behalf of </p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>victims whether you know as you do with the Zero Handgrenade as to whether or not there was such </p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>information. The Ribiero killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  I do not have any knowledge. I also do not have any knowledge and I will tell you if </p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>I do, I do not have any knowledge whatsoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>MR CURRIN:  There was, we have already heard the matter involving brutal torture, assault and then </p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a>killing of three activists, Maake, Makupe and Sefolo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  I don't have no knowledge about that whatsoever, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>MR CURRIN:  Geoffrey Sibaya ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Sorry, Mr Currin I think the point which Mr Visser was trying to make is that, and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>have that difficulty, you've mentioned the Ribiero incident, you've made another one and the witness again </p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>says "I have no knowledge", I don't know what it is that he doesn't know.  I don't know whether the witness </p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>is saying he has no knowledge or whether he is saying in terms of the long introduction that you made </p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>before you came to specific incidents, whether the witness is saying "I don't know that the Minister or the </p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a>President knew"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a>MR CURRIN:  I think that is the question and I think that is what he is saying, that ...(intervention) </p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  It applies to both Mr Chairman. I don't know and I don't know if any of the Ministers </p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a>knew of it. Otherwise I would confirm it as such and I was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a>MR CURRIN	247	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a>personally involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a>MR CURRIN:  The focus of the question is whether there was the knowledge of the instruction going all </p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>the way up, whether he knows whether there was such knowledge, as for example, with the Zero </p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a>Handgrenade case, where he knows that there was an instruction from the Commissioner and the Minister </p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a>knew. I am trying to establish whether that knowledge existed in any of these case, in his mind. Is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a>clear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  What was the second one you mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a>MR CURRIN:  The second one I mentioned was Maake, Makupe and Sefolo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  There wasn't one between Ribiero and that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a>MR CURRIN:  No. And then Geoffrey Sibiya?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  I don't know about it Mr Chairman, I don't even know if the Ministers or anyone else </p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a>knew about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a>MR CURRIN:  The Nietverdiend matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  No knowledge, Mr Chairman. I don't have any information with regard to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a>MR CURRIN:  The KwaNdebele Nine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  No information, I don't know whether the Ministers know, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a>MR CURRIN:  And the killing of Sergeant Mutasi and his wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  No information, I don't know whether the Ministers know, knew anything about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR CURRIN</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, before I go on with re-examination may I be afforded an opportunity </p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a>and before Mr Visser goes on with his questions, may I be afforded an opportunity for a short adjournment </p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a>if it would please you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a>JUDGE MALL:  We will grant you that opportunity - do you </p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a>248	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>want that just now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairman, there are a few things I want to discuss with Mr Visser which I </p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>haven't had the opportunity this morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>MR VISSER:  Mr Chairman, I have only got one question which I wish to put to General van der Merwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a>MR VISSER:  Perhaps it may be convenient for me to do so straight away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes, please do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a>MR VISSER:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:	General, you have been referred to public comments or </p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a>speeches which would have been made by high officials in the government.  My question to you with </p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a>reference to that is simply this. You as Commissioner of Police was told at a political platform - what you </p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>were told at a political platform in a political speech was that how you understood your instructions or were </p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a>your instructions relayed to you in a different manner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman, obviously utterances made at a political platform as far as we, our </p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a>duty arrangements were concerned, did not impact on that but I think it was merely important to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a>perceptions of the persons who heard that, but it had no influence in the course of our duties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a>MR VISSER:  And in your mind it also created no policy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  No, not as far as we were concerned. As I said I was in the fortunate position where I </p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a>was in direct liaison with the policy-makers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a>JUDGE MALL:  We will take a short adjournment at this stage, PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a>249	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a>you will call us as soon as you are ready.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, it will be short, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a>COMMISSION ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Mr Mpshe, are there any questions you would like to put.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a>NO EXAMINATION BY ADV MPSHE:  No, Mr Chairman, there are no questions from me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  You have been asked about what knowledge the Ministers or the State Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a>Council may have had of incidents that occurred, you said they wouldn't have had, as I understand, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>there were certain incidents that I think we all knew of that occurred in Lesotho, in Botswana and Maputo, </p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a>where it was accepted by everybody that the South African Armed Forces had been involved, now I take it </p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a>those would have been discussed by the State Security Council?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Yes, that is correct, with cross-border attacks most of them were discussed by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a>State Security Council and approved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a>JUDGE MALL:   Decisions taken by the State Security Council, you have described how they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a>implemented by a Committee, a sub-Committee would implement its decisions, instructions to members of </p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a>the Security Force or to the Armed Force, who would give those instructions, Security Council decisions </p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a>instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  It would have been by the departmental heads of each department after having being </p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a>conveyed to the members of his department, there were no other channels which were followed. The </p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a>decisions taken by the State Security Council were by the department head and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a>MR CURRIN	250	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a>Minister involved, would be dealt with by the department and executed and where it affected other </p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a>departments and other Ministers, it would be conveyed by the State Security Council to the Minister </p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a>involved. The Committees had no authority over and above the State Security Council itself to issue any </p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a>instructions to any department or as far as it goes to act without or beyond the authorised guidelines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a>JUDGE MALL:  What would the role of the State President be in conveying instructions to anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman, the State President was the Chairman of the State Security Council, </p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a>but it was obvious where there were cases where the State President, during a visit or during a discussions </p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a>went beyond the ambient of the State Security Council, would issue certain instructions to persons present </p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a>there. The State President himself had the authority to instruct any Minister and that Minister in turn would </p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a>instruct the departments to execute such instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a>JUDGE MALL:  While you were Commissioner what was the Cabinet position of Mr Roelf Meyer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman, if I remember correctly he was first the Deputy Minister of </p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a>Constitutional Development and then he became the Minister. Since 1990 of course he also served on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a>State Security Council.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Did you say that he was also Minister of Defence at some stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  He could have been Acting Minister, but I do not think that he was actually Minister. </p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a>He was Chairman of the GVS system, but you could be right, but I cannot confirm that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a>JUDGE MALL:  What system was it that you were talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Please repeat the question?</p>

<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Of what system?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:   The General Management System.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  General, I would just like to clear up several aspects on the report about which you </p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a>testified. You make mention of incidents where the police were victims and you also mention that in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a>years, in those years, for a period of six years from 1973 to 1979 there were 76 to 90, 270 cases and in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a>years 1991 and 1992, 385 cases. That was after negotiations had begun. In that year the ANC was </p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a>unbanned. To what do you attribute this escalation of attacks on police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman, we looked at several possibilities and one factor which played a very </p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a>important role was that the unrest situation in the country deteriorated drastically due to the fact that </p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a>different political parties had begun to form their power bases and this process led to clashes between </p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a>political parties and their supporters and that was what gave rise to escalating violence countrywide and </p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a>this process, in this process unfortunately, all the political parties and mainly the Black political parties took </p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a>a stance at the time because the police tried to remain neutral at the time, that the police were still the other </p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a>ones friend and the police became a target and because at the time we were from different political parties, </p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a>that is why the death rate and the murders of policemen, as far as we could determine, escalated like that. </p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a>The unrest situation also contributed to that because people moved around much easier under those </p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a>circumstances and they killed much more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  General, in that time you were also Commissioner of Police, if I remember correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a>ADV DE JAGER	251	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  That is correct, from January 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   And there was also something you mentioned in your report, an incident where 505 </p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a>persons were killed by the necklace method. Were the police - and once again in how many incidents were </p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a>they successful in tracing the perpetrators in such cases and prosecuting them or what was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  There was a very limited amount of incidents due to the fact the intimidation factor </p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a>played a great role. There simply wasn't anyone that was prepared to come forward under those </p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a>circumstances and testify against persons who were involved in necklacing. We considered witness </p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a>protection programmes, but at that stage it was utterly impossible to really protect witnesses due to the fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a>that they - the exceptional situation which existed at the time, so we did not achieve much success in </p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a>tracing those offenders. </p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  In some of these cases it was testified that people were no longer brought to a Court of </p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a>Law to be prosecuted, what was the reason for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman, because especially in Black townships the justice system for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a>persons living there it created problems. The fact that someone was arrested and shortly thereafter was set </p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a>free on bail led to many of the persons around that regarding it as nothing, sending a message out to these </p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a>persons that he was being exposed to the danger which existed yesterday and the day before and which he </p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a>was hoping would have been eliminated by the arrest of this person. Also because the courts brought </p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a>themselves to a standstill and it was very drastic and I think in many cases under those circumstances one </p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a>could say that it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a>ADV DE JAGER	252	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a>more practical to act according to the opinion that justice should prevail and it also contributed to the fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a>that our justice system which is based as you very well know - all the requirements of the criminal </p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>procedure and what goes with that were not accepted very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Of course the picture that you have been giving in answer to the questions by </p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a>Advocate de Jager becomes even more complicated when one has to take into account the fact that the so-</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a>called third force also came into the picture, played a major role with regards to the - to all these problems </p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a>that you have been describing.  One cannot overlook that fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Yes, Mr Chairman, the third force activity is a general term which is used with </p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a>regard to a specific incident which took place, although I would agree with you that it could also have </p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a>played a role.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>JUDGE MALL:  (...indistinct) re-examination, but I am not asking you to lead fresh evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a>RE-EXAMINATION BY ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairman, I am not going to lead fresh evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Excuse me please, I would like to ask one more question which is bothering me.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a>When you say, and I think in your response you said that you did not know about it the Minister did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a>know about it as far as you know. There were incidents, there was an incident let's take for example, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a>Nietverdiend incident, how many persons died there, was it nine due to a bomb explosion? Surely </p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a>something like that was investigated by the police and it should have been reported back to the heads of </p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a>department, and also what the results of such an investigation were and who committed the offence or </p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a>whatever? Let us assume that they knew </p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a>ADV DE JAGER	253	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a>nothing about it beforehand, but you, as Commissioner, surely came to know about it thereafter and surely </p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a>you would have reported that to the Minister?  What steps were taken in such cases where it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a>determined, I don't know if you were able to determine how it happened, but if facts came to light as we </p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a>know was it repudiated in the Press or what was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman, I am not aware of any of these cases where the investigation or the </p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a>reports which were submitted thereafter reflected the circumstances as is coming to light now.  But at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a>time what was investigated was the deed without the high authorities which received the reports knowing </p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a>who was involved.  In other words we would have dealt with it like any other incident of that nature and </p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a>there were many incidents of that nature. As we know in our country, in one year 16 to 17 000 persons </p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a>would be murdered, so violence in that regard was a common occurrence and it would have been dealt with </p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a>as such. If you were asking me whether there were specific incidents where we came to know about the </p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a>details of the circumstances, surely in the amnesty applications which would come before you there will be </p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a>such incidents but these incidents which are under discussion here as far as I know are not, were not dealt </p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a>with in that manner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Is it fair to say that this particular incident, Nietverdiend, was never itself reported to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a>State Security Council?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Quite correct, your Worship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a>JUDGE MALL:  And like that other single or specific incidents themselves would not reach the ears of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a>State Security Council, is that what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a>JUDGE MALL	253	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  That is quite correct, Your Worship, unless there were exceptional circumstances, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a>the normal type of cases wouldn't have been reported to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Now then, who is the highest authority to whom such a report would be made, for </p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a>example, this Nietverdiend incident? </p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman, it would have depended on the circumstances.  In most cases such </p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a>information would have been reported to the head of a division that would depend on the kind of act that </p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a>was reported, then that report would have become part of the general criminality reports and we have </p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a>submitted that to the Minister from time to time for his attention. We have also from him onwards went to </p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a>the Cabinet but we would never have individually reported these cases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Just one further question regarding the cross-border action, did this answer apply to </p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a>Botswana actions as well, Transkei as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Yes, in the case of Transkei, you would recall the case where Mr de Klerk himself </p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a>gave permission against APLA Forces, you recall their people being shot at that occasion, but not all cases </p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a>were approved by the State Security Council, but in some cases cross-border raids were approved by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a>State Security Council.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Just to clear this up, do I understand you to be saying that with regard to Transkei, </p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a>Bophuthatswana or for that matter Venda for example or Ciskei, the approach was that they were treated as </p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a>much foreign as Swaziland, Lesotho, Uganda etc. I just want to clear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Insofar as the State Security Council is concerned, yes Your Worship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE	254	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Yes, and to that extent therefore the policy with regards to identification of targets, </p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a>elimination etc. inside Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Venda and the like ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Would have been the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  It would have been the same?</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  It would have been the same, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Was there a permanent Coordinating Committee between the South African Police and </p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a>the South African Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Yes, Chairman, it was the intervention of the joint management system done at all </p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a>levels countrywide but of course there was also the intervention of the Coordinating Information </p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a>Committee.  As far as information was concerned we liaised with each other and also with the various </p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a>working committees of the State Security Council.  So on a daily basis between the different, at different </p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a>levels there were times when the police and the defence force liaised with each other and planned the </p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a>workings were coordinated jointly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Thank you.  Yes, Mr du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a>RE-EXAMINATION BY ADV DU PLESSIS: (cont) Thank you, Mr Chairman.	General you just gave </p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a>evidence with regards to the Security Acts and Legislation and the effectiveness of it. The evidence of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a>applicants was that in certain instances they had to act against activists in the manner in which they did </p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a>outside of the parameters of the normal justice system due to the fact that the system, the Security System </p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a>itself, was not effective in combatting the liberation movement of the ANC and other movements. Would </p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a>you say that that was a contributing factor to the perception of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	255	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a>applicants and Brigadier Cronje who was the Commanding Officer and also other applicants in certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a>instances that due to the fact that the Act itself was not affective enough that it was justified to act beyond </p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a>the parameters of the law?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  I have no doubt, Mr Chairman, that our justice system and the circumstances in </p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a>which we found ourselves which was a combat situation for all practical purposes was of such a nature that </p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a>one could not deal with it effectively.  In my opinion if it was not for political gain, the riot actions if I </p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a>could put it that way, would be to declare a cross-justice system which would have been detrimental to our </p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a>country.  But if you look at the situation which we had dealt with, to a limited extent you could refer to it as </p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a>a "civilian war" and the circumstances surrounding that were not enough to combat it effectively and that is </p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a>one of the reasons why at the end of 1989, Mr de Klerk decided to head in a new direction because there </p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a>was no other way to deal with the situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you General.  You testified with regard to reporting of certain incidents, as I </p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a>understand your evidence you said that in most instances the - an incident would be reported to a head of </p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a>department and then it would have become part of the normal criminal report which would be given to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a>State Security Council. </p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  From time to time the Minister would be informed of the crime situation.  What I </p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a>would not like to pretend is that the State Security Council would have specifically paid attention to that </p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a>report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  What I am trying to determine is in how much detail the general crime report were </p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a>compiled.  Would </p>

<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	256	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a>it for example in the Nietverdiend incident, I don't know if you know about it, it is the case where youths </p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a>were recruited for military training, loaded into a minibus and then eliminated. In such an incident would </p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>the detail of such an operation be contained in that type of report or would a report be made with regards to </p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a>X-amount of terrorists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  It would purely have been a report about X-amount of persons having been killed </p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a>under the certain circumstances nothing more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  General, just to add to that, where there were reports made by the applicants about </p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a>actions where they were involved, to their commanding officers and, where there was never any form of </p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a>repudiation, let us forget about the reports going higher up, would you say that it could have strengthened </p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a>the perception of the applicants that what they were busy doing was the kind of action which was, I won't </p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>say it was approved, but which was implicitly accepted by the commanding officers and the authorities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  If I understand your correctly, do you mean that all the facts as set out in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a>Amnesty application now for the Commanding Officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  What I am saying is that if there was a short report given with regards to the core of </p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a>what was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Surely you also mean the involvement of the applicant in that saying I was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a>involved. Immediately that Commanding Officer would have become part of the act which had taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a>place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  What I mean is, I am merely speaking about the perception of the applicant if no one </p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a>went back to the </p>

<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a>applicant with regard to this act would the applicants' perception then be deemed that the authorities </p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a>approved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Then it was no longer a perception, then it was a fact, if his Commanding Officer </p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a>knew about this act and did nothing about it then implicity the Commanding Officer agreed and then he </p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a>had all the reason in the world to believe that he bore the approval of his Commanding Officer, because the </p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a>Commanding Officer then granted his implied approval.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  General, could you tell the Committee about your involvement at Vlakplaas. You </p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a>were never a Commanding Officer at Vlakplaas but could you just tell the Committee about your </p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a>involvement at Vlakplaas and how you were involved with Vlakplaas at Commanding Officer level.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  I think I have already testified about Vlakplaas, if you remember correctly where I </p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a>said that the Unit there was brought to a halt with the view to arresting persons there and rehabilitating </p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a>them - persons who had been arrested had to be rehabilitated and then I did try and assist in tracing persons </p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a>who were coming from the outside to commit acts of terrorism here and also use them as witnesses against </p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a>such persons in a court of law and there was no objective for that Unit, and what happened in the course of </p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a>time is that it developed due to the circumstances. I think I, myself was there twice at the most. I had no </p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a>liaison with them, but that is as far as my knowledge of Vlakplaas goes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  I was referring to the rank structure, were you ever Commanding Officer there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  I won't question you about that anymore. I </p>

<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a>would now like to come to an aspect which came to the fore in the application of the applicants, that is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a>involvement of youths in the Liberation Movements. You knew about the ANC and the liberation </p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a>movements' methods, their tactics and their ideologies, can you briefly comment to this Committee about </p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a>your experience and your knowledge of the involvement of youths, and now I am referring to specifically </p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a>school children in acts of terrorism and also instigating boycotts and stone-throwing incidents and so forth </p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a>in areas where unrest was rife, especially in the '80's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman after the 1976 riots, which of course focused on the youth mainly, </p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a>there was a sharp increase in the involvement of youths in the struggle. Large amounts of youths went out </p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a>to receive military training and these youths became much more militant and the ANC also realised, mainly </p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a>the ANC, realised that this was an opportunity for a new approach because it was generally accepted that in </p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a>1976 it was the watershed as far as the liberation movement of the ANC was concerned. Thereafter, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a>experienced the situation increasingly where youths were becoming involved in violence to such an extent </p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a>that during the State of Emergency in 1986 and 7 and thereafter we were obligated to detain large amounts </p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a>of youths who, not only participated in actions, boycotts and such in the townships but were also involved </p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a>in necklacing.  And we had great problems with that because you can obliviously imagine how much </p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a>opposition there was to the fact that there were even persons as young as 13 whom we would detain, due to </p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a>the fact that their parents could not control them and they spiralled out of control under those </p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a>circumstances.</p>

<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Very well General, I do not want to go into the commanding channels in too much </p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a>detail, but I would like to ask a question, the Sanhedrin that we heard about here, is it possible that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a>Minister or Deputy Minister of Defence would occasionally attend meetings of the Sanhedrin and then </p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a>would issue instructions there as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Did you say the Minister of Defence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  No the Minister of Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Surely, it is possible that the Minister would attend from time to time by way of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a>courtesy gesture but not on a regular basis,.  It was possible that he could have made the input from time to </p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a>time, just shared ideas, but I cannot think of specific incidents but it could have happened during the course </p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a>of events.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  General, in the South African Police itself with regards to training and normal day to </p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a>day activities, the normal policemen who were busy with the work and specifically policemen in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a>Security Branch, were they aware of the revolutionary onslaught of the Liberation Movements, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a>ideologies behind that and the objectives of the organisations?  Before you answer that I would like to </p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a>show you a document.  It is a document called "Die Strategy of the ANC" it is dated 15 March 1985. It was </p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a>compiled by the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  You put it very euphemistically by saying it is a "document"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a>MR VISSER:   Mr Chairman, I have not been provided with a copy of this document which is now put to </p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a>my witness. I am just wondering whether there is a specific reason for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, the specific reason is Mr Mpshe also hasn't got a copy, I apologise, I </p>

<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a>enough copies, I had copies available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a>JUDGE MALL:  I would like us to have some limit within which we must proceed. I don't like the idea of </p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a>documents being handed in whenever it is convenient to counsel to do so. You are re-examining this </p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a>witness and I do not think it fair that at this stage you hand in a voluminous document, none of us have a </p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a>chance of knowing what it is all about and so on, with the result that this kind of questioning can just </p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a>snowball for ever and ever. I would like you to conclude your re-examination of this witness then apply for </p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a>permission to hand in documents and tell us why.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairman, the only reason why I am handing in this document now, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a>because of the fact that I am not going to lead any evidence about this document except about where this </p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a>document comes from and how this document was compiled. The reason for this ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Have you finished your re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  I have finished the re-examination, Mr Chairman. May I then ask permission to deal </p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a>with the document?  The only reason why I am doing this, Mr Chairman is I wanted to deal with this </p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a>document in argument, but I thought it prudent that this document be handed into the Committee at this </p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a>stage because it relates to a specific aspect that I want to ask the General about and that is the simple </p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a>reason, I am trying to assist the Committee, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a>JUDGE MALL:  As experienced counsel you are aware of the limits of re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Right, Mr Chairman. I will then deal with the document in argument and I will </p>

<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV DU PLESSIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a>JUDGE MALL:   I would like to thank the witness for having made himself available - you want to ask </p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a>some questions, I am sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Yes.  I am sorry, there are two points that I would like to deal with General. The first is </p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a>Nietverdiend that you have been asked about and reports - as I understand this happened in </p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a>Bophuthatswana and was investigated by the Bophuthatswana police and that didn't fall under you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  You are totally correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  The second point is Vlakplaas.  This was a most unusual station, wasn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  It was as I understand it, an old farmhouse far away from anywhere that was taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a>over for a specific Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  That is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  They originally, I think you said, the purpose was to deal with persons who had </p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a>returned to this country to try to rehabilitate them to use, they were called ascaris and thereafter they started </p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a>being used to carry out more offensive activities. It seems to me that a policeman who was sent to </p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a>Vlakplaas and stationed there, might well have got the impression that they were a specific Unit formed to </p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a>carry out these specific anti-terrorist duties, that they were something out of the ordinary run of the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Yes, that is correct, but you must keep in mind that they had a specific task, it was an </p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a>abnormal task. First of all people that were arrested were dealt with in </p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	260	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a>covert action and their actions were abnormal that they had taken, that is the correct impression.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  The Commissioner is asking, this Unit was used to exercise actions in Lesotho for </p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a>instance, on command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  So they were actually the military wing of the police, can I put it like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  I wouldn't say the "War Wing" but they were used in an abnormal way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Was that abnormal way to kill people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  It was to do cross-border operations, it was never intended for them to act internally, </p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a>but they had to act where it was required to cross-border.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  But we have heard evidence, as I recollect, of them being used internally, being </p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a>summonsed to various parts of the country, usually, admittedly, close to the borders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  That is correct, but once again, not to eliminate people, they got specific tasks. There </p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a>were specific threats sometimes that they had to deal with because they had information and they had </p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a>special ways of doing that and dealing with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  It seems to me, from what we have heard and from what we have heard from you, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a>that it is easy to understand that persons stationed there might get a false impression of precisely what their </p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a>duties were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  You are absolutely correct, Honourable member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  That they, having been sent to this odd place might believe they were wrongly perhaps </p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a>but they could </p>

<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a>JUDGE WILSON	261	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a>honestly believe they were there to carry out these functions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a>GEN. V/D MERWE:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Who was the highest authority inasfar as Vlakplaas was concerned, who gave instructions </p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a>at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Vlakplaas was under the command of the head of security police, not directly, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a>had their own commander, but in terms of the command line, they were under the head of the Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a>Branch and he was under the Commissioner so that was the normal command line in the case of Vlakplaas, </p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a>but because of the abnormal circumstances which they have operated the normal command line might not </p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a>have been, might not have applied like in normal cases - it would have been the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a>JUDGE MALL:  So it would be the head of the Security Police basically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  That is correct Your Worship. That is apart from their own Commander, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a>obviously in all the cases there was a Commander in charge of the Vlakplaas Unit but he in terms would </p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a>have to report - he was under the command of the head of Security Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  General, with regard to the reports, the way the reports would be compiled from time </p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a>to time relating to specific incidents, for example, the killing of, or the elimination of some targets, I get the </p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a>impression that sometimes, if not always, the reports would not be detailed they would be in a crisp form, </p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a>for example, simply saying that 10 terrorists were eliminated at such and such a place and that kind of </p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a>report in that form, would be passed onto the next person etc. etc.</p>

<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE	261	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  You are correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  If that was the case, it seems to me that when we consider whether or not higher </p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a>authorities had given a tacit approval, we may have to bear in mind the fact that they might not have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a>furnished with all the facts and details of the facts and circumstances under which a particular incident </p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a>occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman, we must be clear on this. They would have been supplied by </p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a>particulars on the specific incident. The information that you now have would not have been submitted to </p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a>them, that we must realise.  They would have been noted on the number of people that were shot, under </p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a>certain circumstances, and what were the surrounding situations but details they would not have had before </p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a>then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  But the person who compiles the report decides what to put in and what not to put in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  You are correct, but please bear in mind that, a person who was shot, that case would </p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a>have been reported in a normal fashion. The person now applying for Amnesty would not have personally </p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a>reported it, some other people on the scene might have reported it and the report would have been based on </p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a>what happened on the scene and what was investigated by police on the scene.  So one must make a </p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a>distinction between members applying for Amnesty, whether they have reported it themselves, what is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a>content thereof and whether on the other hand the person left the scene and the police then afterwards sent </p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a>someone there to investigate and that the facts then reported depended on exactly what was found on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a>scene of the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Nevertheless the person who compiles the report is the person who in the first </p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a>instance, </p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE	262	GEN V/D MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a>subjectively, as you said earlier on, believed that what he was doing was justified and he compiles the </p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a>report from that premises</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Not necessarily, I don't know whether that was the case at all, the reports that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a>have here before us, it might be the case that people that were involved left the scene and to now create the </p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a>impression that there was an incident could be misleading. People that were killed, that case would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a>been reported and the contents of such a report would have reflected what were the tasks of the people at </p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a>that point in time in terms of the law. Mention would not have been made of action out of the abnormal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  I am just concerned that it is highly inconceivable that the person who has in the first </p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a>instance subjectively believed that what he did was right would compile the report in such an objective </p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a>manner that room could be left for somebody else to come and say that the action was not justified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Yes, but we have to make a distinction.  The person could have believed what he has </p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a>done did it in terms of his objectives to prevent the country being overthrown. I cannot think he would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a>thought that what he was doing was justified, what I am saying he must have believed that what he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a>doing was to save the country. You must read it against that background and therefore that he might have </p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a>felt that he was justified in his actions, although he exceeded his limits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Now the Minister comes, one of the previous Ministers and he comes and gives </p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a>testimony here and he says "No, I deny giving permission, the reports I have, the reports submitted to me </p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a>did not give the full details". PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>

<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Yes, you are correct, if that was the case that is the way he should have acted. There </p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a>were never reports that indicated what you now know to the previous Minister, he never had that </p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a>information. If the real information was available and we accepted then we would have been partially </p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a>responsible for it.  There could have then been more information that we based our actions on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  In your case, the case of Swaziland there was some - a task given by Brigadier Schoon, </p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a>go and kill this person, the report would have been "we have done our duty"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  We have also heard the term in your evidence, also other cases that there was a policy </p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a>of "need to know" you don't give more information that is than information required for the person that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a>have passed it on to, do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Yes, that was policy in fact. That was general policy in terms of all information </p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a>services. Information is dealt with in a very restricted manner, so you only give information that that person </p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a>needs to know, that has always been the case.  But remember there is another kind of information that is </p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a>necessary to provide to all people. Now you must remember the person in this case would, that has given </p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a>the command, would have received a report back and he would only have received information that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a>required.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  So the person who committed the murder he would not spread the word, he would only </p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a>give facts back to the person that has given the command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  That is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  As I understand from what you are saying, again this was completely different from </p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a>ordinary policing. There was no question of opening a docket, setting out what was done, anything of that </p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a>nature, it would usually be an oral instruction, they would carry out the operation and inform the person </p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a>who had instructed them that they had completed what they had been told to do and there would be no </p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a>written report made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Mr Chairman, in those cases where there was authority granted by a higher authority, </p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a>you are correct, no there would not have been a report. You are correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, may I put two further questions to the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you.  It is really questions in elucidation about matters which I have forgotten </p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a>about. </p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a>General could you assist me, Commissioner De Jager asked me yesterday if in the police there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a>special meaning to the word "eliminate" or if the normal meaning of the word applied, in other words to </p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a>kill someone, could you assist us in that regard?  If someone was to talk about "I received instruction to go </p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a>and eliminate someone" is there a special meaning to that in the police or does the normal meaning apply?</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  No, the normal meaning applied, it would be to get rid of someone, to kill someone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  If someone were to testify about what happened at Vlakplaas and what took place </p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a>there was known to all the Generals in the police force, would that be a correct statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a>GEN V/D MERWE:  Definitely not, Your Worship. As I have </p>

<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a>already testified with regards to certain incidents we would know, but as far as many other incidents are </p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a>concerned, like which are being placed before this Committee, we did not know about. What you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a>saying is "all Generals" is a very broad statement, not all Generals would have known about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV DU PLESSIS</p>
