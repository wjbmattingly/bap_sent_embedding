<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>JUDGE MALL:	... video to be shown, I leave this in the hands of my learned friends who are lawyers as </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>well as technicians, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, first of all, we would like to apologise </p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>for the fact that we are starting a little bit late.  It is due to one specific problem and that is that we exactly </p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>pin-pointed last night on a time counter on a video machine, exactly which excerpts we want to show.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>However, the video machine that was provided to us this morning, does not seem to have a time counter </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>that is working. </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>	That is why I tried to fix that and it seems that I can't get passed that.  If you will excuse me, then </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>what I will do is we will try to show to you the excerpts that we decided last night to do, but I will in all </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>probability have to search backwards and forwards a little bit if you would allow me that opportunity. </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Yes, certainly, certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, we intend to show just parts of the Prime Evil video which we deem </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>important and then I intend to, with your permission, call Captain Hechter, just to give very shortly, some </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>comments and some evidence on certain of the aspects that we intend to show.  There are </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>72</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>two video's.  The one video will deal with Prime Evil, or is</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>the Prime Evil video with some excerpts that we deem important and, the second video is a video which </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>deals with inter alia the actions of comrades and the actions of</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>activists.  It shows necklaces and what is also very important, is it shows exactly what kind of violence the </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>South African Police was, and probably still is exposed to, today.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>	I have to point out to you, that in respect of the second video, there are certain parts of that video </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>that are very gruesome. We think that it is important that we should show that because of the fact that that </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>indicates visually what the applicants were exposed to from day to day at that time, but I have to warn you </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>that some of the excerpts are very gruesome.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Shall we clear this room of all those under 25?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 Mr Chairman, whoever is going to be offended, and I can say to you that it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>going to be bad, should not look then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	Where are we going to see this video?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Here in this room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	In this room, yes, on the screen in front of you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	Well in that case, can you please ask them to turn out that bright light, Ms </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>Khampepe and I have to look straight at to see the video?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 Yes, I'll see to that.  Having looked at the light, Mr Chairman, I understand </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>that completely.  May I proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>JUDGE MALL:	It's made a vast difference thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>72</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 May I proceed?  Thank you Mr Chairman.   Mr Chairman, before I go ahead, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>have to point out that I am not going to show certain parts.  If the Committee feels I am going to fast </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>forward it on the basis that one can see it on the screen, if the Committee feels that they want to view </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>something specifically, please indicate to me or otherwise if the Committee wants to see the whole video, </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>we can show the whole video.  I don't know what the Committee would prefer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Well, at this stage we don't have a clue as to what we are about to see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 Alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS PLAYS THE VIDEO</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>EXCERPTS OF VIDEO:	It was a time of growing Black resistance against the National Party's apartheid </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>policy.  Most White people believed it was a communist onslaught against Christianity and civilization.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>The Soviet must be stopped in Southern Africa.  We need your help as a team to stand up against the evil </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>forces wishing to destroy our lovely country.  There is too much to be protected to leave it in the hands of </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>irresponsible people.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>	(Excerpt)  We were also taught, I mean we were literally taught to hate.  If you look at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>Security course that I went on for five weeks we were subjected to and we swallowed all of this - the </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>ranting and raving of a person that I describe as a cross between Eugene Terreblanche and Adolf Hitler, </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>about the satanic godless communists, and their Black surrogates that were going to swamp us.  I've got for </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>example, my Criminology and Ethnology training manual from when I joined the Police and I can read to </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>you a little piece here about the differences </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>73</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>between Whites and Non-Whites in respect of crime.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>		"The Bantu are less civilized, the more primitive the people is, the less they are able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>control their emotions.  At the slightest provocation they resort to violence.  They cannot </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>distinguish between serious and less serious matters, they are less self-controlled and </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>more impulsive."</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>This video was taken at the Police Training ....</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Mr Chairman, I am going to comment every now and then just to indicate the </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>relevance of certain parts of the video.  You will recall that evidence was given in respect of this specific </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>issue by Brig. Cronje in respect of the propaganda that the Police was subjected to, and this is a further </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>indication of exactly what kind of propaganda they were subjected to at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>JUDGE MALL:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>SCREENING OF VIDEO CONTINUES:	It shows White policemen undergoing anti-terrorist training, </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>a mock ambush is set up.  	Eugene de Kock's predecessor at Vlakplaas is Captain Dirk Coetzee, who </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>completed his Officer's training in 1975, one year before De Kock.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>(DE KOCK SPEAKS):  We had a special lecturer, Brigadier Neels du Plooy, who was the so-called </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>specialist, a big Christian too, and he came to lecture us junior officers on communism, terrorism and </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>worked us up into a frenzy with his knowledge and the viciousness and the cruelty of the enemy, of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>communist, of the terrorist.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>	These people they call human beings, how could they cut up nuns in East London during the riots </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>in those early years, and they deserved nothing else but the worst, no mercy at all.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>74</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>	After his training .....</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>	No casualties were sustained by Security Forces and follow up operations are continuing.  That is </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>the end of this communication.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>COMMENTARY CONTINUES:  It was a war in which 40,000 people died, fought between the White </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>dominated forces of Ian Smith and the liberation armies or Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo.  South </p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>Africa refused to impose United Nations' sanctions </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>against Rhodesia.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>	Our orders, and ever since 1965 we refused to be a party to these boycotts and the policy of South </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>Africa will remain.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>	Including war supplies you will continue to allow them to go through ... (indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>	I am afraid the answer that I have just given you, is the answer that I want to give you at this </p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>stage.  Unofficially, however, the Government had to help its northern neighbour.  South African </p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>policemen were sent to fight alongside the Rhodesian counterparts.  This film was shot in 1974 and shows </p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>South African policemen on war duty in Rhodesia.  (Indistinct) and De Kock were amongst them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Mr Chairman, I show this because Brigadier Cronje has given evidence that his </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>started his career partly in the Rhodesian war and that the South African police were already at that stage </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>involved in a war situation and not simply involved in a situation pertaining to normal police duties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>SCREENING OF VIDEO CONTINUES:	... He was very, very loyal to the cause.  A man </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>who was practically skilled in the skills and the arts of warfare.  The man who was in hundreds of contacts, </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>who was in multiple landmine explosions, a man who PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>75</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>for 20 years, for two decades ...(fast forward)</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>	Policemen in battle dress, armed to the teeth, rising on top of armed vehicles, called caspers.  In </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>front of the caspers, a group of trackers running on the spoor of SWAPO insurgents.  These were the men </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>of Koevoet, the police counter-insurgency unit, during the Namibian Bush war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>The unit with the highest kill rate, but also implicated in committing atrocities against the local people.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, I show this to indicate the police's involvement in the Namibian bush </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>war as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>SCREENING OF VIDEO CONTINUES:	 ... wait in the base and send you out after - on a mission that </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>could get you killed, and he expected you to follow him on such a mission.  People develop a hero worship </p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>for such a man.  (Indistinct) with his people inside the trucks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Mr Chairman that was the evidence given about Brigadier Cronje by, as far as I </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>can recall Captain Hechter and of the other applicants.  He was a similar kind of man and he was involved </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>also in operations, not just behind his desk, but he was involved as a leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>SCREENING OF VIDEO CONTINUES:	... leave Koevoet and come back to South Africa because </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>"die vyand is nou hierso", the enemy is now in our backyard, not on the Angolan border.  It is strange to me </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>that anybody should be surprised at what he then did and the way he would then react.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Mr Chairman, you must just please bear with me, I am finding it a little bit </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>difficult in finding the right places.  I've got the correct time slots where they should be, but as I told you I </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>can't find them so, please just bear with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>SCREENING OF VIDEO CONTINUES:	  .... with Mozambique.  The </p>

<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>basically the armed wing of the National Party.  It was from here that Death Squads hunted down and </p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>killed anti-apartheid activists.  Dirk Coetzee found Vlakplaas in 1980, Eugene De Kock went to Vlakplaas </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>in 1983 and became Commander two years later.  Craig Williamson knew and worked with both men.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>	They were the basically, the armed wing of the National Party.  They were the National Party's </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>equivalent of Umkhonto weSizwe.  They were people who believed absolutely that they had a mission, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>they had a job that only they could do, not only for themselves, but for their country, for their people, for </p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>their church and for their future and for their survival and for everybody else's survival.  For their people </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>and their "Volk's" survival.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>	The formation of Vlakplaas signalled a new phase in the Government's campaign against the </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>ANC.  Craig Williamson calls it the Secret War.  Williamson is not only a former Security Policeman, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>he was also National Party member of the President's Council.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>	None of us who were doing that job in those years were policemen in the sense of upholding law </p>

<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>Seeing that we are watching something on Brian Ngqulunga and</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a>the wife and the relatives are here, that it be re-shown and they be allowed to come and sit at a place where </p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>they can see that for themselves.  It is a request.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>JUDGE MALL:	When you say they are here, do you mean they are in this hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a>ADV MPSHE:	They are in this hall, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Then, should they not be able to see it now whilst it is being shown to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a>ADV MPSHE:	That is the request I am making that they be allowed to come forward and see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Oh, I thought you said they should be screened to them on another occasion.  Certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 Yes, Mr Chairman, while we are on this point, Captain Mentz will testify </p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>about this specific incident and especially relating to the orders that they were given in respect of Brian </p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>Ngqulunga.  I am showing this video now before Captain Mentz' evidence.</p>

<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>84</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>	I just want to indicate to you at this stage that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>evidence of Captain Mentz will be that he and the others that were instructed to eliminate Brian Ngqulunga </p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a>were never informed of the reason that is now alleged by Mr Mamasela to have been the reason for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>elimination.  I am just making that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Noted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 Yes, and Mr Chairman furthermore I want to point out to you that Mamasela </p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a>was not involved in that operation at all.  So the evidence that is shown on the video will, to a certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>extent, be contradicted by the evidence of Captain Mentz.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>PORTION OF VIDEO RE-SHOWN</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Mr Chairman, I am just making hundred percent sure that I've covered </p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a>everything.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>	Mr Chairman I would like with your permission, in respect of this video before we show the other </p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>video, to call Brigadier Cronje very shortly just to give his comments on one or two of the aspects.I want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>make one other point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>	After having, well showing the excerpt of Brian Ngqulunga, I realised that the excerpt itself and </p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>what was said in the excerpt is obviously detrimental and perhaps prejudicial to Captain Mentz' application.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a>We, however, decided that because of the fact that we are speaking the truth from Captain Mentz' point of </p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>view and what happened to him, that it would be in our interest to show this excerpt in respect of Brian </p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a>Ngqulunga even if what was said there, might and I am not saying that it does, but might contradict what </p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a>Captain Mentz' evidence is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>	I want to make that point very clear Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a>JUDGE MALL:	You will obviously tell us who compiled that </p>

<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Yes, we will be able to give you the </p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a>information Mr Chairman, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a>JUDGE MALL:	The Committee will take a short adjournment at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a>COMMITTEE RESUMES.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>JUDGE MALL:	In fairness to counsel I think it should be told that a member of the Committee felt that </p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>as a result of what we had seen, a certain question may be cleared up amongst ourselves and it was in order </p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a>to discuss that point,</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>that this short adjournment was taken and I am hoping it hasn't inconvenienced anybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, may I allowed to call Brigadier </p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>Cronje very shortly for five minutes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Yes, certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>BRIGADIER JACK CRONJE:	(s.u.o)</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a>EXAMINATION BY ADV DU PLESSIS:	 Brigadier, you have now seen the video.  Parts of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>Rhodesian war and the Namibian Bush war.  Do you confirm that you were also involved in a similar </p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>manner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	  Brigadier, you also heard what Craig Williamson said in the video with </p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>regards to the fact that the Security Branch was the military wing of the National Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 Do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	Yes, I do.</p>

<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 You've also heard the ex-President Botha specifically speaking about the fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>that ANC activists, I think he said ANC activists and terrorists, would be eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 Did you hear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 Brigadier could you just give the Committee an indication of how you </p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a>regarded that in the light of Brigadier Victor's instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	Brigadier Victor probably received his instruction from higher up and I thus believed </p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>that his</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a>instructions came from higher up and that these were the correct instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS: And Brigadier, do you regard it in the light of what has been said in the video by </p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>President Botha that there was a possibility that the instruction came from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	Yes, I saw it as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 Brigadier, you also saw what was said with regard to the Zero hand grenade </p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>incident, was there anything you would like to dispute with regards to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>BRIG CRONJE:   I would like to differ in the sense that De Kock was not in charge of the Operation, I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>in charge of the Operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 Very well. Brigadier it appears as though the producers of the video, either out </p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a>of ignorance or for convenience sake, the period which you were in charge of Vlakplaas or otherwise </p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a>omitted to include that in the video would you care to give any explanation to that effect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	I cannot give any explanation.  I would like to say to the Committee that I took over </p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a>from Coetzee and </p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	86	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a>not De Kock.  And furthermore I would like to say that the people who worked with me, did not look </p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>anything like the people on the video.  I refer to Colonel Venter, he was the type of man who worked with </p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a>me.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a>	Furthermore, parties as the one on the beach, would not have been, never have been allowed in </p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a>my time.  I would also like to say that De Kock was transferred to me from Koevoet, I did not want him </p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a>there, but I was given an instruction to take him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a>	Those type of things never happened under my command and it would never have happened </p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a>under my command, I kept my</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a>foot on De Kock's throat and such things would never have happened under my command.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 Brigadier, as far as Dirk Coetzee's evidence is concerned that he was like God </p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a>over there and he could do as he pleased, what is your comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	It did not work like that Mr Chairman.  Dirk Coetzee exaggerated as far as that is </p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a>concerned, that is not how we operated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 Very well then.  Brigadier, what is said there by Craig Williamson with </p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a>regards to the involvement of the Generals in Vlakplaas, that what happened at Vlakplaas happened with </p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a>the knowledge of the Generals, do you identify with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	Could you please repeat that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 What Craig Williamson said on the video with regards to the involvement of </p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a>the Generals in Vlakplaas and the fact that they knew and also the higher authorities, the fact that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a>knew about the operations of Vlakplaas, do you identify with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	Yes, I do, they all knew what was happening </p>

<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	When you say "all" do you mean every single General in the police force or are </p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>you limiting yourself to a limited number?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	I would limit it to the Generals in the Security Branch, the Commissioner of South </p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a>African Police, who were all members of the Security Branch before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 Brigadier, at some stage there were also photographs of the members posing </p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>for photographs with corpses laying around as if they were very proud of what they had done, was that </p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a>your approach at the time, did you allow such things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	No, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 Thank you Mr Chairman I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV DU PLESSIS.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Whose decision was it to transfer De Kock from Koevoet to Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	As I understood it, De Kock had been such a cause of trouble in Oshakati by fighting </p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a>that they had no option, his Commanding Officer there requested that he be transferred and Brigadier </p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>Schoon instructed me to take him in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Was there a time when you and Dirk Coetzee were together at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a>JUDGE MALL:   Precisely how would reports of what was happening at Vlakplaas be conveyed to </p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a>headquarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	It would have been done orally, Chairperson and would very seldom have been done in </p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a>writing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a>JUDGE MALL:	How would instructions to Vlakplaas or to </p>

<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a>88	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a>you be conveyed from headquarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	Also orally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a>JUDGE MALL:   Would there be an intermediary between the people that were going to give you </p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a>instructions and yourself or would the instructions be conveyed to you directly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	To me directly, Chairperson.  To me directly, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	You were asked about the video that we've looked at and in particular what I </p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a>want to ask you about is a speech made by Mr P.W. Botha.  You remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a>BRIG CRONJE;	Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	Is it correct that the video we have just been shown, consisted largely of </p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>extracts from earlier news</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a>reports, matters of that nature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	It appeared to me as such Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	That the speech that we heard from Mr P.W. Botha was a speech he made in </p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a>the 1980's, not something that was made for this video?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	I do not know when he made it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	It was in the past, something you, all of us would have heard many years ago?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	And ...(indistinct) at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	And the second matter which is not of the same relevance is these parties on </p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a>the beach we're showed, there had been frequent complaints in the Natal Parks Board about a certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a>military place down on the coast there, is that where the parties were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	It seems to me that it was at a house on the north coast.</p>

<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a>88	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Brigadier Cronje, the reports you said were done verbally to head office, were these </p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a>done during regular meetings or were they done at any time when an incident took place or how often were </p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a>these reports submitted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	The way in which we operated was that I had four divisions which worked in different </p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a>regions.  One for example in Natal, one in the Eastern Transvaal, the other in the Northern Transvaal and </p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a>so forth, and depending on what took place there at the end of the month those people would come back </p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a>and report to me and I would report to my head, Brigadier Schoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	So it was not a report made at a formal meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Were there any agreements, standing</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a>agreements where strategic reports would be made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	Every morning Brigadier Schoon would attend the San Hedrin and I would - what I </p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a>reported back to him, he would report back to this San Hedrin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a>MR CURRIN:  We have no questions at this stage, thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a>FURTHER EXAMINATION BY ADV DU PLESSIS:	Mr Chairman, I just want to ask two questions </p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a>pertaining to the questions that the Committee asked.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a>	Brigadier, the parties which they showed here, I believed that they were held at Sodwana, was it </p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a>during Colonel De Kock's time, do you know during which period these parties took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	I do not know during which period they took place, but they had to have been during his </p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a>period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 Would Captain Mentz be able to give us a bit PRETORIA </p>

<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a>more detail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	I believe so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	 I would just like to put it to you for the Committee's benefit, that Captain </p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a>Mentz will say that those parties were held in the 1990's, so that was long after you had left Vlakplaas.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a>Brigadier Cronje, would you say that it is possible that the fact that you were not mentioned in this video is </p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a>simply because you were not involved in sensational incidents such as De Kock and them, could you just </p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a>comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	I suspect that that is the reason why I am not mentioned as a Commanding Officer.</p>

<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a>something?  Can you see me, I am a bit far away?</p>

<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a>MR VISSER:  Mr Chairman, first of all we must place ourselves on record before the Committee.  Acting </p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a>for certain people who have applied for amnesty and we have some points which we wish to make in </p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a>regard to the evidence and particularly Section 19(4) notices.  We don't want to interrupt at this stage, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a>reason why I am addressing you right now is ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a>JUDGE MALL:	I would rather you tell me who you are appearing for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a>MR VISSER:	Mr Chairman, for record purposes, my name is L.J.L. Visser, I am instructed by </p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a>Wagenaar, Muller &amp; Du Plessis.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a>	May I hand up to you a document, Mr Chairman, which will summarise what I wish to say to you </p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a>right now and part of the reason why I wish to hand it up to you is you will </p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a>MR VISSER	90	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a>find an annexure attached to the document which I present to you right now, that contains the names of </p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a>those people whom we represent in their amnesty applications.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a>	May I by way of short introduction Mr Chairman say that we act if you look at the annexure </p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a>containing the names if they were numbered, you would have seen that they number 81 on the list as they </p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a>stand at present.  So presently we act for 81 applicants, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a>	Mr Chairman, what this really is about is the issue of how the Committee is going to deal in future </p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a>with evidence of applicants before you which implicate other individuals.  more in particular, those for </p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a>whom I appear.  It appears to us Mr Chairman, and we have stated that at page 2, that in regard to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a>Section 19(4) notices, there appears to us to be two permutations mainly and that is that our clients might </p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a>deny their involvement or alternatively they might </p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a>admit their involvement.  Now ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Or there is another alternative - might ignore it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a>MR VISSER:	Well, we can assure you we are not going to ignore it.  So as far as we are concerned that </p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a>is not a permutation.  What we wish to say just at this stage very shortly Mr Chairman, is that insofar as our </p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a>clients either admit or deny being implied by other applicants, we, as we stated to you yesterday in your </p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>chambers, if we know of an incident which is going to be brought before you on a particular date, we will </p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a>see to it that we are here and that we inform you of the exact position of that particular implicated client of </p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a>ours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a>	Broadly speaking ins far as, we don't want to go through this every time for 81 people, and that is </p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a>why we've PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a>MR VISSER	91	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a>handed in this little document, simply to say that where we admit being involved, it does not necessarily </p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a>mean that we agree with the evidence tendered by an applicant before you or with his particular motivation, </p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>it goes without saying, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a>	The reason why we make this point right now is that it does not occur to us to be the time or the </p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a>place to place in issue all the evidence placed before you by the present applicants, where we should </p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a>disagree with them.  We would be in your hands as to how you want to deal with those disputes, all that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a>will do at this stage, and we undertake to do, is to draw your attention to any disputes which may exist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a>	What we want to make absolutely clear is that we are not objecting on behalf of any of our clients </p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a>to any of the applications now before you.  If it should happen Mr</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a>Chairman, that on the evidence as disputed perhaps by any of our clients in future, it becomes necessary for </p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a>you to make credibility findings, well then we will have to be led by you at that stage, presently we are </p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a>assuming that there may not be such material disputes as will disenable you to make a finding on their </p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a>application.  We are hoping that that is going to be the situation that prevails.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a>	I will finish Mr Chairman, this is really a build up to the question of the Section 19(4) notices.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a>We are in this position for example, this morning we heard evidence which affect Victor and Schoon for </p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a>whom we appear and we had no notice that this was going to happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a>	Now quite clearly from an administrative point of view, it occurs to us that the Committee is in an </p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a>invidious position.   My attorney and myself discussed yesterday the </p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a>MR VISSER	91	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a>practical situation that acting for these people, we know in which incidents they are involved, but Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a>Mpshe does not, for the simple reason that an applicant may not have mentioned the name and he informs </p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a>us that he hasn't read through all the amnesty applications, so he is completely in the dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a>	What we wish to suggest by way of assisting if we can, is that my attorney should draw up a list </p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a>of incidents of all the incidents in which our applicants are involved, for example the Nietverdiend incident </p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a>and the Zero incident and whatever and then give a list of names of our clients who are involved in those </p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a>incidents to Mr Mpshe, so as to make it possible for him to give us 19(4) notices.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a>	May I just, while we are on the issue of 19(4) issues, make our position clear.  We have in fact, </p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a>my attorney has in fact told Mr Mpshe it is not necessary to give us the</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a>notices and then we reconsidered.  The problem with that Mr Chairman, is that it is one thing to know that </p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a>you are implicated, but it is another thing to know on what evidence.	We had to retract that offer and </p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a>you will see that in the letter which we've handed up to you which you ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Wasn't it perhaps accepted before you retracted it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a>MR VISSER:  Well, my learned friend Mr Mpshe did not take that point against us, Mr Chairman and I'm </p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a>hoping that we don't have to go into the law of contract on that issue. But the point is that it does seem </p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a>necessary to know beforehand Mr Chairman what the other person who implicates our clients, is going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a>say.  I think it is a matter of logic, so it is not as if we wish to make more work for Mr Mpshe, </p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a>MR VISSER	92	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a>but it occurs to us to be necessary and I just wanted to explain that.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a>	So Mr Chairman, thank you for listening to me for so long, but what we suggest then is that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a>should give you that list and that that would enable Mr Mpshe to give us due notice of when a particular </p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a>incident will be heard and at that stage we will then come and if we may, by way of a short affidavit on </p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a>behalf of that client of ours, simply state very briefly what is in dispute and what is not in dispute.	That </p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a>is the best we can think of offering our assistance at this point in time, but we will obviously be led by </p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>whatever you decide, how you wish to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Speaking for myself, I think that it will be very very helpful to carry out the suggestion </p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a>which you have made about giving us a list of your clients setting out how,</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a>briefly or rather in respect of which matters, they were implicated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a>	I am glad that you appreciate the difficulty we have in carrying out Section 19(4) notices, simply </p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a>because as evidence unfolds names are mentioned, we hear them for the first time and it seems that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a>only way in which that can be done, would be at the end of each day to draw up a list of people whose </p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a>names are mentioned, who may be implicated.  Not people whose names are merely mentioned, but who </p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a>may be implicated and at the end of each day take steps to notify people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a>	But I see that all your clients whose names appear here have themselves applied for amnesty and, </p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a>it may very well be that they will have ample opportunity at that stage to give their version as fully as they </p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a>would like to and the Committee, I can assure you, will give full consideration to PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a>93</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a>the evidence of their account and the extent of their participation in whatever they are applying amnesty </p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a>for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a>	It may be that if we can avoid a repetition of hearing evidence, in other words if we can avoid </p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a>calling a man simply because his name is mentioned and he is given notice in terms of Section 19(4), for </p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a>him to come here and respond to what was said yesterday about him, and then find out that he has made an </p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a>application for amnesty and he will be repeating what he said then, one certainly wants to avoid that.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a>	You understand the time constraints within which this Committee is functioning.  We are always </p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a>looking for ways of streamlining procedures and it would seem that if you furnish this document with what </p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a>your clients have to comment on and in what matters they are implicated in, it will facilitate matters and </p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a>that document should be handed to counsel for the applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a>	Now we understand you are telling us that your clients do not object to the applications for </p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a>amnesty by the applicants.  That is a matter of some importance.  It is a question of hearing their version of </p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a>what is being said and we will have an open mind in that regard and I can assure you on behalf of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a>Committee, that we will do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a>JUDGE WILSON;	Can I add something Mr Visser that I think may be of assistance.  I don't know </p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a>how many of your clients are policemen or army officers, but ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a>MR VISSER:   Mr Chairman, I can answer the question immediately, 80 of them are policemen and one is </p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a>an ex-Minister of Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	It would be much easier to identify them if you could also give ranks, so when </p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a>somebody talks about </p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a>MR VISSER	94	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a>Captain Coetzee, because you've got about five different Coetzee's, if you could put the ranks onto the list, </p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a>I think it would make it easier for Mr Mpshe and others to identify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a>MR VISSER:  We hear what you say Mr Chairman, but there is a problem with that and that is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a>changing of the ranks, but we will do it anyway as near as possible.  We can identify them.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a>	May we accept then that for as far as our clients have been implicated here today, you will </p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a>appreciate that obviously we have no instructions on that, we will not forego any rights by asking you to </p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a>allow whatever our reaction is going to be to stand down to a later date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Quite right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a>MR VISSER:	May I also add Mr Chairman, you've suggested it and we have already done that, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a>have also circulated these affidavits which we spoke about earlier in which we</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a>say what is admitted and what is denied to the applicants' legal representatives.	The reason for that is </p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a>that they might, with that knowledge, be able even from their side to shorten proceedings by perhaps </p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a>avoiding disputes or cutting out disputes where it is possible.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a>	May it please you, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Mr Visser, as far as the affidavits that you've given to the other people, if you intend that </p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a>they should be part of our material to be considered, we will be glad to receive it ourselves so if you could </p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a>hand it into the Commission, if you consider that to be necessary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a>	As far as the evidence given this morning, could I say that insofar as the video's have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a>confirmed under oath, as far as I am concerned that would be considered as evidence, the mere showing of </p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a>the video with a lot of faces </p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>MR VISSER	94	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a>appearing thereon, wouldn't as far as we are concerned, implicate those persons except as far as they've in </p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a>fact implicated by this person giving evidence now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a>MR VISSER:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  Dealing with the last point that certainly accords with our view </p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a>of the law and we are thankful for that direction which you have given.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a>	As far as handing up the affidavits to you, we didn't mention it because we thought it spoke for </p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a>itself, the whole intention of the affidavits would be for your information, for your consumption, but we </p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a>will also make it available to the legal representatives of the applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a>MR VISSER:	Yes, of course we will.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Sisi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a>MR VISSER:	May I say one last thing.  General Johan van</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a>der Merwe, the issue which we spoke about yesterday, I am hoping that I won't have to speak again today, </p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a>so while it is my turn, while I've been given a turn, I wish to put it all in - he will be available on Thursday </p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a>the 27th for Mr Currin to put his questions to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a>MR VISSER:	Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	Mr Visser, would you have any objection in making those affidavits available to legal </p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a>representatives of victims or the relatives of the deceased in respect of which the applicants are applying for </p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a>amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a>MR VISSER:	Mr Chairman, may we respond this way.  Obviously we would have a practical problem, </p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a>knowing who these people are, what we would say with respect Mr Chairman, and my attorney can stop </p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a>me if I am wrong, is that we would have no objection if Mr Mpshe imparted that </p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a>MR VISSER	95	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a>information to - may I just take an instruction on that?  Yes, of course the practical problem is also that as </p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a>we are sitting here we still don't really know what is going to develop so that we can't tell you now that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a>are going to give you affidavits of 81 people, we will have to see what is alleged against them and in fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a>for Schoon we had an affidavit here this morning, which has now become irrelevant because of some of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a>evidence that had been given here, so at the time when Mr Mpshe gets it, it will hopefully be in its semi or </p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a>final form and at that stage we would have no objection to him imparting that information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Thank you.  We think that that is an imminently sensible way of doing it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a>MR VISSER:	Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Mr Visser, only another practicality.  We haven't been supplied with the ranks, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a>would you say that you are representing all the Generals in the Security police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a>MR VISSER:   Not even close, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Because the trouble we've got is that there was a reference to the Generals in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a>Security police would have known, and we can't give notices to people we don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a>MR VISSER:   I was listening to the evidence and that very problem struck me Mr Chairman.  I was saying </p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a>to myself that if I had to cross-examine now I would have to ask who were these Generals, but I didn't want </p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a>to interfere, but we have that problem, but we certainly don't act for all the Generals, no.  You will see from </p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a>the names, although the ranks are not there, from the list you will, I think Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a>MR VISSER	96	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a>Chairman with respect, you will be able to identify the Generals.  We are talking about General Johan </p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a>Coetzee, General Johan van der Merwe - may I just take instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a>	My attorney suggests in order to attempt to assist, if you feel that there are Generals which you </p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a>would like to send Section 19(4) notices to, perhaps to send him a copy of that notice and he might be able, </p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a>or he would probably be able to locate that person and deliver that notice on behalf of the Committee to </p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a>them, which may circumvent that problem Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a>MR VISSER;	Other than that, I am not sure whether we can be of much assistance in that regard.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a>Alright, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Mr Chairman, may I perhaps comment just on two aspects.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a>	The first aspect is that the evidence pertaining to Brigadiers Victor and Schoon which was given </p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a>this morning, was actually in the light of the previous evidence that was given, no more than probably a </p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a>repetition of what was given already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a>	So that evidence was in any event available to Mr Visser and there is nothing new in terms of </p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a>which his clients have been implicated.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a>	In respect of the affidavits that they want to hand up Mr Chairman, clearly we do not have a </p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a>problem with that, except for one aspect thereof, and that is that I would like to be in a position to be able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a>consider the contents of such an affidavit before evidence is led pertaining to a specific incident, so that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a>can take it up with my clients, so that I can lead evidence pertaining to any contradictions PRETORIA </p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a>HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	96	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a>between my client's evidence and whatever is contained in such an affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a>	We do not have any objection that the contents of our amnesty applications be made available to </p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a>Mr Visser for that purpose so that they can go through that and so that they will then obviously be able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a>provide us with copies of such affidavits beforehand.  Obviously it would have an effect on our client's </p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a>applications, because of the fact that the contradictions might cause us certain difficulties which we do not </p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a>know at this stage what facts will be contradicted, otherwise Mr Chairman I will have to ask the Committee </p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a>to recall my clients after giving evidence and after having received the affidavits in specific incidents, </p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a>which I would not want to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes, I think nobody wants to have these proceedings carry on indefinitely.  There must be </p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a>some</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a>finality in the submissions that you wish to make on behalf of your clients, and if the time comes when Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a>Visser's clients make their application for amnesty, the Committee will bear in mind whatever differences </p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a>there are, between the evidence they give and the evidence you give.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a>	Some of these differences may be faulty recollections, because of passage of time, they may be on </p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a>side issues and not on material issues, those are factors which we will take into account, but I think that in </p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a>fairness to your clients, if there is anything material you client's attention will be drawn to those.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Mr Chairman, do I understand then that the Committee will draw our attention to </p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a>any contradictions which the Committee deem important and which will then be taken up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	97	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a>JUDGE MALL:	That is in addition to the fact that you will be given the affidavits by Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a>JUDGE MALL:	You will have an opportunity of deciding yourself as to whether the differences between </p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a>your clients' version and his clients' is on a material issue or on a side issue and so on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Yes, Mr Chairman, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a>JUDGE MALL:	And we rely on your good judgement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Yes, the only point that I am trying to make is that I would prefer having those </p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a>affidavits before my clients give evidence, that is the only request that I have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a>JUDGE MALL:	If that is possible, we must do so.  Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a>MR VISSER:   Mr Chairman, we have offered to make these available to my learned friend.  He hasn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a>been listening to</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a>what I've been saying.  We are under no obligation to him to give it to him, I am not going to undertake to </p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a>give it to him any period of time beforehand because it depends on when they are going to become </p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a>available, we've got the right to place before you evidence where we are implicated Mr  Chairman, so I </p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a>don't need his objection or his admission either.  We've offered it Mr Chairman, we certainly don't want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a>get involved in an argument about it with my learned friend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a>JUDGE MALL:	No, I think it is a question of not merely making a verbal offer, I am talking about </p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a>making them available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a>MR VISSER:	Yes, yes, we will make it available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a>98</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Mr Chairman, I still don't understand my learned friend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a>JUDGE MALL:	I think if you have a chat with him during the adjournment you might be able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a>understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Yes, alright, then I would like to do that Mr Chairman, because I don't understand </p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a>my learned friend to say that he will give it before we give evidence, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a>JUDGE MALL;	Alright, would you clear it up with him during the adjournment, please.  I'd like us to </p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a>proceed with the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Yes.  Mr Chairman, I just want to make this clear, if we are not going to be provided </p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a>the opportunity of having sight of whatever they are going to place before the Committee ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Mr du Plessis how can he reply to an allegation before you've given evidence?  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a>obviously has to hear the evidence and then reply thereto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   But Mr Chairman because the evidence is contained in the applications and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a>offered to make the applications available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Ja, he hasn't had the applications up to now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   But we are offering to make it available now, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a>JUDGE MALL:  I appeal to the good sense of the parties in this matter, not to engage in this kind of </p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a>debate. I am sure that commonsense will prevail if you come together and sort this matter out as best as you </p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a>can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   We will endeavour to do so, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a>JUDGE MALL:   Please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	But I think you must bear in mind is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a>99</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a>what Mr Visser, as I understand him is trying to do, is to comply with the provisions of the Act which </p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a>entitle his clients to be heard, but to avoid having days and days of oral evidence by giving affidavits which </p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a>if we accept, we need not hear his clients and obviously if those affidavits conflict with what your clients </p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a>have said, then that witness will have to be heard, they cannot conflict merely by affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Well, Mr Chairman, that is one of the problems that I have got.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	Yes you will get the affidavit, if it conflicts you can ask for the witness to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a>called.  If it agrees with what your clients have said, we waste no further time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a>MR VISSER:   That is precisely correct, Mr Chairman, we are trying to help streamline the procedure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a>JUDGE MALL:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Yes, thank you.  You may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Thank you Mr Chairman, I would like to proceed with the second video.  Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a>Chairman, I don't know when the tea break would be.  If it is quarter past eleven we will not be finished </p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a>with the video I think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Alright.  We will then take the adjournment now and resume at a quarter past eleven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a>COMMITTEE RESUMES.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  We have had discussions with the legal representatives of the 81 other policemen.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a>We have received certain affidavits, I am not hundred percent sure that they are all the affidavits.  We have </p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a>not yet as far as I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a>99</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a>concerned, come to a hundred percent final arrangement in that regard. I still need to clear up one or two </p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a>points.  I must say that in principle in a discussion between my attorney and Mr Wagenaar, there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a>agreement in principal and both parties intend to work together so it is just a question of clearing up one or </p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a>two points, I just want to make that clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	Can I ask something Mr Visser, which you will have to ask your attorney I </p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a>think, that is how quickly would he be able to give us a list of persons implicated in your applications and </p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a>would he be able to give a list, this would be for our assistance and not binding, of the incidents in which </p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a>persons are involved in your applications?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a>MR VISSER:	Yes, that was the suggestion Mr Chairman, that we make a list of the incidents and then </p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a>we will add to the incidents or under the incidents the names of those of our clients who are involved in </p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a>them.   I think that is probably the way to go - or would you want us to make a list</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a>of names and add the incidents to each name, because then it is going to be far too difficult?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	No, your suggestion, but not only the names of your clients who are involved, </p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a>but the names of the persons your clients allege were implicated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a>MR VISSER:   Yes, that is a second aspect which I think could be done, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	If it could be done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a>MR VISSER:	Yes, of course that list is for the eyes of the Committee only, clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a>JUDGE MALL:	To facilitate the work of the Committee. </p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a>MR VISSER:	Oh, and His Lordship Mr Justice Wilson asked </p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a>MR VISSER	100	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a>me when this can be done, my attorney suggests that he can probably be ready with it by Thursday </p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a>morning when we have to be here anyway.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	Well, if he can, I will be very pleased.  And the list of names of persons </p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a>involved, will be for our eyes, but we may make use of it in notifying people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a>MR VISSER:   Yes, that is the idea, as long as it is not for publication purposes, it is clearly just to assist </p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a>you, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a>JUDGE MALL:	It is to facilitate the work of this Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a>MR VISSER:	Absolutely Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Thank you.  May we proceed with the video?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, before I show this video I just want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a>indicate to you the specific aspects that will be dealt with in the video itself.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a>	The first incident that will be shown is the Church Street bomb, and the bomb in the Hallmark </p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a>building in Pretoria.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a>	The second part of the video which shows the</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a>murder on the Niemand family in Pretoria.  Now that part of the video Mr Chairman, relates to normal </p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a>violence that policemen are exposed to and that would be important for purposes of the evidence of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a>psychiatrist later on as well as to give the Committee a visual general background of what policemen in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a>normal course of their duties are exposed to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a>	The third part of the video would entail pictures of murders etc, which were not politically </p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a>motivated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a>	The fourth part of the video shows the actions of crowds, necklaces, violences on innocent people </p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a>and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	101	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a>involvement of youths and activists in crowd behaviour.  This will have a political connotation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a>	The fifth part will show provocation during crowd control, which will also be of political </p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a>importance. </p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a>	The sixth part of it relates to attacks on policemen in Mamelodi and Westonaria, and that is also </p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a>important for purposes of the Zero hand grenade incident as the whole planning of that incident was borne </p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a>out of specifically attacks on policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a>	Then the next part would relate to attacks on civilians and deaths of civilians in political related </p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a>incidents.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a>	And the last part would show riots and burning of vehicles.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	 Mr Du Plessis ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	I don't want to interrupt you, but we are dealing with political related offences, we are </p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a>not dealing with extenuating circumstances.  That is what the court would deal with.  As I've already </p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a>indicated, what we see there, I don't regard it as evidence. Once it's confirmed by a witness under oath that </p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a>may be a different position.  So really what the police are doing in the ordinary prevention of crime, I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a>think that is very relevant to our task here and we don't want to be engaged in long hearings about </p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a>irrelevant things here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Yes, Mr Chairman, the video is quite short.  I think it is approximately in total </p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a>15 minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Well, let's proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Yes, Mr Chairman, I just want to make clear I intend to call Captain Hechter </p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a>thereafter to give evidence in general about what was shown and the fact that </p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a>102</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a>he was exposed to similar kinds of incidents.  Obviously we don't have video footage of incidents where </p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a>our clients were involved in to a large extent, but I will make the video relevant in evidence by way of </p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a>calling Captain Hechter to testify about what was seen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  The Chairman said you could proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   May I proceed, thank you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	Sorry, just a moment before you do that, I am not sure why you should proceed </p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a>to show us pictures which deal with incidents which have nothing to do with political issues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, the reason for that is the following.  The psychiatric evidence which </p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a>we will present to this Committee will deal specifically with the fact that policemen in the general course of </p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a>their work became exposed and that is the case today as well, become exposed to extreme violence and </p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a>extreme violent situations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a>	That causes an acceptance by such policemen of violence to the extent that serious violence </p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a>becomes something that is not so important to such a policemen as a normal person</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a>in the street, it is a psychological process which at the end of the day makes such a person somebody who </p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a>is prone to much easier or prone to acts of violence much easier because of the psychological situation he is </p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a>subjected to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a>JUDGE MALL:	I don't want to interrupt you, but please understand at the end of the evidence I have no </p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a>doubt you will be addressing us and you will be making the points that you are making now.  You are </p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a>going to call psychiatric evidence and at the end of the that evidence you will tell us what the relevance of </p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a>the evidence was at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a>So I don't think that there is any need for you to address PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a>102</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a>us on that aspect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Yes, thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I just want to make this point as well </p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a>and that is that this video was used at all educational facilities of the South African Police in courses that </p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a>policemen underwent for training.</p>

<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a>attending the course.   Some contained worse violence, some less violence, all the members of the Security </p>

<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Captain Hechter were these video's used in training of policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	 Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   And Captain Hechter, were the video's which were shown during video's of the same </p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a>nature and if you were to look back on them today, would you regard them as propaganda or what would </p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a>you regard them to be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	They were definitely propaganda, but I also have to add that most of that which </p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a>we have seen on the video's were also experienced by us, these incidents in the Black townships while </p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a>working there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Captain Hechter, can you tell the Committee from your own personal experience are </p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a>there incidents similar to what you have seen on this video that you experienced yourself and to what </p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a>extent and how regularly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	It is correct.  Mr Chairman as members of the Security Branch, myself and </p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a>colleagues experienced these things first hand and we also found that many of these violent incidents and </p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a>this violence, also affected Black</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a>colleagues of ours and affected their lives and their houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a>	On a daily basis we also found some of these people next to the road.  You would find a Black </p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a>man lying next to the road who had been murdered, either by necklacing or by stabbing.  Many of these </p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a>acts were committed by very young comrades who - these things were later determined in investigations </p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a>and we were informed of whom had been involved in the previous night's attack on a house or necklacing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Captain, these incidents and similar ones </p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	105	CAPT HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a>to what we've seen here, for example the crowd rioting, the necklacing etc, did these take place against the </p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a>political background?  Could you give us a bit more information on this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a>CAPTAIN HECHTER:	Yes, it was purely politics by the comrades, so-called comrades, which was </p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a>used by the ANC as cannon fodder, these people were used as cannon fodder by the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Okay, Captain so the effect that exposure to this kind of violence had on you and </p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a>your colleagues, could you sketch to the Committee in more detail what it was like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	Well, after a while you grew cold and distant when you saw this kind of action </p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a>and you encountered it.  It no longer really involved people, it was just another body.  In the beginning you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a>were shocked and shaking, but later on it just became just another corpse.  It left you cold.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Captain Hechter, are you aware of any instances of your colleagues who </p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a>sustained psychological damage because of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	Yes, that is correct.  There are a number of</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a>my colleagues who are at present receiving psychological treatment, many who have been under such </p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a>treatment, many who have left the police service because of psychological problems, who were medically </p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a>boarded from the service. There are numerous of them.  I would say that most of the Security Police who </p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a>took medical packages did so because of trauma and stress levels which were brought about by this kind of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a>exposure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Are you personally aware of such instances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	105	CAPT HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	 Yes, that is correct, Mr Chairman.  One of our colleagues who are sitting here </p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a>with us, Captain Mentz, is presently undergoing treatment.  The well-known Snor Vermeulen and Lionel </p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a>Snyman were both boarded because of stress related incidents or because of stress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Okay, you don't have to continue with more examples.  Captain, and can you inform </p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a>the Committee whether in the period relating to these incidents for which you are applying for amnesty, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a>when they took place in the middle 80's, could you give us a broad estimate of the regularity of exposure to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a>this kind of incident of violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	It was really on a daily basis and as at the time, the Press was totally banned </p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a>from entering the Black townships, so this kind of incident, or these incidents which kept occurring, were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a>never broadcast to the broad public in South Africa.  The public didn't really know what was going on, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a>were kept under the impression that things were under control, whereas violence was escalating on a daily </p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a>basis at a tremendous rate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Captain, are you aware of any similar kind of video of the South African Police </p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a>action which are still in existence, any of these video's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	As I told you they were training video's which I later got to understand when I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a>was trying to obtain  more of them, had been destroyed together with the documentation because the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a>instruction had been given that all video's containing this kind of violent activity had to be destroyed in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a>order to obtain better cooperation among the population groups, to bring this about and then also to show </p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a>less violence to the members who were in training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   I don't have any other questions, Mr </p>

<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a>videos were shown, I assume that it was never part of your training that you, the police should commit acts </p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a>of violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	Not at all.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a>this incident has been set out in the compilation of applications and there are further aspects which you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a>would like to inform the Committee about.  Could you just tell the Committee about them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a>CAPT MENTZ:   As I gave evidence yesterday in the incident of Brian Ngqulunga, the date which I gave </p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a>was 1987 and 1988, in the meantime I have found out it was the 19th of July 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a>	An instruction was issued by General Van Rensburg from Security Headquarters who at that stage </p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a>was in charge of</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a>unit C at Vlakplaas.  His instruction, I was not present when he issued the instruction, but it was passed on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a>by Colonel Eugene de Kock to Colonel Baker to say that Brian Ngqulunga was transferred from Vlakplaas </p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a>to Unit C2 at Security Headquarters in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a>	The instruction was that Brian Ngqulunga was to be eliminated.  Colonel de Kock gave Colonel </p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a>Dave Baker instruction to execute the instruction.  He then took myself, Colonel Bellingham, Colonel Piet </p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a>Botha and Simon Dubele instructions to execute the instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a>	The instruction which was given to me was the Ngqulunga was working at Unit C2 at Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a>Headquarters as I have already said and that from there he had secret documents and secret information </p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a>about the Security Police which he was passing onto the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a>	The impression was thus that he was a double agent.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a>The information which he was to have been leaking, was that the SAP members and their families were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a>being subjected to intimidation.  Especially the Black members, their houses were attacked and they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a>sometimes stoned and in some instances they were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a>	Reporters were identified who were intimidated and some of them were killed by being necklaced </p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a>as we saw on the video footage and the community was intimidated not to cooperate with the Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a>Police anymore and not to give them information any longer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a>	The identification of ascaris was also done and the exposure of covert operations.  Ascaris were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a>afraid that if they were identified they and their families would be murdered.  That is the information which </p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a>I received from Colonel Baker and Bellingham and that is the information</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a>which Brian Ngqulunga was alleged to have been leaking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a>	I do not have any specific knowledge of any specific incidents about which Brian Ngqulunga was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a>to have leaked information, it was conveyed to me in a general manner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a>	The instructions which we received from Colonel De Kock, as I said yesterday in my evidence, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a>were to put a spade in covert defence and defence activities.  Colonel De Kock received direct instructions </p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a>from the Commanding Structure at Security Headquarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a>	I never participated in any planning of any couvert operations, I was merely a foot soldier who </p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a>executed instructions as though they had been approved by Head Office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a>	I am now on page 55.  The operations were planned after we had agreed that Simon Radebe </p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a>would point Ngqulunga out to us at a point where we would pick him up.  I never </p>

<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a>personally knew Brian Ngqulunga.  He had already been transferred to Unit C2 from Vlakplaas before I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a>started at Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a>	A kombi was hired from Avis and balaclavas and gloves were issued to us.  Radebe was waiting </p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a>on a gravel road near Vlakplaas in a red Golf and that was the road which headed to Vlakplaas, and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a>would pass Vlakplaas, reach a T-junction and turn right.  This gravel road then led back to Attridgeville </p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a>where you met up with Church Street and then proceeded into town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a>	We approached the Golf from behind in this kombi, Colonel Baker was driving, Botha and I were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a>sitting in the middle and Bellingham was sitting in front on the left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a>We put on the balaclavas and ran to the car, we went to where Ngqulunga was sitting on the left of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a>vehicle,</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a>dragged him out of the vehicle.  We wrestled with him a bit and in the wrestling I remember very well that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a>he screamed and said, no comrades, no comrades, I am one of you, I am one of you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a>	At that stage and because we were disguised he must have thought that we were ANC members.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a>That is the conclusion which I reached.  And the conclusion was that he was still an ANC supporter </p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a>although he was an ascari with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a>	We brought him under control by manhandling him and in the process we assaulted him.  In the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a>vehicle, when we put him in the kombi we closed his mouth, we tied up his hands and feet and we went - </p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a>we drove in the direction of Brits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a>The exact place is not as shown in the footage, it is not in Soshanguve.  If you drive from Brits in the </p>

<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a>road, I do not know the name of that road, but it is somewhere in the Lehabele area.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a>	We stopped, Bellingham opened the kombi door for us and Piet Botha and I dragged him out of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a>the kombi and threw him in the field.	Bellingham fired several shots, I cannot remember how many.  To me </p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a>it sounded as though he had emptied the whole magazine on Brian Ngqulunga and killed him.  I cannot </p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a>remember, but I later heard that Piet Botha had also fired several shots at him with a pistol.  I looked away, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a>because I could not handle it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a>	When we got back into the kombi I became nauseous.  We went to a place near Pretoria North </p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a>among the plots where we cleaned the kombi inside, because Ngqulunga had urinated and so forth and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a>then cleaned up.  And from there we went to the Wonderpark Shopping Centre where we met up with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a>Johnny (Chet)(?) who had a vehicle with secret compartments.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a>	We handed the firearms that we had used to Johnny Chet who concealed them in his vehicle and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a>from there we went to the Pretoria Holiday Inn in Beatrix Street.  We met Colonel De Kock and other </p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a>members there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a>	In the process when we were driving from the scene, I know that Colonel Baker was in radio </p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a>contact with De Kock and he had informed him that the operation had gone off well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a>	I cannot remember specifically who was there, but once again it was De Kock's confidantes and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a>others.  We met him at the Holiday Inn where he ordered drinks for us.  We drank up and I cannot </p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a>remember exactly, but we went to a restaurant somewhere near there, I think it was at the Sterland </p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a>complex.   I also had something to eat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a>	Thereafter he informed us that we were booked in at a </p>

<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	110	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a>hotel in Johannesburg, if I remember correctly it was the Braamfontein Hotel and the reason for this was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a>that we would be at this hotel and if anyone was to have enquired they should have seen that we were at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a>this hotel and not elsewhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a>	This was a very shocking experience for me and it has left emotional scars on my life.  I never </p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a>ever want to become involved in anything like this again.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a>	Since receiving the instruction from De Kock and the others that Ngqulunga was an informant </p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a>and was leaking secret information from Headquarters, I accepted it, but in 1995 I read in press reports as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a>result of allegations made by Dirk Coetzee, Joe Mamasela who we saw in video footage, that Ngqulunga </p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a>was involved in the murder of Griffiths Mxenge and that he was a potential witness who could have given </p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a>evidence against Dirk Coetzee, Almond Nofomela, Brigadier van der Hoven and Colonel Andy Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a>	I also read in the press reports that Ngqulunga was one of the persons who had killed Griffiths </p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a>Mxenge - these  after allegations that had been made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a>	I then got the impression that because he had been killed and, according to what we had been told, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a>he had leaked information, one reason was possibly that it could have been used as evidence that he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a>indeed a witness and that he had to have been eliminated so that he could not testify against Coetzee and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a>van der Hoven and Nofomela and Company.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a>	The conclusion which I made, although it has never been proven to me, was if Colonel Taylor or </p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a>any of the other people involved should come and admit to it, I would say that it is also one of the reasons, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a>but those are mere PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	111	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a>assumptions which I made and I think his brother who was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a>also in a programme sometime ago, also said that he had said so, but it has never been proven to me in a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a>court of law.  I never enquired about this, I left the unit, I did not want to be there any longer, and that was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a>merely an assumption which I made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a>	I have since distanced myself from Vlakplaas and the persons who were there with me, I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a>even want to be associated with them any more.  The instruction which I received, as I said, came from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a>Colonel De Kock who instructed Baker and I assumed that it came from Colonel Van Rensburg because at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a>that stage he was in charge of Unit C1.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a>	Although I just saw that Joe Mamasela alleged that he was involved where General Engelbrecht, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a>Nick van Rensburg and I cannot remember who the other person was, were</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a>allegedly involved in the discussions.  I heard about that for the first time when I saw this.  I did not watch </p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a>the whole of Prime Evil because it disturbed me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a>	As I said I was under the impression that these operations had been sanctioned by Head Office at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a>all times and that the objective was to eliminate anyone who was leaking secret information to the ANC.  It </p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a>was also part of the strategy to combat the ANC and others and it was at a time when the country was in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a>turmoil.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a>	Ngqulunga, I cannot remember exactly how it happened, but it was arranged that he be buried at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a>Vlakplaas and his entire family was there.  It is not like where it is being said on the video footage that it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a>was an official police burial, it was more of a private burial at Vlakplaas on the mountain, the hill there as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a>shown on the footage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a>	I can remember Ngqulunga's family and friends were all </p>

<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a>present there and De Kock gave instruction that everyone was to attend the funeral.  I simply couldn't bring </p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a>myself to attend the funeral.  It was too much for me and I just couldn't be involved in somebody's funeral </p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a>whom I had assisted in murdering.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a>	While the funeral was taking place, I sat in the pub at Vlakplaas and while I was there De Kock </p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a>and Nortje came there and De Kock asked me why I was not at the cemetery and I told him that it is just </p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a>not acceptable to me, I assisted in killing this man and I just couldn't bring myself to attend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a>	I feel very bitter about this and I am every sorry that I got involved in this, but I believed at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a>time that what I was doing was in the best interests of the country and I do not believe that any longer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a>	I would now like to mention in the video footage parties were shown and it was mentioned that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a>thrice a month parties would be held at Vlakplaas - that was not the case.  	We worked for a period of two </p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a>to three weeks and thereafter we'd leave and we would come back with our group of ascaris, we would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a>submit our forms and our reports and then because we as colleagues had not seen each other for a while, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a>we'd have a braai and drink.  That is so.  And occasionally there were functions where the Generals were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a>involved, but it was not thrice a month or every month, although there were functions that were held at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a>Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a>	Vlakplaas was a unit under the command of De Kock.  There were certain logistic problems </p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a>amongst the staff and the Generals at Head Office then decided that unit C had to be divided into three </p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a>divisions.  Initially it was two divisions, Colonel Baker remained behind at Vlakplaas with </p>

<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a>his group of people and De Kock remained with his group of people including myself, and in Pretoria we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a>had our security offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a>	At the time there were problems between De Kock, myself and Colonel Van Dyk and De Kock.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a>Colonel Engelbrecht then launched a third unit and we worked from a safe house in Midrand.  There we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a>were joined by other members, including John Tait(?).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a>	There was one incident where I was present where we were in the team at Sodwana on the North </p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a>coast at the holiday resort there.  We lived in tents and Colonel Engelbrecht was there, we were on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a>beach, but we are not the persons who drove over the tortoise eggs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a>	We then went back to unit C1, Baker and - Colonel</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a>Baker's unit, De Kock's unit and Paul van Dyk's unit.  Thereafter, however, I heard that  - while I was there </p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a>there were no naked women with us.  Thereafter I heard that De Kock and his group of people from his unit </p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a>were busy with team building again and I do not know if Colonel Engelbrecht was part of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  I have a few questions which I want to ask the witness </p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a>just to clear up certain things.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a>	Captain Mentz, the instructions which you received was there any reason for you when you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a>received the instruction at that stage, to doubt the command in any way whatsoever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a>CAMP MENTZ:	No Mr Chairman.  As I had testified, I said that we had accepted De Kock, he had access </p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a>to many Generals' offices.  Every day that he was working at Head Office he had access to the Generals.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a>At that stage I wouldn't have thought that he would have taken a decision </p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	113	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a>like this on his own.  I am sure that higher authority was involved.  I cannot say exactly who the Generals </p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a>were, I've mentioned - some of them had been mentioned before.  The only reason why I imply General </p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a>Nick van Rensburg was because he was in command of C1 at that stage and I believed that it came from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a>him.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS;	Captain Mentz, now what I would like you to explain to the Committee, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a>what you had thought at the stage when you received the command and when you carried it out, what you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a>had thought the purpose of the command had been, the instruction, was it politically motivated or what did </p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a>you think?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Yes, Mr Chairman it was absolutely political in the sense that a security policeman who </p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a>was an ascari and then a security policeman at the same time, was in a</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a>confidential unit, C2, which had all the information on the country, they evaluated information and if any </p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a>information which had passed through C2 had been leaked it could affect the police, the security branches, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a>and be to the advantage of the liberation movements.	Then it was political to me and it was important to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a>me at that stage that should there be somebody who was a traitor, he had to be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a>	I didn't know at that stage how much information he had given out, but as I said many policemen's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a>houses had been burnt down, etc and it was important for me to do this.  The man had to be eliminated.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a>was passing on information and it endangered his fellow policemen's lives, so he had to be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:    Captain, during the period after the incident until you read in 1995 in the press about </p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a>the allegations that he had been murdered in order to protect </p>

<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a>other members, besides the fact that he was an informant of the ANC, did anybody ever tell you anything </p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a>that could have led you to think that he had been murdered for any other reason than being an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No, not at all Mr Chairman.  The first time I heard about this was in the newspaper and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a>later saw it on TV, it's only Ngqulunga's brother and Mamasela mentioned this, but from the time that it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a>happened until 1995 when I had left Vlakplaas long before, I hadn't discussed it with anybody, I was no </p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a>longer a security policeman.  But in the period after leaving Vlakplaas when I was still a security </p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a>policeman I never heard anything about this again.  I vaguely remember that Baker long after that said that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a>De Kock had told him that the Generals had said that the operation had been carried out successfully, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a>don't know which Generals were involved, but I deduced that it was General van Rensburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a>	At Vlakplaas, when something happened, you were forbidden to discuss it with anybody because </p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a>everybody drank there and you never knew what somebody would say if he were to be under the influence, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a>these things were never discussed again, definitely not from my side, it was something which I wanted to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a>forget about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Okay, Captain Mentz, did you regard your activity or your actions as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a>something against liberation movements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   And to whose advantage did you regard your action to be at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Well, the Government of the day Mr Chairman.  I as a policeman had to serve the </p>

<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Okay, Captain Mentz, did you have any discussions with the other persons who were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a>involved in the incident, the people whom you've mentioned, Colonel Baker, Captain Bellingham and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a>think it is Captain Botha?  Did you have discussions with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	I had Mr Chairman, but only at the end of last year when they had indicated that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a>were also submitting amnesty applications.  I can't remember the exact date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:    Could you briefly indicate to the Committee what their point of view was with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a>regard to the reason for this operation?  Did it agree, did it disagree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a>CAPT MENTZ;	It was exactly the same Mr Chairman, that the man leaked information from Security </p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a>Headquarters and it</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a>was Baker and Bellingham's instruction to me at the time as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Okay. Captain Mentz the allegations made that Ngqulunga was a potential witness, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a>where did you hear these allegations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	As I've already stated Mr Chairman, in the newspapers and Mamasela, but not that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a>which he had said here in the Prime Evil video, it was on another programme, as well as Ngqulunga's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a>brother which I saw on TV one evening.  The rest of it was in the newspapers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Are you aware that these allegations went any further as far as your knowledge goes </p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a>today than mere allegations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No, Mr Chairman.  As I've already stated Brigadier van der Hoven or Taylor, if they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a>were to come and state it here that that was the reason, then I will agree and say no, I believe it, but until </p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a>now I don't believe it </p>

<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	115	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a>Mr Chairman, because in my opinion it was a matter that he gave out information, no other facts had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a>proven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Okay. Captain Mentz then could I take you to page 55 paragraph 3, you testified </p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a>there that Ngqulunga had said "no comrades, no comrades, I'm one of you", can you remember those words </p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a>specifically being stated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Yes, Mr Chairman, I can remember that.  Not in Afrikaans, he stated it in English, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a>didn't say it, he shouted it out.  The man knew that he was possibly going to be murdered.  He was a small, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a>slender man and he struggled and he shouted these words.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Could you then just state very clearly to us why you thought he would have stated </p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a>these words, or shouted these words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Mr Chairman, I would have imagined he was an ascari who was working for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a>Security Police, he was passing on information to the ANC or to whichever liberation movement, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a>mean he would have realised that it would have been totally impossible for everybody in the liberation </p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a>movement to know about him, because then he would have been smoked out and at the stage when he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a>shouting out, I thought he wanted an opportunity to explain to the members of the ANC as he suspected, to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a>explain to them that he was still working with them.  So it was my impression that he was still involved </p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a>with the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	If he had realised he was going to be killed, surely a man under those </p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a>circumstances would have said anything to save his life?   If he had been under the impression or if he had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a>realised that you were the police, he still would have said the same thing and said people, I am working </p>

<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	I have to grant that Mr Chairman, yes. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Who were grabbing him at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a>CAPT MENTZ:   It was I myself, Piet Botha, Riaan Bellingham.  Baker was standing at the vehicle -  no I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a>can't remember whether he was standing outside or whether he was sitting in the vehicle, but Bellingham </p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a>and I and Piet Botha opened the left-hand door, hit him, grabbed him and dragged him over to the kombi, it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a>was a struggle from the Golf to the kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	You were all white men wearing balaclavas which would have left your face </p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a>exposed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a>CAPT MENTZ;	Mr Chairman, it was quite strong dusk and the balaclavas were not the balaclavas where </p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a>you have an open face, you could only see the eyes, we were wearing dark clothes and long dark gloves.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a>You wouldn't really be able to see our skin colour.  Mr Chairman, I can't really</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a>remember the exact time, but it was late afternoon when it was going onto dusk.  I can't remember, I can't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a>tell you exactly what the time was.  After five, probably six o'clock, but I can't remember the exact time, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a>but it was dusk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a>JUDGE MALL:	The instructions to eliminate this man, came to you not from De Kock himself but </p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a>through somebody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Yes, Mr Chairman if I remember correctly I was on the farm and Baker and Bellingham </p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a>came and told me.  It didn't come from De Kock directly to me as far as I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Have you finished Mr du Plessis?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a>Nofomela at some stage or were you</p>

<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a>involved in the arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Almond Nofomela, yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Is that when you were working at the murder division?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	And you were then recruited to go over to Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	During his arrest, did you receive information regarding the functioning of Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No Mr Chairman, as a matter of fact I didn't even know of the existence of Vlakplaas </p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a>when I was working at the murder division.  It was after I had first arrested Nofomela's co-accused Johnny </p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a>Mohane if I remember correctly, it was only after that when he had been arrested that</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a>evening, that he made an admission to me that he had implied Almond Nofomela ...(tape ends) I made </p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a>enquiries then and said that we were looking for the man and then Almond Nofomela was sent from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a>Headquarters to my office and when he arrived there, I arrested him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Was there at any stage an effort made to cover up Nofomela's deed at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No Mr Chairman.  If I remember correctly during the investigation the deduction was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a>made and it came out in the hearing as well, the trial, that there had not been adequate evidence against </p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a>Nofomela, but I remember on the last day of the trial when the finding was given, some of the ascaris were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a>sitting in court.  I have since heard at that stage of Vlakplaas that they tracked terrorists etc, and on the day </p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a>some of his fellow colleagues were sitting there in court.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Was that the first time during those episodes that you met Eugene De Kock himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No sir.  De Kock was at the murder division offices long before and that was when I met </p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a>him, he was still a Captain at this stage, not a Major.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	So your arrest of Nofomela had nothing to do with the fact that you were going to work </p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a>at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No, Mr Chairman, I would say that at that stage I got to know Vlakplaas members and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a>they got to know me.  We often met at the police canteen in Pretoria and there I got to know them better, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a>and they approached me to find out whether I would be interested in coming to work with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV DE JAGER.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a>QUESTIONS BY MS KHAMPEPE:   Didn't you testify</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a>yesterday that before you were attached to Vlakplaas Mr Hechter occasionally extended an invitation to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a>you to join them on some of the operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	That's correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	So you must have known at that stage what kind of operations Vlakplaas was involved </p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a>in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	When I was contacted by Captain Hechter, he was not attached to Vlakplaas, he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a>with Brigadier Cronje at Pretoria, they had nothing to do with Vlakplaas at the stage.  He was just working </p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a>with the Pretoria branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	Thanks for the explanation. You've also led evidence today that the experience that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a>had when Mr Ngqulunga was brutally killed, was very shocking to you and it has left emotional scars?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	That's correct Chairperson.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	Now, before you went on to execute the instructions to eliminate Mr Ngqulunga, had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a>you discussed as members who had been picked up by, is it Colonel Dave Baker on how those instructions </p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a>to eliminate Mr Ngqulunga were to be executed, did you discuss the mode of execution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No Chairman, we did not discuss it with Colonel Van Dyk.  As I say it was an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a>instruction and I assumed it was an instruction from Head Office and it was something that had to be done.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a>I did not ask why they did not arrest him instead or anything like that.  I just did it at that stage, because it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a>was something that had to have been done.  It is a good few years ago and these things started affecting me </p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a>very seriously in the last four to five years.	Nobody said he had to be kidnapped along the way and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a>killed with an AK47, I did not, I mean those were the instructions, I did not ask why it had to be done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	 My question was to merely ascertain whether you knew what kind of method would be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a>used in eliminating Mr Ngqulunga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Yes, we did know.  As I said it was said that Botha and I had to overpower him with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a>assistance of Bellingham, we had to take him away and then Bellingham was to have shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a>	As I also said I cannot remember specifically about Piet Botha shooting him, but it is something </p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a>that surfaced recently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	You did expect some measure of violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	Which would be a precursor to any elimination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	I have therefore some profound difficulties in comprehending how you could have, how </p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a>you could not have known that Ngqulunga would be eliminated in the manner that he was.  I mean what </p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a>was so shocking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Mr Chairman, it is easy when it is said to you go and do a certain gruesome deed, but if I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a>may use the expression, at the stage, at 99th stage, at the last minute when it is to happen, it is too late, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a>are at a point of no return, you function like a machine and when the deed has been done you start to think </p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a>about what actually happened and as I say I did not physically vomit, but I was extremely nauseous in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a>kombi and my nerves were shattered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a>	It is easy to say we are going to do this, but when you get there and while it is happening, while </p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a>the deed is taking place or after it has happened the full impact of what you had done, strikes you and at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a>that stage I thought I could deal with it, but I mean if I had to go out and do something like that at this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a>stage, I wouldn't be able to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a>MS KHAMPEPE;	Can you explain to us the nature and the extent of your participation in the whole </p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a>operation?   I mean you've explained that when he was dragged out of the car, you assaulted him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a>grabbed him around his neck, around his body, we shut his mouth, we hit him.  In the process trying to get </p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a>him unconscious so that he did not put up as much of a fight, so he was physically assaulted, we had him </p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a>around the neck, we dragged him, somebody had his feet and in the kombi, one person was to have stuffed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a>something in his mouth and then sealed it and also tied his hands.  He was assaulted.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Three of us, myself, Bellingham and Piet Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a>ADV MPSHE:	And for how long did the assault take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Mr Chairperson, I cannot attach a time to it, I think it was, everything happened so </p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a>quickly, it could</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a>have been a matter of a minute getting him from the car to the kombi, it was seven to ten metres, we took  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a>him from the - grabbed him out of the vehicle and first he was on the ground so that we could bring him </p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a>under control by assaulting him and then we picked him up and ran to the kombi.  The door was open, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a>seat was down, we put him at the back and then we were able to tie his hands.	Everything happened </p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a>so fast.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a>ADV MPSHE:	....if it took such a short time and the man was rendered unconscious, it would mean that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a>he was delivered quite a number of blows, and very hard blows that made him be unconscious very </p>

<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	25 to 30, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a>ADV MPSHE:	If we assume that it had 25 at the time, would it mean that he was pumped with 25 </p>

<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Mr Chairperson, Bellingham was firing this firearm automatically so it was impossible </p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a>to count and to me it sounded as if the entire magazine had been emptied.  It happened too fast, I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a>unable to count.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Two shots, even one from an AK47 have rendered this man dead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Yes, Sir it would have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a>ADV MPSHE:	You were part of this operation, do you think it was necessary for 25 bullets to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a>pumped into his body?  Was this not an extreme?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Yes, Chairperson, it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a>ADV MPSHE:	After shooting him, you wrote in your</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a>application that "we left him there and drove back", where exactly did you leave him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Where we threw him out of the kombi, where he was shot dead, that is where we left </p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a>him and we then left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a>ADV MPSHE:	How did it come about that he landed at Vlakplaas for the funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Mr Chairperson, the local police of Lehabele or someone in the area was - apparently </p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a>encountered the corpse and informed the police who came in a hearse and picked up the corpse, identified </p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a>it.  His family and next of kin were then informed that this was a policeman, an ascari and the funeral was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a>conducted at Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a>ADV MPSHE:	So when he was identified by the local police and the family, you then came around and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a>shed crocodile tears and claimed his body to bury?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE	122	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No Mr Chairman, I cannot remember exactly, but I think there were riots.  I think he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a>stayed somewhere in Winterveld, which was on the other side of Pretoria, somewhere near Soshanguve </p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a>and Mabopane.  If I can remember correctly there were riots and unrest and I think it would have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a>problematic to bury the man there at the time, so the police offered and then De Kock said he had no </p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a>objection to him being buried at Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Do you want this Committee to accept that you acted on instruction, agreed to partake in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a>the killing of a human being for reasons given to you without yourself verifying whether it was necessary </p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a>to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	As I already testified I believed that the instruction came from Head Office, I believed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a>that the gentleman who was leaking information was a traitor and as I already said we were not, I believed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a>that, we didn't question anything, I believed that the instructions came</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a>from Head Office, I was merely a Warrant Officer at the time and I was in no position to go to a General's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a>office at Head Office and say give me proof that this man has been leaking information before I do </p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a>anything.  It just didn't work like that in the police system.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a>ADV MPSHE:	So if you were given any information and instruction by your seniors to kill, you just go </p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a>about killing?  Is that what was happening there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a>ADV MPSHE:	And was the family informed as to what caused Brian Ngqulunga's death when they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a>attended his funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No Mr Chairperson, the impression was to have been created that the ANC, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a>think he was an ANC or PAC member, I am not too familiar with that, that the liberation PRETORIA </p>

<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a>movement because he was an ascari, had killed him.  The impression was to have been created that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a>ANC or PAC had killed this man because he was an ascari in the Security Police.	It was never said that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a>he was killed for any other reason, it wouldn't have made sense.  The police never said that we killed an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a>ascari because he was leaking information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a>ADV MPSHE:	You stated, when led by your counsel, that the purpose of instruction was politically </p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a>motivated, but was the death of this man politically motivated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Yes Mr Chairman.  As I've already testified  he was a freedom fighter who had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a>arrested, who had been turned into an ascari, who had decided to work with the police which he had indeed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a>then done.  He had been transferred from Vlakplaas to Headquarters at C2.	The reasons for this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a>and the period when this happened, I don't know, but then he worked for a unit where there were</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a>very sensitive information and documentation and if he had been leaking this information to ANC, PAC </p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a>whichever liberation organisation, this turned him into a political problem.  He was affecting the National </p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a>Party by working for these other parties and for the police on the one hand and for example, the ANC on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a>the other hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a>	He had sensitive information, policemen's houses were burnt down, we've heard much testimony </p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a>to this effect, people were attacked when people found out that somebody was an informant.  When </p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a>informers were exposed, they were necklaced, they were burnt, their throats were cut, they were shot, their </p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a>families were attacked, so he was - he just had to be eliminated.  You couldn't charge the man and take him </p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a>to court because what proof was there, I was not in a position to question this.  The thing to eliminate him, </p>

<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a>you say that this had to be done, it was not my position to do this.  I was a foot soldier, I had to carry out </p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a>my task, I believed it.  It was part of the political struggle of keeping the National Party in control.  As a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a>policeman I had to support the Government of the day, that was my job.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a>had been necklaced, I don't know</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a>about specific incidents, but I accepted that the seniors had ascertained this, had obtained the necessary </p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a>information and had given us the instruction.  I couldn't go and determine that myself, I don't know of </p>

<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Mr Chairman, I didn't regard it as general information.  I saw it and I believed that it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a>an instruction that came from my seniors who wouldn't have said this man had bothered me, he needs to be </p>

<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a>	There is agreement between what Mamasela said and what I say here and what is said on TV and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a>in the press articles, but it is a deduction that I make, but I am still convinced that the main reason was that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1582"><a name="pos1582"></a>he had been leaking information and this was just something that had become an additional factor, I didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a>know about this beforehand at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a>ADV MPSHE:	But what I am trying to make out to you, is that Brian Ngqulunga did not die because of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a>his being an informer for the ANC, but he died because the police force was afraid that he was going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a>break down and spill the beans at the Harms Commission, that's all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Mr Chairman, I don't know anything about it, I don't have any knowledge about it.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a>These are things that I've heard about afterwards, after the fact and which I had testified about before the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a>Committee.	I can't say that this is the case, these things have to be proven, the specific facts haven't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a>been proven, the fact that he is a witness before the Harms Commission, I don't in my application, I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a>think the Harms Commission was even mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a>ADV MPSHE:	The family would like to know as to who erected a tombstone on Ngqulunga's grave, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a>because they did not do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	It came from police funds.  I don't know specifically which fund, it was probably the </p>

<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a>ADV MPSHE:   But the money came from the police fund to buy a tombstone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No, I didn't.  Yes, I had heard that the tombstone was to be erected, I don't know </p>

<p class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Can you distinguish the shots if it is fired on automatic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	If you have a very finely tuned ear and if  you are used to shooting a lot with the firearm, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a>you could probably distinguish, but I can't tell you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1625"><a name="pos1625"></a>were various events for which you applied for amnesty.  I think purely, briefly for the sake of the questions </p>
<p class="line" id="line1626"><a name="pos1626"></a>put to you, we have to refer to this, the event with regard to the KwaNdebele Nine, were you physically </p>

<p class="line" id="line1628"><a name="pos1628"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No, Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1631"><a name="pos1631"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	And the events at Khan House?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1632"><a name="pos1632"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No, I did surround protection, I wasn't at the premises, I wasn't present in the house </p>
<p class="line" id="line1633"><a name="pos1633"></a>myself, I was not near the building.  I was told to go and look out from a certain point that people from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1634"><a name="pos1634"></a>houses say in the area would approach the place when we were busy there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1635"><a name="pos1635"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	You were not involved in the physical death of the people, you were not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1636"><a name="pos1636"></a>present there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1637"><a name="pos1637"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1638"><a name="pos1638"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	And with regard to the Komatipoort Four, were you present when those people </p>
<p class="line" id="line1639"><a name="pos1639"></a>were shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1640"><a name="pos1640"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1641"><a name="pos1641"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Okay.  Now Captain Mentz, the only two events with regard to which you ask </p>
<p class="line" id="line1642"><a name="pos1642"></a>for amnesty contained in your application where you were present when the people were killed, were Brian </p>
<p class="line" id="line1643"><a name="pos1643"></a>Ngqulunga and the event at Pentz Mine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1644"><a name="pos1644"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1645"><a name="pos1645"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	May I take you to page 108 of this compilation of documents.  108, second </p>

<p class="line" id="line1649"><a name="pos1649"></a>the application regarding Pentz Mine, I don't want to go into this in detail, I just wish you to read to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1650"><a name="pos1650"></a>Committee the second paragraph on page 108 about how you felt after the person had been shot at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1651"><a name="pos1651"></a>Pentz Mine event.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1652"><a name="pos1652"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	I became nauseous again Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1653"><a name="pos1653"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Could you read to us this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1654"><a name="pos1654"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	"While we were walking back, I became nauseous, I was walking at the back.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1655"><a name="pos1655"></a>Everything that had happened there, was totally unacceptable to me and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1656"><a name="pos1656"></a>couldn't identify with it at all".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1657"><a name="pos1657"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	That is page 108.  Now Captain Mentz, in the case of this Pentz Mine incident, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1658"><a name="pos1658"></a>were you physically at all involved in the person's death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1659"><a name="pos1659"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No Mr Chairman I was in the background.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1660"><a name="pos1660"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Did you see his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1661"><a name="pos1661"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	When I saw he was going to be shot, I looked away and you can see that in the rest of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1662"><a name="pos1662"></a>my testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1663"><a name="pos1663"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	So you didn't see his actual death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1664"><a name="pos1664"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No, I didn't see anything about the explosion, I didn't touch the man, I didn't handle him </p>
<p class="line" id="line1665"><a name="pos1665"></a>physically.  At that stage I was just De Kock's motor car</p>
<p class="line" id="line1666"><a name="pos1666"></a>driver, the person wasn't even in the same car with us or anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1667"><a name="pos1667"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Okay, Captain Mentz, so the only event for which you apply for amnesty </p>
<p class="line" id="line1668"><a name="pos1668"></a>where you were physically involved in the death of a person, the case of Brian Ngqulunga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1669"><a name="pos1669"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Yes, Mr Chairman.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1670"><a name="pos1670"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	How was he physically involved - he stood there and looked, he took no part in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1671"><a name="pos1671"></a>the death, did he?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1673"><a name="pos1673"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	129	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1674"><a name="pos1674"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Mnr die Voorsitter, ek sal die vrae vrae.  Captain Mentz were those the only </p>
<p class="line" id="line1675"><a name="pos1675"></a>events where you were in physical contact with the person by way of the assault before he was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1676"><a name="pos1676"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1677"><a name="pos1677"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	And was that the only event where you really saw that the person was shot </p>
<p class="line" id="line1678"><a name="pos1678"></a>before your eyes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1679"><a name="pos1679"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1680"><a name="pos1680"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Okay.  Now against that background, Captain Mentz, would you possibly from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1681"><a name="pos1681"></a>these facts be able to give an explanation to the Committee as to why you reacted in such an emotional </p>
<p class="line" id="line1682"><a name="pos1682"></a>manner to the death of Brian Ngqulunga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1683"><a name="pos1683"></a>	Captain, okay let me restate the question.  Would the fact that you were so closely involved in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1684"><a name="pos1684"></a>death of Brian Ngqulunga not perhaps have caused you to be more emotional with regard to that event than </p>
<p class="line" id="line1685"><a name="pos1685"></a>in the case of others where you were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1686"><a name="pos1686"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	That is possible Mr Chairman, but as I've already stated psychiatrists etc can be called in.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line1687"><a name="pos1687"></a>I can't explain why I feel like this or like that from time to time, we don't feel the same every morning we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1688"><a name="pos1688"></a>get up.  	These are terrible things that happened and it affects one in different manners.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1689"><a name="pos1689"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Mr du Plessis really, why are you putting this man through such a lot of trouble, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1690"><a name="pos1690"></a>mean what is the weighty point that you are making here?  I mean you kill somebody, somebody is killed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1691"><a name="pos1691"></a>in front of you in a very barbarous way,  I mean it must just trouble him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1692"><a name="pos1692"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Yes, clearly Mr Chairman, but certain questions were asked to the witness, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1693"><a name="pos1693"></a>reasons whereof I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1694"><a name="pos1694"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1695"><a name="pos1695"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	129	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line1696"><a name="pos1696"></a>am not hundred percent sure, but what I would want to address the Committee on during argument, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1697"><a name="pos1697"></a>that is why I am asking this question is the fact that Captain Mentz, and it all simply go to probabilities, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1698"><a name="pos1698"></a>Captain Mentz did not react differently in the case of Brian Ngqulunga because of the possible fact that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1699"><a name="pos1699"></a>knew he was killing in innocent man, not for political motives, but simply to exterminate him as a witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1700"><a name="pos1700"></a>	It all goes towards probabilities.  Mr Chairman, I see it is past one o'clock already, I have a few </p>
<p class="line" id="line1701"><a name="pos1701"></a>other questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1702"><a name="pos1702"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Shouldn't we finish it if you have those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1703"><a name="pos1703"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	If you will allow me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1704"><a name="pos1704"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Yes, I think we should get done with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1705"><a name="pos1705"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Captain Mentz, I just wish to clarify one matter.  It was asked when you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1706"><a name="pos1706"></a>contacted by Captain Hechter, whether you hadn't been involved in Vlakplaas, can you explain to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1707"><a name="pos1707"></a>Committee briefly the stage when you were contacted in the case of the KwaNdebele Nine for example by </p>
<p class="line" id="line1708"><a name="pos1708"></a>Captain Hechter, was Colonel De Kock at that stage still there, in 1988 and was Captain Hechter involved </p>
<p class="line" id="line1709"><a name="pos1709"></a>at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1710"><a name="pos1710"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No Sir, both cases, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1711"><a name="pos1711"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Very well Captain Mentz, was there any</p>
<p class="line" id="line1712"><a name="pos1712"></a>incident where an instruction such as this, where you just assumed it was a normal instruction like this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1713"><a name="pos1713"></a>would you have questioned it in the past?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1714"><a name="pos1714"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1715"><a name="pos1715"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Are you aware of instances where policemen, especially at the time, questioned </p>
<p class="line" id="line1716"><a name="pos1716"></a>these type of instructions?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1719"><a name="pos1719"></a>It was never done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1720"><a name="pos1720"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	What would have happened to you if you were to started questioning </p>
<p class="line" id="line1721"><a name="pos1721"></a>instructions or questioning people senior to Eugene de Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1722"><a name="pos1722"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	We all know about Eugene de Kock, I would have been seen as a traitor at that stage and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1723"><a name="pos1723"></a>anything could have happened.  I would definitely have been transferred to a place not of my choice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1724"><a name="pos1724"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	If you had questioned such an instruction in the South African police context </p>
<p class="line" id="line1725"><a name="pos1725"></a>and in the Security Police context, would they have taken steps against you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1726"><a name="pos1726"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1727"><a name="pos1727"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Very well Captain Mentz, I will present this evidence through one of the other </p>
<p class="line" id="line1728"><a name="pos1728"></a>witnesses, but I am going to put it to you would you be able to dispute it if I put to you that an AK47 can </p>
<p class="line" id="line1729"><a name="pos1729"></a>fire approximately 75 rounds per minute?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1730"><a name="pos1730"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	I cannot dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1731"><a name="pos1731"></a>MR MPSHE:	 Mr Chairman, Sir, may I be allowed just to put one question which I omitted, to the </p>

<p class="line" id="line1743"><a name="pos1743"></a>had been closed with something, I do not know if anything was stuffed into his mouth, I know that his </p>
<p class="line" id="line1744"><a name="pos1744"></a>mouth had been closed with something, something had been placed over his mouth.  I had more to do with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1745"><a name="pos1745"></a>his arms, bringing his arms under control.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1746"><a name="pos1746"></a>ADV MPSHE:	With what was the mouth taped closed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1747"><a name="pos1747"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	With sellotape, coloured sellotape, I cannot remember what colour the sellotape was, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line1748"><a name="pos1748"></a>it was this very strong type of sellotape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1749"><a name="pos1749"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Is it possible that before his mouth had been taped closed that something had been </p>

<p class="line" id="line1787"><a name="pos1787"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	When we went to the funeral, it was a Saturday afternoon, when we were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1788"><a name="pos1788"></a>approaching the graveside, we met the comrades, the comrade group and the group said we won't bury the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1789"><a name="pos1789"></a>corpse there and suddenly there were attacks and they started shooting and we took one of the injured ones </p>
<p class="line" id="line1790"><a name="pos1790"></a>to the mortuary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1791"><a name="pos1791"></a>	On Monday Captain Van Dyk came. ...(intervention)</p>

<p class="line" id="line1793"><a name="pos1793"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	It took place just when we were taking - gaining entrance to the graveside </p>
<p class="line" id="line1794"><a name="pos1794"></a>...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1795"><a name="pos1795"></a>ADV MPSHE:   Which graveyard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1796"><a name="pos1796"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:   Soshanguve graveyard.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line1798"><a name="pos1798"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:   We went back, was taken back to the mortuary Saturday afternoon. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1799"><a name="pos1799"></a>	On Monday Captain Van Dyk came and said Eugene de Kock had said there is a conducive place </p>
<p class="line" id="line1800"><a name="pos1800"></a>in Vlakplaas where Brian could be buried, so he might as well be taken there. Although we did not even </p>
<p class="line" id="line1801"><a name="pos1801"></a>know the causes of his killing, but we agreed to the fact that he should be buried in Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1802"><a name="pos1802"></a>	And on Wednesday we were four of us headed to Vlakplaas and some others from Vlakplaas </p>
<p class="line" id="line1803"><a name="pos1803"></a>were present.  We buried him on Wednesday.  When we got there, I found that there was no conducive </p>
<p class="line" id="line1804"><a name="pos1804"></a>place whatsoever, it was just a forest where we were going to bury him.	I did not even have an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1805"><a name="pos1805"></a>opportunity to ask him where is the conducive place that you were </p>

<p class="line" id="line1807"><a name="pos1807"></a>ADV MPSHE	134	T C NGQULUNGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1808"><a name="pos1808"></a>talking about because what I am seeing here is a hill and it is just a forest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1809"><a name="pos1809"></a>	And we finished the whole service and we went back home, though we did not know who the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1810"><a name="pos1810"></a>perpetrators were.  I was just told that he was killed by ANC when I tried to enquire next to Brits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1811"><a name="pos1811"></a>	The second thing I think when they killed Brian, he was naked, they had taken off his clothes, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1812"><a name="pos1812"></a>way he was brutally injured, because the clothes he had on, he had a suit, a black suit on.  Brian's body was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1813"><a name="pos1813"></a>brutally injured and his clothes were just intact, they were in perfect condition.  The shirt and the suit were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1814"><a name="pos1814"></a>clean as ever, no blood whatsoever.  I think they had taken off his clothes and they put the clothes back </p>
<p class="line" id="line1815"><a name="pos1815"></a>after they had injured him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1816"><a name="pos1816"></a>ADV MPSHE:	You did hear the evidence that he was buried, or he had to be buried at Vlakplaas </p>
<p class="line" id="line1817"><a name="pos1817"></a>because there was rioting going on in the Soshanguve township, did you hear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1818"><a name="pos1818"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	Yes, we had heard that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1819"><a name="pos1819"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Was there any violence going on at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1820"><a name="pos1820"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	There was no riot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1821"><a name="pos1821"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Were you ever informed about the tombstone that was laid on his grave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1822"><a name="pos1822"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	I was not informed, I was just told that they had already erected a tombstone </p>
<p class="line" id="line1823"><a name="pos1823"></a>and I was taken to see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1824"><a name="pos1824"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Were you given any information as to who laid the tombstone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1825"><a name="pos1825"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	No one gave me any information regarding this, I was just fetched to Brian's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1826"><a name="pos1826"></a>grave to see the tombstone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1827"><a name="pos1827"></a>ADV MPSHE:	If you do have knowledge was Brian involved </p>
<p class="line" id="line1828"><a name="pos1828"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1829"><a name="pos1829"></a>ADV MPSHE	134	T C NGQULUNGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1830"><a name="pos1830"></a>with the ANC Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1831"><a name="pos1831"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	No, I don't have any knowledge in that regard.  He never made mention of that.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1832"><a name="pos1832"></a>All I knew is that he was a police, working with the police.  The only thing he said to me was that he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1833"><a name="pos1833"></a>no longer happy at work, because he had received threatening calls, that he should tell his White employers </p>
<p class="line" id="line1834"><a name="pos1834"></a>to put everything in place, his records so</p>
<p class="line" id="line1835"><a name="pos1835"></a>that when he dies, the families were taken care of.  And when he had tried to ask who are you talking to me </p>
<p class="line" id="line1836"><a name="pos1836"></a>in this fashion, they refused to tell him the names.  The following day he moved from one office to another </p>
<p class="line" id="line1837"><a name="pos1837"></a>and the same phone rang and he was told that - the same message that, tell your employers to give you all </p>
<p class="line" id="line1838"><a name="pos1838"></a>your monies because you will die very soon and you will see us soon to kill you.  That means he saw them, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1839"><a name="pos1839"></a>he met the people on Friday when he was killed, the very people that threatened him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1840"><a name="pos1840"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Did he perhaps tell you why there were these death threats?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1841"><a name="pos1841"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	He did not tell me anything, he only told me that he was no longer happy at his </p>
<p class="line" id="line1842"><a name="pos1842"></a>workplace.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1843"><a name="pos1843"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Evidence was led, sorry Mr Chairman, I withdraw that, no evidence was led to it in fact, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1844"><a name="pos1844"></a>but it was shown on the TV today which video you saw, that Mamasela stated that your husband was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1845"><a name="pos1845"></a>drinking a lot, that he was broken down and at one stage he even shot at you, do you remember hearing </p>
<p class="line" id="line1846"><a name="pos1846"></a>that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1847"><a name="pos1847"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1848"><a name="pos1848"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Did you know as to why he had to shoot you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1849"><a name="pos1849"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	That is a family matter, all that I know is that because Joe Mamasela had said </p>
<p class="line" id="line1850"><a name="pos1850"></a>he drank very heavily, I repudiate that, he will only drink Saturdays and Sundays and PRETORIA </p>
<p class="line" id="line1851"><a name="pos1851"></a>HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1852"><a name="pos1852"></a>ADV MPSHE	135	T C NGQULUNGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1853"><a name="pos1853"></a>still he was not a heavy drinker and he was also registered with Unisa, he had no time to drink as Joe </p>
<p class="line" id="line1854"><a name="pos1854"></a>Mamasela alleged</p>
<p class="line" id="line1855"><a name="pos1855"></a>What he did to me was just a mistake and it has nothing to do with this, it is all a family matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1856"><a name="pos1856"></a>ADV MPSHE:	What was he studying with Unisa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1857"><a name="pos1857"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	He was studying law with Unisa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1858"><a name="pos1858"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Studying towards a law degree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1859"><a name="pos1859"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1860"><a name="pos1860"></a>ADV MPSHE:    Now the applicant is before this Committee, seeking amnesty, what is your response to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1861"><a name="pos1861"></a>that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1862"><a name="pos1862"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	It is hard, it is difficult.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1863"><a name="pos1863"></a>ADV MPSHE:	He is basically, amongst others, asking for forgiveness, how do you react to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1864"><a name="pos1864"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	(No audible reply)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1865"><a name="pos1865"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Mr Mpshe if she doesn't want to answer that it....</p>
<p class="line" id="line1866"><a name="pos1866"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Thank you Mr Chairman, that will be all the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1867"><a name="pos1867"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Has it been explained to her Mr Mpshe, as to what is meant by amnesty and so on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1868"><a name="pos1868"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Yes, Mr Chairman, that has been done, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1869"><a name="pos1869"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Yes.  Is the position that she hasn't answered what her attitude is towards the granting of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1870"><a name="pos1870"></a>amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1871"><a name="pos1871"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Yes, Mr Chairman this has been explained, but perhaps I am not speaking for her Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1872"><a name="pos1872"></a>Chairman, as I look at her she is becoming emotional, perhaps it is because of that that she cannot say how </p>
<p class="line" id="line1873"><a name="pos1873"></a>she feels about it Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1874"><a name="pos1874"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Let her calm down and afford her an opportunity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1875"><a name="pos1875"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Are you ready to come and comment on the </p>

<p class="line" id="line1879"><a name="pos1879"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	I don't have any forgiveness, I have no forgiveness for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1880"><a name="pos1880"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Thank you Mr Chairman that will be all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1881"><a name="pos1881"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1882"><a name="pos1882"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Mr Mpshe has it been explained to her that if she is in need of assistance which might </p>
<p class="line" id="line1883"><a name="pos1883"></a>become available through the Reparation and Rehabilitation Commission, that she should approach them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1884"><a name="pos1884"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Yes, Mr Chairman, that was done to her and her two sisters by myself, yesterday and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1885"><a name="pos1885"></a>which discussion went down to the question of exhuming the body and burying him where they want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1886"><a name="pos1886"></a>bury him and I referred - connected her with the gentlemen next to him who is from the R&amp;R Committee, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1887"><a name="pos1887"></a>that has been taken care of by him, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1888"><a name="pos1888"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Thank you.  Are there any questions to be asked under cross-examination?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1895"><a name="pos1895"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Mr du Plessis, I am sure you don't intend asking that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1896"><a name="pos1896"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	I am just trying to determine whether the clothing was the clothing he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1897"><a name="pos1897"></a>wearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1898"><a name="pos1898"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	So you are asking the question whether he had PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1899"><a name="pos1899"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	137	T C NGQULUNGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1900"><a name="pos1900"></a>dressed for his burial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1901"><a name="pos1901"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	No, what I mean is had he dressed for the burial in different clothes than those </p>
<p class="line" id="line1902"><a name="pos1902"></a>which he had been wearing?  Okay, let me rephrase the question. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1903"><a name="pos1903"></a>	The clothing which you are testifying about, was that the clothing he was dressed in for the burial </p>
<p class="line" id="line1904"><a name="pos1904"></a>or was it clothing that was sent to you in a different manner, which clothes are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1905"><a name="pos1905"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	I am talking about the suit that he had on on Friday when he was going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1906"><a name="pos1906"></a>work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1907"><a name="pos1907"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Was he dressed in that particular suit of clothes when he was buried?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1908"><a name="pos1908"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	We burnt the other suit and we put on a different suit altogether.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1909"><a name="pos1909"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	The suit which you burnt, were these the clothes which he had on when he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1910"><a name="pos1910"></a>shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1911"><a name="pos1911"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	That was the suit that he had on when he was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1912"><a name="pos1912"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Thank you very much.  I have one more question.  Do you know who made the </p>

<p class="line" id="line1914"><a name="pos1914"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	I don't know, because he also did not know, he also wanted to know.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1928"><a name="pos1928"></a>came and Engelbrecht to tell me that Brian was killed and he is in the mortuary.  When I asked as to what </p>

<p class="line" id="line1931"><a name="pos1931"></a>mortuary where I located him and no one could stand firmly and look at him because he was brutally </p>
<p class="line" id="line1932"><a name="pos1932"></a>injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1933"><a name="pos1933"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	Did he have no clothes on then, on the Monday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1934"><a name="pos1934"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	He was covered with a sheet and we only saw his head because it was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1935"><a name="pos1935"></a>covered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1936"><a name="pos1936"></a>JUDGE WILSON;	When did you next see him, his body dressed in these clothes that you've told </p>
<p class="line" id="line1937"><a name="pos1937"></a>us about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1938"><a name="pos1938"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	We clothed him on Friday evening, he was naked and that was after the post-</p>

<p class="line" id="line1940"><a name="pos1940"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	Would you know what had happened to his clothes, they were given back to </p>

<p class="line" id="line1942"><a name="pos1942"></a>MS NGQULUNGA:	Yes, I was given the clothes after the funeral.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1943"><a name="pos1943"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	Those are the clothes he had been wearing, not the clothes he was buried in?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1945"><a name="pos1945"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	These clothes you were given were undamaged, perfectly clean, is that what </p>

<p class="line" id="line1969"><a name="pos1969"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Mr Mpshe, in this post-mortem report there is a reference to annexure A - I haven't got a </p>

<p class="line" id="line1977"><a name="pos1977"></a>make hundred percent sure about that.  Would it be possible for me to recall Captain Mentz just to testify </p>
<p class="line" id="line1978"><a name="pos1978"></a>about one aspect that flows from the evidence of this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1979"><a name="pos1979"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Is it in connection with the Scheepers Morudi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1980"><a name="pos1980"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	No, Mr Chairman in connection with the previous matter, in connection with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1981"><a name="pos1981"></a>Brian Ngqulunga.  I beg your pardon Mr Chairman, it is something that I just want to make hundred </p>
<p class="line" id="line1982"><a name="pos1982"></a>percent clear that that evidence I cannot </p>
<p class="line" id="line1983"><a name="pos1983"></a>recall that the witness gave that specific piece of evidence</p>
<p class="line" id="line1984"><a name="pos1984"></a>and I deem it important after the questions which have been asked now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1985"><a name="pos1985"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Well, you may call him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1986"><a name="pos1986"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1989"><a name="pos1989"></a>aspect which I would like to clarify with you, did you specifically see when Mr Ngqulunga was shot, did </p>
<p class="line" id="line1990"><a name="pos1990"></a>you see that yourself specifically, when Captain Bellingham shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1991"><a name="pos1991"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Mr Chairman, yes, if I remember correctly he was shot in the head.  I can remember </p>
<p class="line" id="line1992"><a name="pos1992"></a>vaguely there was something said that they wouldn't have to recognise him by his face because they could </p>
<p class="line" id="line1993"><a name="pos1993"></a>look at his fingerprints, but his identification had to be delayed.  I think the magazine was emptied on his </p>
<p class="line" id="line1994"><a name="pos1994"></a>head, I am not sure whether Piet Botha also shot him with a pistol, but that could be so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1995"><a name="pos1995"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Thank you Mr Chairman, that is the only question that I had.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2004"><a name="pos2004"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	I notice from the post-mortem report that he had fractured first to third ribs on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2005"><a name="pos2005"></a>both sides of the body and of both clavicles, could this have been caused by the assault you and the others </p>
<p class="line" id="line2006"><a name="pos2006"></a>launched onto him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2007"><a name="pos2007"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	It could be so Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2008"><a name="pos2008"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	And he had a collapsed lung and a</p>
<p class="line" id="line2009"><a name="pos2009"></a>lacerated upper lobe of the left lung, a ruptured heart, could this all have been a result of your assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2010"><a name="pos2010"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Mr Chairman, when he was lying in the back of the vehicle, we sat on top of him.  I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line2011"><a name="pos2011"></a>not a medical officer, but I, it is quite possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2012"><a name="pos2012"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	Ruptured small intestines, ruptured bladder, is this also all possible as a result </p>
<p class="line" id="line2013"><a name="pos2013"></a>of your assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2014"><a name="pos2014"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	It is possible Mr Chairman.  As I told you we sat on him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2015"><a name="pos2015"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	 From my experience of post mortems there was considerably more done to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2016"><a name="pos2016"></a>body than sitting on it to have caused all these injuries. You can't comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2017"><a name="pos2017"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman the witness wanted to answer the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2018"><a name="pos2018"></a>JUDGE MALL:   Yes please allow him to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2019"><a name="pos2019"></a>CAPT MENTZ:	Mr Chairman, as I've already testified from the time that he was taken out of the car, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2020"><a name="pos2020"></a>fell on the ground, we were on top of him, it was not a pretty sight, he</p>
<p class="line" id="line2021"><a name="pos2021"></a>was overcome, he was attacked and assaulted to make him lose PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line2022"><a name="pos2022"></a>JUDGE WILSON	141	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line2023"><a name="pos2023"></a>consciousness as quickly as possible.  We came down on him with our knees, we had no mercy, he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2024"><a name="pos2024"></a>subjected as quickly as possible, so that we could get him into the kombi and get away.  It was a public </p>
<p class="line" id="line2025"><a name="pos2025"></a>road, we didn't want to be spotted there, it happened very quickly and it was very serious.  So these things </p>
<p class="line" id="line2026"><a name="pos2026"></a>could all have happened.  It is so, I can't say that it wouldn't have happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2027"><a name="pos2027"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Yes.  Have you seen the document which is supposed to be Annexure A to the post-</p>
<p class="line" id="line2028"><a name="pos2028"></a>mortem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2029"><a name="pos2029"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	I have seen the post-mortem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2030"><a name="pos2030"></a>JUDGE MALL:	No, the Annexure A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2031"><a name="pos2031"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	It doesn't seem that - can you just refer me a little bit closer Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2032"><a name="pos2032"></a>JUDGE MALL:	I am told that the Annexure A to the post</p>
<p class="line" id="line2033"><a name="pos2033"></a>-mortem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2034"><a name="pos2034"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	I haven't got an Annexure A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2035"><a name="pos2035"></a>JUDGE MALL:	If you look at the second page, in answer to question 4, paragraph 4,  it says," body of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2036"><a name="pos2036"></a>Black male", then it says,</p>
<p class="line" id="line2037"><a name="pos2037"></a>		"Big laceration on the right side of the face with fractured mandible.  Right facial bones </p>
<p class="line" id="line2038"><a name="pos2038"></a>on right side of the skull anterially with protruding bones.  Multiple wounds as </p>
<p class="line" id="line2039"><a name="pos2039"></a>numbered on Annexure A".</p>
<p class="line" id="line2040"><a name="pos2040"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	I don't have Annexure A. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2041"><a name="pos2041"></a>JUDGE MALL:  You don't have it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2042"><a name="pos2042"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   I don't know, it seems that you also don't have it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2043"><a name="pos2043"></a>JUDGE MALL:	No, we don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2044"><a name="pos2044"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	If you look at the first page - we've got the typed copy where it says,</p>
<p class="line" id="line2045"><a name="pos2045"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line2046"><a name="pos2046"></a>142	CAPT MENTZ</p>
<p class="line" id="line2047"><a name="pos2047"></a>		"Due to brain injuries and hyper-volemic shock from multiple injuries.   From gunshot </p>
<p class="line" id="line2048"><a name="pos2048"></a>wounds."</p>
<p class="line" id="line2049"><a name="pos2049"></a>So it may well be that the post-mortem indicates that all the injuries are from gunshot wounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2050"><a name="pos2050"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Mr  Chairman, it is possible, obviously the evidence creates certain questions, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2051"><a name="pos2051"></a>that is why I asked Captain Mentz when the victim's wife testified, exactly - if he can remember exactly </p>
<p class="line" id="line2052"><a name="pos2052"></a>where he was shot.  He told me and that is why I have decided to volunteer that evidence.  It is possible that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2053"><a name="pos2053"></a>that evidence might contradict this, it is possible that it might not contradict this unless we have some sort </p>
<p class="line" id="line2054"><a name="pos2054"></a>of expert evidence to explain to us that some of the injuries could not at all have been caused by any </p>
<p class="line" id="line2055"><a name="pos2055"></a>assault.	Or that the injuries could have been caused by gunshot wounds.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2056"><a name="pos2056"></a>	The only point I am trying to make Mr Chairman is that it doesn't appear from the post-mortem in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2057"><a name="pos2057"></a>the light of Captain Mentz's evidence, it doesn't appear from the post-</p>
<p class="line" id="line2058"><a name="pos2058"></a>mortem exactly that there were gunshot wounds anywhere else,</p>
<p class="line" id="line2059"><a name="pos2059"></a>than possibly in the face.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2060"><a name="pos2060"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	Well that depends on the reading, if it says brain injuries and hyper-volemic </p>
<p class="line" id="line2061"><a name="pos2061"></a>shocks, multiple injuries from gunshot wounds, then that falls away completely, so we must get a proper </p>
<p class="line" id="line2062"><a name="pos2062"></a>copy of the post-mortem report and the annexure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2063"><a name="pos2063"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Obviously Mr Chairman.  All I am trying to point out is that it is not clear and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2064"><a name="pos2064"></a>that one cannot come to a specific conclusion regarding this and, the point I am trying to make is that it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2065"><a name="pos2065"></a>possible that the clothes that the witness testified about, could have been the clothes that he had on during </p>
<p class="line" id="line2066"><a name="pos2066"></a>the incident.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2070"><a name="pos2070"></a>photographs on the video that was shown this morning, as far as I can recall, indicated that the clothes had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2071"><a name="pos2071"></a>some damage to it.  As far as that may be important and as far as the Committee may take any note of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2072"><a name="pos2072"></a>	I have not further questions for the witness Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2077"><a name="pos2077"></a>of that document.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2078"><a name="pos2078"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Yes, Mr Chairman, just to inform the Committee, there is a three page post-mortem </p>
<p class="line" id="line2079"><a name="pos2079"></a>report which was given to me by the Investigative Unit, so they did not give me all the annexures, but I will </p>
<p class="line" id="line2080"><a name="pos2080"></a>get in touch with them to check as to where Annexure A is, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2081"><a name="pos2081"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	Did they give you a typed copy of the port-mortem report or was it </p>

<p class="line" id="line2108"><a name="pos2108"></a>	The South African Defence Force could not trace him and at the request of Captain Van Jaarsveld </p>
<p class="line" id="line2109"><a name="pos2109"></a>to trace him, at that stage Captain Jaap van Jaarsveld was our temporary Commanding Officer because if I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2110"><a name="pos2110"></a>remember correctly, Flip Loots was on a special investigation.	Myself and Sergeant van der Westhuizen </p>
<p class="line" id="line2111"><a name="pos2111"></a>went to look for him on the instruction of Captain Hechter.  We traced him within three days.  The way in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2112"><a name="pos2112"></a>which we traced him was out of informant reports, we started monitoring his movements very closely and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2113"><a name="pos2113"></a>within three days we traced him.  That just showed how effective </p>

<p class="line" id="line2116"><a name="pos2116"></a>the Security Police was at that stage.  The questioning took approximately two hours and in that time, his </p>
<p class="line" id="line2117"><a name="pos2117"></a>oxygen supply was limited.  He was assaulted by Slang and Hendrik with handcuffs and electrical shocks </p>
<p class="line" id="line2118"><a name="pos2118"></a>were also executed on him and it was necessary to gain information from him about his activities and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2119"><a name="pos2119"></a>strategies and thereafter he became a source of the police and gave us very important information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2120"><a name="pos2120"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS;	Could I ask you about the methods which were used in his interrogation, were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2121"><a name="pos2121"></a>these the normal methods which were used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2122"><a name="pos2122"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:	 Yes, these were the normal methods which we used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2123"><a name="pos2123"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Did you obtain any relevant information from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2124"><a name="pos2124"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:	  Yes, we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2125"><a name="pos2125"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Do you remember which injuries he sustained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2126"><a name="pos2126"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  At this stage it is difficult for me to remember, I can't remember exactly, but we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2127"><a name="pos2127"></a>assaulted him quite seriously.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2130"><a name="pos2130"></a>MR CURRIN:	Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2131"><a name="pos2131"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR CURRIN:	WO van Vuuren, you've said that he threw petrol bombs and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2132"><a name="pos2132"></a>was involved in many activities, did you see him throwing petrol bombs, on what basis are you making </p>
<p class="line" id="line2133"><a name="pos2133"></a>those allegations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2134"><a name="pos2134"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:	 I never saw him personally, but out of the informant reports which we received </p>
<p class="line" id="line2135"><a name="pos2135"></a>it was quite clear that he was involved and he was a leader in  Mamelodi who was involved in petrol bomb </p>

<p class="line" id="line2139"><a name="pos2139"></a>MR CURRIN:	Was he ever charged with any offence ever sentenced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2140"><a name="pos2140"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:	  I cannot remember, I cannot say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2141"><a name="pos2141"></a>MR CURRIN:	So it is all hearsay?  It is hearsay, what you've repeated here with regard to his activities, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2142"><a name="pos2142"></a>is hearsay, you don't know it as a matter of fact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2143"><a name="pos2143"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:	 No, I know it for a fact out of the various informant reports, we did not only </p>
<p class="line" id="line2144"><a name="pos2144"></a>have one informant who was supplying us with information, there were several informants who were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2145"><a name="pos2145"></a>bringing us information on Scheepers Morudi and his name came up quite often, so it was not just hearsay </p>
<p class="line" id="line2146"><a name="pos2146"></a>evidence, it was fact because the informants did not know about each other and did not work together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2147"><a name="pos2147"></a>MR CURRIN:   I will not argue with you as to what constitutes hearsay, I will leave it there.  Could you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2148"><a name="pos2148"></a>give a little bit more information with regard to the torture?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2149"><a name="pos2149"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN: It is a long time ago, but if I remember correctly we used a gas mask, we put it over </p>
<p class="line" id="line2150"><a name="pos2150"></a>his head and we left the plug in and we denied him oxygen.  His hands and feet were tied and we assaulted </p>
<p class="line" id="line2151"><a name="pos2151"></a>him several times.  We assaulted him with our bare hands and some of the Constables involved, we kicked </p>
<p class="line" id="line2152"><a name="pos2152"></a>him too.  Some of the Constables involved assaulted him with the handcuffs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2153"><a name="pos2153"></a>MR CURRIN:   Would you say that he was severely assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2154"><a name="pos2154"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2155"><a name="pos2155"></a>MR CURRIN: He has asked me to put to you that he was never a member of the ANC, he was a student </p>
<p class="line" id="line2156"><a name="pos2156"></a>activist, he was not an ANC activist.  Do you have proof that he was a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2157"><a name="pos2157"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  No, I have no proof that he was a member of PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>

<p class="line" id="line2159"><a name="pos2159"></a>the ANC because all those documents have been destroyed as </p>
<p class="line" id="line2160"><a name="pos2160"></a>it has been said time and again in the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2161"><a name="pos2161"></a>MR CURRIN:	You assumed, I would imagine that if one was an activist, whether it was a student </p>
<p class="line" id="line2162"><a name="pos2162"></a>activist that one was an ANC activist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2163"><a name="pos2163"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  That is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2164"><a name="pos2164"></a>MR CURRIN:   Have you spoken to him at all since he has been here the last couple of days, have you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2165"><a name="pos2165"></a>spoken to him at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2166"><a name="pos2166"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   No, I haven't spoken to him at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2167"><a name="pos2167"></a>MR CURRIN:	Have you possibly approached him about your application and the way you feel and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2168"><a name="pos2168"></a>your remorse and asked him for forgiveness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2169"><a name="pos2169"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  No, I did not do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2170"><a name="pos2170"></a>MR CURRIN:   Were you involved in the bombing of his house before that, a couple of months before he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2171"><a name="pos2171"></a>was assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2172"><a name="pos2172"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   It is possible, I was involved in several bomb attacks on several houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2173"><a name="pos2173"></a>MR CURRIN:   Have you applied for amnesty in respect of all these bomb attacks on all the houses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2174"><a name="pos2174"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   Yes, I have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2175"><a name="pos2175"></a>MR CURRIN:   And you can't recall the details?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2176"><a name="pos2176"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  No, there were too many, I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2177"><a name="pos2177"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   I really don't have a problem that the witness testifies, but I would ask Mr Currin to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2178"><a name="pos2178"></a>keep to this specific amnesty application in respect of this specific incident.	As you are aware, WO </p>
<p class="line" id="line2179"><a name="pos2179"></a>van Vuuren has made various applications pertaining to various incidents, as well as one global application </p>
<p class="line" id="line2180"><a name="pos2180"></a>pertaining to certain incidents which he cannot remember a lot about.  I object against further interrogation </p>
<p class="line" id="line2181"><a name="pos2181"></a>about other amnesty applications.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2182"><a name="pos2182"></a>MR CURRIN:	Mr Chairman, it just relates to the question PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>

<p class="line" id="line2186"><a name="pos2186"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Well, as you know he has applied, made application for amnesty for various offences.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2187"><a name="pos2187"></a>Among them is the bombing of houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2188"><a name="pos2188"></a>MR CURRIN:	Would you just bear with me for a moment?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2190"><a name="pos2190"></a>MR CURRIN:  You personally participated in the physical assault?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2192"><a name="pos2192"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR CURRIN.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2193"><a name="pos2193"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Mr Mpshe, are there any questions you wish to put to this witness?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2195"><a name="pos2195"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV MPSHE:	Can you explain as per your application page 156, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2196"><a name="pos2196"></a>the last paragraph - "the telephone method was used on him", exactly what does that entail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2197"><a name="pos2197"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   Mr Chairman, it is an old fashioned telephone where you had the crank that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2198"><a name="pos2198"></a>turned, there were two wires coming from the telephone, you took that and you connected it to the person </p>
<p class="line" id="line2199"><a name="pos2199"></a>to his feet or hand or whatever, it all depended on what you felt like on the particular day towards the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2200"><a name="pos2200"></a>activists, and then you turned the crank and you put electrical shocks through him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2201"><a name="pos2201"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Now in this incident, to which part of his body did you tie the wires?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2202"><a name="pos2202"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   I cannot remember, I really cannot remember but we did use the instrument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2203"><a name="pos2203"></a>ADV MPSHE:	Why can't you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2204"><a name="pos2204"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   It is 10 years ago.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2208"><a name="pos2208"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   But that was not the only time that I was present, there were many other times in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2209"><a name="pos2209"></a>the same manner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2210"><a name="pos2210"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	This was in fact one of the most common of the machinery used by the police </p>
<p class="line" id="line2211"><a name="pos2211"></a>for this shock treatment wasn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2212"><a name="pos2212"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   That is correct, Your Honour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2213"><a name="pos2213"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Can you recall how long was this execution done on him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2214"><a name="pos2214"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   Normally about ten seconds, five to ten seconds per shock, per shock treatment.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2216"><a name="pos2216"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:    What exactly did you want from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2217"><a name="pos2217"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  We questioned him to obtain information from him regarding the fellow persons </p>
<p class="line" id="line2218"><a name="pos2218"></a>who worked with them, to control whether the information that we had, which we thought was correct, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2219"><a name="pos2219"></a>wanted to verify those and to get general information regarding the unrest situation in Mamelodi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2220"><a name="pos2220"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:    What was the ultimate objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2221"><a name="pos2221"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   The purpose was to find people who were working with them, to arrest them or to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2222"><a name="pos2222"></a>eliminate them and to find out exactly where they were hiding from the Security</p>
<p class="line" id="line2223"><a name="pos2223"></a>Police and the Defence Force at that stage, where firearms or weapons might have been concealed or </p>
<p class="line" id="line2224"><a name="pos2224"></a>hidden away, in the general state of emergency which was prevalent exactly where they were hiding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2225"><a name="pos2225"></a>	Where we could get hold of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2226"><a name="pos2226"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	The aspect of weapons seems to be something that you did not allude to earlier </p>
<p class="line" id="line2227"><a name="pos2227"></a>on.  You mentioned that he was involved in "brandstigting", intimidation, "petrolbom PRETORIA </p>

<p class="line" id="line2231"><a name="pos2231"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  I can only mention that Scheepers at that stage, I could say was the leader in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2232"><a name="pos2232"></a>Mamelodi.  The Defence Force looked for him for months, and they couldn't trace him and Captain van </p>
<p class="line" id="line2233"><a name="pos2233"></a>Jaarsveld requested us and there were many activities for which they were looking for him, but as I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2234"><a name="pos2234"></a>stated to you my information was that it was only concerning schools' boycotts, arson, petrol bomb attacks, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2235"><a name="pos2235"></a>but while we interrogated him, we asked him whether he knew about any weapons which had been hidden </p>
<p class="line" id="line2236"><a name="pos2236"></a>which he knew about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2237"><a name="pos2237"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	To the extent that you wanted information for the purpose of effecting some </p>
<p class="line" id="line2238"><a name="pos2238"></a>arrest, the impression I get is that this was a criminal investigation after all.  It was nothing else but a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2239"><a name="pos2239"></a>criminal investigation which was going on here, criminal investigations by yourselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2240"><a name="pos2240"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   I don't clearly understand the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2241"><a name="pos2241"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	I asked you to tell us what the ultimate objective of your exercises were, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2242"><a name="pos2242"></a>you mentioned also that you wanted information from him so that you could effect some arrests and I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line2243"><a name="pos2243"></a>saying to you therefore it would seem that you were busy with nothing else but a criminal investigation </p>
<p class="line" id="line2244"><a name="pos2244"></a>here for purposes of arrest and prosecution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2245"><a name="pos2245"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   At that stage it was so, we wished to arrest people and prosecute people who </p>
<p class="line" id="line2246"><a name="pos2246"></a>worked with Scheepers, that is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2247"><a name="pos2247"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	And I am saying to you the torture, the interrogation and the torture that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2248"><a name="pos2248"></a>accompanied it, was not any different to the torture and interrogation you would have done on somebody </p>
<p class="line" id="line2249"><a name="pos2249"></a>who had committed a robbery? It was </p>

<p class="line" id="line2253"><a name="pos2253"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   No, Mr Chairman, Scheepers was involved in petrol bomb attacks on policemen's </p>
<p class="line" id="line2254"><a name="pos2254"></a>houses, he was an activist in the townships, it was not just criminal affairs, criminal matters if I understand </p>

<p class="line" id="line2256"><a name="pos2256"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	And you say that he made mention of firearms only during the interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2257"><a name="pos2257"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  I can't remember whether he referred to firearms.  We asked him whether he knew </p>
<p class="line" id="line2258"><a name="pos2258"></a>about any firearms that had been hidden in Mamelodi, ANC, we referred to DLB's, we asked him, he didn't </p>

<p class="line" id="line2260"><a name="pos2260"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	Well you don't remember whether you got any answer from him in that regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2261"><a name="pos2261"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   I cannot remember, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2262"><a name="pos2262"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	For all you know he might have said he didn't know anything about those </p>
<p class="line" id="line2263"><a name="pos2263"></a>things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2264"><a name="pos2264"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   That is quite possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2265"><a name="pos2265"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	Did you get any information out of him that eventually led to the arrest of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2266"><a name="pos2266"></a>anybody? </p>
<p class="line" id="line2267"><a name="pos2267"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:    Mr Chairman I cannot remember today.  This all happened 10 years ago, I really </p>
<p class="line" id="line2268"><a name="pos2268"></a>cannot remember, it is possible, but I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2269"><a name="pos2269"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	You mentioned that some people were looking for him, I don't know whether </p>

<p class="line" id="line2271"><a name="pos2271"></a>police, I don't know, but your help was eventually called in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2272"><a name="pos2272"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   That is correct, it was the Defence Force, the Defence Force was stationed in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2273"><a name="pos2273"></a>Mamelodi, they had an office there.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2281"><a name="pos2281"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   That is correct, we would have passed it on, but we would have kept most of it for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2282"><a name="pos2282"></a>ourselves and used that.  We also didn't hand him over to the Defence Force, he became an informant of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2283"><a name="pos2283"></a>Security Police after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2284"><a name="pos2284"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	But that was after the assault, possibly as a result of the assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2285"><a name="pos2285"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  That is correct.  That is correct, that is possible, that it was as a consequence </p>
<p class="line" id="line2286"><a name="pos2286"></a>thereof Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2287"><a name="pos2287"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	I think what my learned colleague wishes to determine is what the political motive was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2288"><a name="pos2288"></a>when you questioned the man, was it not just a matter of trying to trace a criminal offences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2289"><a name="pos2289"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN;   That is correct, it was to trace criminal deeds and to trace the people who were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2290"><a name="pos2290"></a>working with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2291"><a name="pos2291"></a>ADV DE JAGER: 	 But what has this got to do with politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2292"><a name="pos2292"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:    Mr Chairman, he was at that stage an ANC activist, in other words he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2293"><a name="pos2293"></a>involved with the ANC activists who were causing great trouble in Mamelodi and that was why we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2294"><a name="pos2294"></a>questioned him.  He was an ANC activist and</p>
<p class="line" id="line2295"><a name="pos2295"></a>after all that had to do with politics in my books.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2296"><a name="pos2296"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	I think you have to draw a distinction, there can be nationalists or any other party whose </p>
<p class="line" id="line2297"><a name="pos2297"></a>members may commit housebreaking and burglary and have nothing to do with politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2298"><a name="pos2298"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:    That is correct, Your Honour, but if ANC </p>

<p class="line" id="line2301"><a name="pos2301"></a>activists attack policemen's houses with petrol bombs and arrange boycotts, it is a political motive in my </p>
<p class="line" id="line2302"><a name="pos2302"></a>books.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2303"><a name="pos2303"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	The question is simply whether in this particular instance the purpose of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2304"><a name="pos2304"></a>investigation was of a criminal nature or what exactly it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2305"><a name="pos2305"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   It was a criminal investigation, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2306"><a name="pos2306"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	And you have no idea if you got information from him that resulted in any </p>
<p class="line" id="line2307"><a name="pos2307"></a>arrests, prosecutions or matters of that nature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2308"><a name="pos2308"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   Mr Chairman, I cannot remember today, it is too long ago.  It is possible that it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2309"><a name="pos2309"></a>was so, I cannot remember, there were many instances of this nature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2310"><a name="pos2310"></a>JUDGE WILSON;	 Can you remember that about 10 minutes ago when Mr Currin was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2311"><a name="pos2311"></a>questioning you, you said it might be possible that he wasn't a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2312"><a name="pos2312"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:    I doubt that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2313"><a name="pos2313"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	  My recollection is that Mr Currin specifically put to you that he wasn't and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2314"><a name="pos2314"></a>you said you couldn't challenge that, you had no proof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2315"><a name="pos2315"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   I cannot prove it because I don't have proof, all the proof that existed was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2316"><a name="pos2316"></a>destroyed after my time in terms of a national command from Security Headquarters, all documentation </p>
<p class="line" id="line2317"><a name="pos2317"></a>was burnt, I don't have anything to prove what I am saying today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2318"><a name="pos2318"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	Sir was it not true from the evidence which</p>
<p class="line" id="line2319"><a name="pos2319"></a>has been given by Mr Cronje, that the general practice of the Security Police was to eliminate people who </p>
<p class="line" id="line2320"><a name="pos2320"></a>would have committed acts such as these committed by Mr Scheepers Morudi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2321"><a name="pos2321"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:    That is correct that people like him had PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line2322"><a name="pos2322"></a>MS KHAMPEPE	151	W/O VAN VUUREN</p>
<p class="line" id="line2323"><a name="pos2323"></a>to be eliminated, or were eliminated in certain instances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2324"><a name="pos2324"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	Can you just explain what would be the criteria which would be used to determine </p>
<p class="line" id="line2325"><a name="pos2325"></a>whether a person was capable of immediate elimination or would be rehabilitated as in the instance of Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2326"><a name="pos2326"></a>Morudi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2327"><a name="pos2327"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   It is very difficult today to sit and explain here which people were eliminated and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2328"><a name="pos2328"></a>which people were not eliminated.  We played it by ear, depending on how things went at that stage, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2329"><a name="pos2329"></a>whether the person seemed prepared to work with the Security Police at that stage or whether he was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2330"><a name="pos2330"></a>prepared to cooperate with us.  I think to a large extent if Scheepers had not agreed to become an informer, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2331"><a name="pos2331"></a>we would quite possibly have eliminated him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2332"><a name="pos2332"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	So after this incident Mr Morudi became an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2333"><a name="pos2333"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2334"><a name="pos2334"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2335"><a name="pos2335"></a>RE-EXAMINATION BY ADV DU PLESSIS:	Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr van Vuuren, in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2336"><a name="pos2336"></a>Security Branch where you were working at that stage, what did you activities involve?  Did your activities </p>
<p class="line" id="line2337"><a name="pos2337"></a>involve actions against the liberation movements, deeds of activists, or did your activities involve normal </p>
<p class="line" id="line2338"><a name="pos2338"></a>police docket investigation of burglaries etc?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2339"><a name="pos2339"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  No, it involved actions against activists, no normal investigations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2340"><a name="pos2340"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   So in other words your activity as a member of the Security Branch at that stage </p>
<p class="line" id="line2341"><a name="pos2341"></a>Warrant Officer, was primarily aimed at what - normal thieves, robbers or were your activities aimed at </p>
<p class="line" id="line2342"><a name="pos2342"></a>people who were involved in destabilising the Country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2343"><a name="pos2343"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   It was people who were politically PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line2344"><a name="pos2344"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	152	W/O VAN VUUREN</p>
<p class="line" id="line2345"><a name="pos2345"></a>involved in destabilising the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2346"><a name="pos2346"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Okay, now WO van Vuuren, people like these activists or terrorists, as we have often </p>
<p class="line" id="line2347"><a name="pos2347"></a>testified before the Committee, were these people also involved in criminal activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2348"><a name="pos2348"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   That is correct, they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2349"><a name="pos2349"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:    Did such people also make themselves guilty of normal common law or criminal </p>
<p class="line" id="line2350"><a name="pos2350"></a>transgressions in an effort to destabilise the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2351"><a name="pos2351"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:    Yes, they did make themselves - they were guilty of crimes to destabilise the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2352"><a name="pos2352"></a>country and to create chaos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2353"><a name="pos2353"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Okay, as you can remember, was Mr Morudi a person who was involved in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2354"><a name="pos2354"></a>political destabilisation attempt or was he an ordinary criminal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2355"><a name="pos2355"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   He was a person who was involved in the destabilisation efforts of the country and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2356"><a name="pos2356"></a>the campaign for destabilisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2357"><a name="pos2357"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	And the methods used by activists to destabilise the country at that stage, which </p>
<p class="line" id="line2358"><a name="pos2358"></a>methods did they use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2359"><a name="pos2359"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   It was arson, petrol bomb attacks, intimidation and in certain cases murder, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2360"><a name="pos2360"></a>boycotts, consumer boycotts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2361"><a name="pos2361"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   And is that the sort of action in which Mr Morudi was involved in and made himself </p>
<p class="line" id="line2362"><a name="pos2362"></a>guilty of as you can remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2363"><a name="pos2363"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   Yes, it is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2364"><a name="pos2364"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:    And when you interrogated him, did you obtain information from him or attempt to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2365"><a name="pos2365"></a>obtain information in order to accuse him and to have him found guilty in a PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>

<p class="line" id="line2367"><a name="pos2367"></a>criminal court of criminal transgressions or was the purpose to get other information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2368"><a name="pos2368"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   The purpose was to obtain information from him in order to accuse him - no, to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2369"><a name="pos2369"></a>accuse him wouldn't have helped at that stage because we wouldn't have had a witness to testify against </p>
<p class="line" id="line2370"><a name="pos2370"></a>him because the witness would be dead the next day were he to testify, so the idea was not to interrogate </p>
<p class="line" id="line2371"><a name="pos2371"></a>him, to take him to court, the idea was to interrogate him to obtain more information regarding the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2372"><a name="pos2372"></a>activities of the activists in Mamelodi.  Criminal activities as well as other activities, meetings which they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2373"><a name="pos2373"></a>were holding, when they were having meetings, who would address them, whether they had any contact </p>
<p class="line" id="line2374"><a name="pos2374"></a>with ANC infiltrators, etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2375"><a name="pos2375"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Okay, Warrant Officer van Vuuren, in your application you give in great detail </p>
<p class="line" id="line2376"><a name="pos2376"></a>the purpose of the interrogations, that which was set out in the application has been stated on numerous </p>
<p class="line" id="line2377"><a name="pos2377"></a>occasions with the same motivation as in all other interrogations for which amnesty applications are made </p>
<p class="line" id="line2378"><a name="pos2378"></a>with regard to all the applicants before the Committee and for that reason I am not offering this testimony </p>
<p class="line" id="line2379"><a name="pos2379"></a>verbally, verbatim before the Committee on every occasion, but on this regard questions had been asked </p>
<p class="line" id="line2380"><a name="pos2380"></a>regarding things which are stated very clearly in your statement.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2381"><a name="pos2381"></a>	Will you turn to page 158 please of your application and there the general motivation which we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2382"><a name="pos2382"></a>have in all the</p>
<p class="line" id="line2383"><a name="pos2383"></a>applicants' applications with regard to your actions, will you please read that to the Committee.  From the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2384"><a name="pos2384"></a>purpose of the investigation.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2385"><a name="pos2385"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	 Mr du Plessis, I don't think this what is PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line2386"><a name="pos2386"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	153	W/O VAN VUUREN</p>
<p class="line" id="line2387"><a name="pos2387"></a>being disputed, the specific question was whether it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2388"><a name="pos2388"></a>political or criminal and I think that is the difference between a general motivation and the motivation </p>
<p class="line" id="line2389"><a name="pos2389"></a>which had already been given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2390"><a name="pos2390"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Yes, but Mr Chairman, with respect, in the motivation in the application, it comes </p>
<p class="line" id="line2391"><a name="pos2391"></a>out very clearly that the whole purpose of the interrogation and the investigation was absolutely of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2392"><a name="pos2392"></a>political nature and that is also clearly apparent further on, where the specific motive is set out on page 161 </p>
<p class="line" id="line2393"><a name="pos2393"></a>to 162.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2394"><a name="pos2394"></a>	I don't attempt to prefer the evidence every time with regard to every case, but if I could just with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2395"><a name="pos2395"></a>regard to the questions which had been asked, if I could just be afforded the opportunity to read into the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2396"><a name="pos2396"></a>record, the testimony and I also wish to make the point and I will argue to it at the end, that I was under the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2397"><a name="pos2397"></a>impression that he did not quite clearly understand the full scope of the questions and therefore I think it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2398"><a name="pos2398"></a>very important to get this stated in the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2399"><a name="pos2399"></a>	Will you just continue please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2400"><a name="pos2400"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  "The purpose of interrogations were dual,</p>
<p class="line" id="line2401"><a name="pos2401"></a>		Intimidation and obtaining information: Intimidation -  When activists were interrogated </p>
<p class="line" id="line2402"><a name="pos2402"></a>they were intimidated to stop their activities and also to inform other activists that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2403"><a name="pos2403"></a>would be interrogated and fought with tooth and nail, they had to understand that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2404"><a name="pos2404"></a>were serious in our actions against them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2405"><a name="pos2405"></a>		During interrogation and after certain information had been obtained, attempts were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2406"><a name="pos2406"></a>made to turn activists and informants to become informants for </p>

<p class="line" id="line2409"><a name="pos2409"></a>		the Security Police.  These activists and/or terrorists who were turned, were the most </p>
<p class="line" id="line2410"><a name="pos2410"></a>effective means to combat the liberation movements, because they were trustees of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2411"><a name="pos2411"></a>other terrorists and activists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2412"><a name="pos2412"></a>		The most striking example was Joe Mamasela as is apparent from this application.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2413"><a name="pos2413"></a>Ascaris who were former terrorists, were very effective in the suppression of political </p>
<p class="line" id="line2414"><a name="pos2414"></a>activities".</p>
<p class="line" id="line2415"><a name="pos2415"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Were you successful in this attempt, if we can just pause a moment with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2416"><a name="pos2416"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   Yes, that is correct.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2417"><a name="pos2417"></a>		"For the purpose of insurgents and counter-insurgents' activities, it was important to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2418"><a name="pos2418"></a>obtain information in this regard, it was of cardinal importance to get channels exposed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2419"><a name="pos2419"></a>etc, and without interrogation techniques a network of information would never have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2420"><a name="pos2420"></a>been determined to combat the total onslaught.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2421"><a name="pos2421"></a>		Interrogation which was effective with regard to obtaining information was essential.  It </p>
<p class="line" id="line2422"><a name="pos2422"></a>was essential to trace deeds of terror and to plan counter strategies and take measures on </p>

<p class="line" id="line2441"><a name="pos2441"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   We as Security Police did not work with criminals, we worked with activists, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line2442"><a name="pos2442"></a>many of the activists also made themselves guilty of criminal deeds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2443"><a name="pos2443"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Okay, one last aspect which I forgot to ask you about.  Exactly where did your </p>

<p class="line" id="line2445"><a name="pos2445"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  It came from Captain van Jaarsveld and from Captain Hechter.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2447"><a name="pos2447"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:    I could just mention that Captain van Jaarsveld did not tell me to assault </p>

<p class="line" id="line2458"><a name="pos2458"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:    It was normally a high profile activist or terrorist who was concerned with the </p>

<p class="line" id="line2498"><a name="pos2498"></a>MR CURRIN:	I put it to the witness that my  - I challenged that my client was not an ANC activist and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2499"><a name="pos2499"></a>put it to the witness that my client was a student activist, that I put to him.  That is what he will testify, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2500"><a name="pos2500"></a>he was a student activist, but he was never a member of the ANC.  I put that to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2501"><a name="pos2501"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	What does that mean "student activist"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2502"><a name="pos2502"></a>MR CURRIN:	Well he was as a student at school, he was involved in student activist politics.  I think </p>
<p class="line" id="line2503"><a name="pos2503"></a>that we know what sort of politics the students were involved in.  He was never a member of the African </p>

<p class="line" id="line2505"><a name="pos2505"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	  Yes, but I just want to have this clarified because at some stage I personally </p>
<p class="line" id="line2506"><a name="pos2506"></a>put questions to the witness which would have tended to tax him severely on whether or not the victim </p>
<p class="line" id="line2507"><a name="pos2507"></a>could have been a legitimate political target, a legitimate political target and if there is no severe </p>
<p class="line" id="line2508"><a name="pos2508"></a>disagreement on the question as to whether or not he was in fact in politics at whatever level, that may </p>
<p class="line" id="line2509"><a name="pos2509"></a>actually, I mean I am speaking for myself, that may clarify or make certain issues a little bit easier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2510"><a name="pos2510"></a>MR CURRIN:	Certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2511"><a name="pos2511"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	So I understand you to concede that the victim was engaged in politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2512"><a name="pos2512"></a>MR CURRIN:	Absolutely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2513"><a name="pos2513"></a>FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR CURRIN:    Mr Chairman while I have the microphone I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2514"><a name="pos2514"></a>do have one question that I would like to clarify in re-examination which arose during some of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2515"><a name="pos2515"></a>subsequent questioning if I may put something to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2516"><a name="pos2516"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Yes, you may ask your question, sure.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2519"><a name="pos2519"></a>MR CURRIN:   It is one question.  My learned friend put it to you that we have heard a lot about </p>
<p class="line" id="line2520"><a name="pos2520"></a>eliminations and assassinations and when an activist qualifies to be eliminated and you said something a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2521"><a name="pos2521"></a>moment ago which, in my recollection, has been said for the first time and I just want to hear whether what </p>
<p class="line" id="line2522"><a name="pos2522"></a>I heard, is correct and you mean what you said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2523"><a name="pos2523"></a>	You said that high profile activists were targets for elimination.  Now that we've heard often </p>
<p class="line" id="line2524"><a name="pos2524"></a>before, but you've added something to that.  I think you added that high profile activists who were involved </p>
<p class="line" id="line2525"><a name="pos2525"></a>in killing or in murders qualified for elimination, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2526"><a name="pos2526"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   That was usually the case.  That is correct, that was usually the case but if a person </p>
<p class="line" id="line2527"><a name="pos2527"></a>threw a petrol bomb at another's house, then it was an attempt at their lives, he wasn't playing with them, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2528"><a name="pos2528"></a>then that would also have qualified the person to have been eliminated, yes ....(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2529"><a name="pos2529"></a>MR CURRIN:	Even if no one died as a result of the petrol bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2530"><a name="pos2530"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:    Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2531"><a name="pos2531"></a>MR CURRIN:  So it is not correct to add the rider "if that person was involved in a murder"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2532"><a name="pos2532"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:    That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2533"><a name="pos2533"></a>MR CURRIN:	Thank you Sir.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2543"><a name="pos2543"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2544"><a name="pos2544"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Do you accept the evidence with regards to the facts of this incident as said by </p>
<p class="line" id="line2545"><a name="pos2545"></a>Warrant Officer van Vuuren?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2546"><a name="pos2546"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2547"><a name="pos2547"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Now Captain Hechter, the political motivation has been set out in your application </p>
<p class="line" id="line2548"><a name="pos2548"></a>from page 130 to page 134.  Do you confirm it as being correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2549"><a name="pos2549"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	  Yes, that is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2550"><a name="pos2550"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Captain Hechter, with regards to one or two aspects about which Warrant Officer </p>
<p class="line" id="line2551"><a name="pos2551"></a>van Vuuren was questioned.  Could you perhaps just give the Committee an indication of the type of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2552"><a name="pos2552"></a>persons who were involved in petrol bomb attacks and so forth, were they normal criminals or were these </p>
<p class="line" id="line2553"><a name="pos2553"></a>people politically active?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2554"><a name="pos2554"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	Chairperson, the youth activists as Mr Currin called them, were furthering all </p>
<p class="line" id="line2555"><a name="pos2555"></a>the aims and objectives of the ANC at the time.  In Tshaba it was often announced, even on Radio </p>
<p class="line" id="line2556"><a name="pos2556"></a>Freedom, that the youth - the so-called informants had to be attacked, they had to attack the police, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2557"><a name="pos2557"></a>had to be involved in the struggle which included the burning of buses, the boycotting of buses, consumer </p>
<p class="line" id="line2558"><a name="pos2558"></a>boycotts.  So that when we were out looking for activists it was purely a political activist.  We were not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2559"><a name="pos2559"></a>involved in normal criminal activities and that is why the police detectives who were at the stations in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2560"><a name="pos2560"></a>areas, they were deployed to do that type of work, we did not do those cases, we did political matters and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2561"><a name="pos2561"></a>we investigated political cases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2562"><a name="pos2562"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line2563"><a name="pos2563"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	159	CAPT HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line2564"><a name="pos2564"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Captain Hechter, what was your general experience with such activists, were some </p>
<p class="line" id="line2565"><a name="pos2565"></a>of them members of the ANC were others not members of the ANC, could you comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2566"><a name="pos2566"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	It is very difficult when you start monitoring an activist to know if it is a card </p>
<p class="line" id="line2567"><a name="pos2567"></a>carrying member of the ANC, what they did do was through the person's actions by furthering the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2568"><a name="pos2568"></a>objectives of the ANC at the time, by the methods that they applied, you were able to identify an activist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2569"><a name="pos2569"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Just to include there, this attack was in 1986 and 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2570"><a name="pos2570"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	 That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2571"><a name="pos2571"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Was it permissible at the time to be a card carrying member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2572"><a name="pos2572"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	That is correct, so they would not have had their cards with them either, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2573"><a name="pos2573"></a>would have been members of the ANC but would not have carried any cards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2574"><a name="pos2574"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Captain Hechter, the type of interrogations you were involved in at the time, what </p>
<p class="line" id="line2575"><a name="pos2575"></a>was the aim of the interrogation with regards to obtaining information, could you just elaborate to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2576"><a name="pos2576"></a>Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2577"><a name="pos2577"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	Firstly it was to obtain information, further information which could assist us in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2578"><a name="pos2578"></a>combatting further acts of terrorism, greater acts of terrorism, lesser acts of terrorism, such as consumer - </p>
<p class="line" id="line2579"><a name="pos2579"></a>the launching of consumer boycotts to identify the involved instigators and prevent them proceeding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2580"><a name="pos2580"></a>	The interrogations were fairly violent.  In order to intimidate the youths to such an extent that - it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2581"><a name="pos2581"></a>was an attempt to prevent them from participating in this type of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2582"><a name="pos2582"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line2583"><a name="pos2583"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	160	CAPT HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line2584"><a name="pos2584"></a>action any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2585"><a name="pos2585"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   After having heard what Warrant Officer van Vuuren testified here, would you say </p>
<p class="line" id="line2586"><a name="pos2586"></a>that the objective at the time would have been to obtain information, charge the person and have them </p>
<p class="line" id="line2587"><a name="pos2587"></a>convicted in a court of law or was the objective to obtain information with regards to the liberation </p>
<p class="line" id="line2588"><a name="pos2588"></a>movement's struggle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2589"><a name="pos2589"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	It is very difficult for me to answer that question at this point.  What I heard </p>
<p class="line" id="line2590"><a name="pos2590"></a>from Warrant Officer van Vuuren was that thereafter he was made a member of the</p>
<p class="line" id="line2591"><a name="pos2591"></a>Branch, so he would have given us his cooperation, which is why we would have decided to use him as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2592"><a name="pos2592"></a>source, but I doubt whether we would have wanted to arrest him and have him charged and so forth, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2593"><a name="pos2593"></a>because at the time we did not try to arrest activists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2594"><a name="pos2594"></a>	The information which we confronted them with could not be aligned to any witnesses due to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2595"><a name="pos2595"></a>intimidation factor which existed at the time.  I would not say that it did not happen at all, there might have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2596"><a name="pos2596"></a>been cases where persons were arrested and detained in terms of the law, but it was very minimal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2597"><a name="pos2597"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Captain Hechter could you please page to page 339 of your application.  Captain </p>
<p class="line" id="line2598"><a name="pos2598"></a>Hechter, can you page to the next page entitled "Reconciliation", that is part of your application.  Could </p>

<p class="line" id="line2622"><a name="pos2622"></a>prosecute, arrest and prosecute and one did not normally detain, that was an absolute exception?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2628"><a name="pos2628"></a>people working with us, still did arrest some of these people and kept them under the Security regulations, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2629"><a name="pos2629"></a>but me, as a person, in our department or in our section, we felt in certain circumstances, we could by </p>
<p class="line" id="line2630"><a name="pos2630"></a>intimidation, we could get a better reaction out of the people, because when those people were left out of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2631"><a name="pos2631"></a>jail after a while, they came back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2632"><a name="pos2632"></a>They were the real "rammetjies" around there, so we battled with them.  My department, the Black Power </p>
<p class="line" id="line2633"><a name="pos2633"></a>Department.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2634"><a name="pos2634"></a>MR CURRIN:   What you are saying relates generally to what you refer to as the Black activists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2635"><a name="pos2635"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	The Black activists, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2636"><a name="pos2636"></a>MR CURRIN:   So there wasn't a tendency to detain, as far as you were concerned and in your division, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2637"><a name="pos2637"></a>activists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2638"><a name="pos2638"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	There were many, if we just could have kept records, you would have seen that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2639"><a name="pos2639"></a>many of them were detained, but in certain instances the decision was taken by me as the Officer that a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2640"><a name="pos2640"></a>certain person should not be</p>
<p class="line" id="line2641"><a name="pos2641"></a>arrested, but be picked up, interrogated, intimidated and then released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2642"><a name="pos2642"></a>MR CURRIN:   But the reality Captain Hechter is that the vast, vast, vast majority of people were in fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line2643"><a name="pos2643"></a>detained, of the activists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2644"><a name="pos2644"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	You say so I do not know, that may be so, I cannot argue with you. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2645"><a name="pos2645"></a>MR CURRIN:	I put to you that also, we will lead evidence on behalf of the victims that the tendency </p>
<p class="line" id="line2646"><a name="pos2646"></a>was in fact to detain and not to eliminate which is  ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2647"><a name="pos2647"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	We are not talking about elimination, we are talking about intimidation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2648"><a name="pos2648"></a>MR CURRIN:	You heard also what the previous witness said with regard to elimination, as to when a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2649"><a name="pos2649"></a>person would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2650"><a name="pos2650"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line2651"><a name="pos2651"></a>MR CURRIN	162	CAPT HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line2652"><a name="pos2652"></a>qualify for elimination, do you agree with his answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2653"><a name="pos2653"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	Could you please tell me ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2654"><a name="pos2654"></a>MR CURRIN:   He said a prominent activist who was involved in an act which would result in the death of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2655"><a name="pos2655"></a>a person and he changed that to say for example, if there was a petrol bombing and a prominent activist </p>
<p class="line" id="line2656"><a name="pos2656"></a>was involved, then that person would then qualify for elimination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2657"><a name="pos2657"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	The English have a saying that "there is no rule if there is no exception", those </p>
<p class="line" id="line2658"><a name="pos2658"></a>decisions were taken by us on the basis of information obtained from sources and the decision was taken by </p>
<p class="line" id="line2659"><a name="pos2659"></a>me quite often and in many instances by Head Office, when one should be eliminated and when not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2660"><a name="pos2660"></a>	There was no set rule that if this was the third house that person would be eliminated, it went </p>
<p class="line" id="line2661"><a name="pos2661"></a>according to the circumstances at the time, the amount of violent acts which the person had committed and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2662"><a name="pos2662"></a>how you, as a leadership figure, had blossomed in the community.  If you remember correctly we tried to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2663"><a name="pos2663"></a>eliminate Father Mkatshwa which was a good example. 	Look at the leadership figure that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2664"><a name="pos2664"></a>turned out to be.  He was a prominent leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2665"><a name="pos2665"></a>MR CURRIN:	If I understand you correctly there were no fixed criteria, it was an ad hoc decision taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line2666"><a name="pos2666"></a>depending on the circumstances at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2667"><a name="pos2667"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	That is correct, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2668"><a name="pos2668"></a>MR CURRIN:   That is very different from what the previous witness said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2669"><a name="pos2669"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	He was a Sergeant at the time and he worked under my command, so it could </p>
<p class="line" id="line2670"><a name="pos2670"></a>have been his perception.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2671"><a name="pos2671"></a>MR CURRIN:	I have no further questions to this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2672"><a name="pos2672"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR CURRIN.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2673"><a name="pos2673"></a>JUDGE MALL:	Mr Mpshe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2674"><a name="pos2674"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line2675"><a name="pos2675"></a>ADV MPSHE	163	CAPT HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line2676"><a name="pos2676"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	Go ahead, maybe you will cover the point which I wanted to cover.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2677"><a name="pos2677"></a>ADV MPSHE:   Captain, in your application page 127 thereof, you're asking for amnesty on "opsetlike </p>
<p class="line" id="line2678"><a name="pos2678"></a>saakbeskadiging asook brandstigting", but you haven't told this Committee anything about those two </p>
<p class="line" id="line2679"><a name="pos2679"></a>incidents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2680"><a name="pos2680"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	I think it was rectified.  I think Adv du Plessis submitted a rectified schedule in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2681"><a name="pos2681"></a>which those errors had been rectified.  The rectification had been made, there was no damage to property, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2682"><a name="pos2682"></a>hope it is contained in that schedule.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2683"><a name="pos2683"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:   I just want to clear this because earlier on, by reason of the fact that the name of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2684"><a name="pos2684"></a>Captain van Jaarsveld was mentioned, immediately after a sentence which made reference to the South </p>
<p class="line" id="line2685"><a name="pos2685"></a>African Defence Force, I was under the impression that he was attached to the South African Defence </p>
<p class="line" id="line2686"><a name="pos2686"></a>Force.  He was in fact in the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2687"><a name="pos2687"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	He was my second in command, Captain van Jaarsveld was our acting </p>
<p class="line" id="line2688"><a name="pos2688"></a>Commander, yes, acting Commander.  JUDGE MGOEPE:   But is he not the person who asked you to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2689"><a name="pos2689"></a>come and trace the victim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2690"><a name="pos2690"></a>CAPT HECHTER:   According to what I can deduce from Warrant Officer van Vuuren, I think that was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2691"><a name="pos2691"></a>the case.  I can't remember this specific incident, but if he says so, it is so because he was in control.  Then </p>
<p class="line" id="line2692"><a name="pos2692"></a>he would have addressed the request to me and I would have sent out the people to go and pick up the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2693"><a name="pos2693"></a>person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2694"><a name="pos2694"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	Yes in fact I think this is what Mr van Vuuren says, that you were asked by, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2695"><a name="pos2695"></a>was not at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2696"><a name="pos2696"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line2697"><a name="pos2697"></a>ADV MPSHE	164	CAPT HECHTER</p>
<p class="line" id="line2698"><a name="pos2698"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	No, no, we were never.  Captain van Jaarsveld, Warrant Officer van Vuuren </p>
<p class="line" id="line2699"><a name="pos2699"></a>and myself were never stationed at Vlakplaas, we were just in the Security Branch of Pretoria or the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2700"><a name="pos2700"></a>Northern Transvaal, we had no ties with Vlakplaas, we never liaised with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2701"><a name="pos2701"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:	If in fact the instruction to, or the request to trace the victim did come from </p>
<p class="line" id="line2702"><a name="pos2702"></a>Captain van Jaarsveld, it would have meant that it was a request that came from the Security Branch </p>
<p class="line" id="line2703"><a name="pos2703"></a>anyway?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2704"><a name="pos2704"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	It is possible.  You see in the mornings, and we touched on that last year, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2705"><a name="pos2705"></a>had the joint management centre which consisted of the various sections or departments including Civil </p>
<p class="line" id="line2706"><a name="pos2706"></a>Defence, the Defence Force, National Intelligence and ourselves, we met and problem cases were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2707"><a name="pos2707"></a>discussed with reference not only to problem persons, but also to problem cases where for example there </p>
<p class="line" id="line2708"><a name="pos2708"></a>was bad sewerage systems, these were all discussed at these meetings and I suspect that it was on this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2709"><a name="pos2709"></a>occasion that the request was addressed to Captain van Jaarsveld, whether we couldn't trace this man for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2710"><a name="pos2710"></a>them, because they were unable</p>
<p class="line" id="line2711"><a name="pos2711"></a>to trace him.	They were situated on top of the hill in Mamelodi and they also had their problems </p>
<p class="line" id="line2712"><a name="pos2712"></a>finding people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2713"><a name="pos2713"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	Could we just have clarity in this regard,  did you ever operate under the orders of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2714"><a name="pos2714"></a>Brigadier Cronje?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2715"><a name="pos2715"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	Yes, but at that stage he was the Head of the Security Branch, not at Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2716"><a name="pos2716"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	So when he was at Vlakplaas, you were not under his command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2717"><a name="pos2717"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	No, I only got to know him when he took over as Commanding Officer of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2718"><a name="pos2718"></a>Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2719"><a name="pos2719"></a>ADV DE JAGER:	You yourself were never stationed at </p>

<p class="line" id="line2723"><a name="pos2723"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	No, not at all Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2724"><a name="pos2724"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	Captain Hechter, when exactly did Brigadier Cronje come over from Vlakplaas </p>
<p class="line" id="line2725"><a name="pos2725"></a>to the Security  Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2726"><a name="pos2726"></a>CAPT HECHTER:	I am not sure, I suspect it was about 1986, late 1985, it must have been then </p>
<p class="line" id="line2727"><a name="pos2727"></a>late 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2728"><a name="pos2728"></a>JUDGE MALL:   We've already had (...indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2729"><a name="pos2729"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Yes, Mr Chairman the evidence was led right at the beginning.  It makes it very </p>
<p class="line" id="line2730"><a name="pos2730"></a>difficult the time period inbetween, because a lot of the issues and the aspects which seem to create certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line2731"><a name="pos2731"></a>problems, have already long ago been dealt with in evidence, but obviously nobody's recollection is so </p>
<p class="line" id="line2732"><a name="pos2732"></a>good that one can remember everything, but that was dealt with specifically in the evidence previously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2733"><a name="pos2733"></a>JUDGE MALL:	No further questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2734"><a name="pos2734"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:	No further questions, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
