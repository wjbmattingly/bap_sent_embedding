With regard to the video cassettes made available to us, one of these cassettes, tape number six, very clearly dealing with the interrogation of Mr Walus by Captain Deetliefs, I know that Adv Bizos' attorney also looked at this cassette, watched it and the person in control of the sound system was asked this morning whether he could possibly test the cassette for me as well, because his apparatus is much stronger than the type that one has at home, but the sound does not come through at all in this particular interrogation.  Captain Holmes, yesterday was requested by me to see if there were, perhaps, other tapes relating to the interrogation and he informed me that Captain Nick Deetliefs, the person who did the interrogation, was in possession of the same tape, but with the sound being of a better quality. I would like to request the Committee that Captain Holmes be instructed to place us in possession of that cassette, because it is absolutely essential before Mr Walus can testify to look at this tape and I would not like a delay at a later stage.

Then the further statement here, the Durban Regional Chamber of Business, Mr Chairman, said nothing about business confidence, it said that, \n\"Rampages in Durban on Wednesday by ANC supporters were inexcusable.\".\nThen, Mr Chairman, the Southern Natal ANC Alliance said,\n\"Disciplinary steps would be taken against the unruly elements once they had been identified.\".\nNothing to do with business confidence and I am submitting, Mr Chairman, that always under situations like this journalists use people to exaggerate the situation and if you look at these other statements that Mr Bizos is referring to, Mr Chairman, there are a number of repeats.

I took the matter to the Media Council and at the Media Council, ruled in my favour that, in fact, I had not made that statement and when the journalist concerned was asked to produce the tape, because I insisted with journalists, because by that stage I had learnt what devious means these liberal journalists used to mislead the public, Mr Chairman, I insisted on the journalist concerned sitting there with a tape recorder to record every word we said.  Mr Chairman, when the Media Council called for the production of that tape, as is now the case, apparently, with these tapes here, they were untraceable and then the story came back from the Editor that it had been taped over.  Very conveniently taped over so that they could not produce the tape which would support what I had said, because I took that precaution.

They are perfectly entitled to that, Mr Chairman.  But surely, Mr Chairman, if one looks at world history, surely, Mr Chairman, if, even if one looks at South African history, recent and in the long term, it is clear, for example, that when the British compelled the Afrikaner to come into the Union of South Africa, we know the history of that, it was written into the Constitution at the time, categorically, that the Union of South Africa was the land of White South Africans.\n\tAnd, Mr Chairman, in the process of drawing up that Constitution and doing what they did with the boundaries of the country and remembering that certain trust lands were not part of, part and parcel of the Union of South Africa, they were recognised as belonging to the various peoples who were still located within the boundaries.  \n\tAnd considering, Mr Chairman, that the British Government established Lesotho as the independent territory for the South Sotho people and considering that the Swazis got the territory of Swaziland and that the Tswanas were accorded Bophuthatswana, Mr Chairman, I do not think it was unreasonable at that time, I do not think it was unreasonable at that time for White South Africa also to be accorded a territory and I think that in the interests of peace and reconciliation, that was done.  \n\tMr Chairman, we in the Conservative Party, have always questioned, we've always questioned, Mr Chairman, whether the people who were allowed to vote in 1994 were actually entitled to vote in view of the perfidy of the total political dishonesty perpetrated by Mr de Klerk whom, as I testified, was aware of the fact in 1990 already, that he no longer represented the people that he entered into negotiations on behalf of, and he was using the military and the SAP to protect his position in spite of the fact that he broke a mandate.  We had a rotten Constitution at the time.  We were not able, in terms of our Constitution, to take Mr de Klerk to court.  Otherwise I can assure you, Mr Chairman, had that possibility been contained in the Constitution at that time, Mr F W de Klerk would have been impeached for what he did, because he, by his own admission, betrayed the mandate given to him by the voter.  \n\tSo, that is the background, Mr Chairman, and I think that makes it clear how I feel on that and why I still believe that we Afrikaners are entitled to a territory of our own where we can exercise self-determination over our own affairs in Southern Africa, wherever it may be.",
