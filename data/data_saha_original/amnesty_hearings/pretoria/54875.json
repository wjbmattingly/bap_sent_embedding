Naturally, the third war of freedom has begun, said Mr Du Plessis, but the fact that I say this here today, does not oblige you to go out tomorrow and plant bombs.  \n\t\tThere had been 30 000 people at the Voortrekkerhoogte meeting where Dr Treurnicht made the statement. How many of those people went and planted bombs?  Dr Treurnicht had said that anyone who planted bombs did so at his own risk, knowing that he was contravening the laws of the land, and that he would have to bear the blame and the punishment. If Mr Botha had indeed blown up Hillview School, the question arose whether he had not known the consequences.  Mr Botha had naturally been alone when he was finally brought to court.

You know, our nation, the Afrikaner nation has a history of protest and sometimes they used weapons to protest, but that is not to make a war, but to make sure that the people know that we are serious and the fact is, that we has a right as a nation to freedom and self-determination.  And what is happening at the moment in the country, points to a situation where the Communist is going to take over this country, and that we will never accept.  And therefore, we say if that happens in South Africa, it will not be accepted by our nation, and therefore, we say at the beginning of this century we fought a war against the biggest country in the world, for our freedom.  And don't push us too far because if you take that risk, that might happen again and that is why the Conservative Party put our case, we made the statement and we propose the policy just to prevent that situation.\nMR VENTER\n\t\tSo you are saying if, if this takeover that you are talking about, then a violent resistance to it. So it is a situation that hasn't arisen yet?\nDR FERDIE HARTZENBERG\n\t\tLook, Mr Venter, we have watched the news tonight and we have seen the violence in Yugoslavia. It is being created as a result of a political situation, and the Government and the ANC want to create the same situation in South Africa. And we will not be responsible for what is going to happen if that situation is created in South Africa.  We warned them, but we are not going to accept a Communist government over our nation.\nMR VENTER\n\t\tI would like to return to that point, but talking about the news, the item relevant there was that the European Parliament is going to investigate rightwing connections between Europe and South Africa.  Now this flows from the connections of members such as Mr Derby-Lewis and the various organisations.\nDR FERDIE HARTZENBERG\n\t\tJa.\nMR VENTER\n\t\tAny comments on this investigation, that will touch your party?\nDR FERDIE HARTZENBERG\n\t\tIf you will allow me I will answer this one in Afrikaans.\nMR VENTER\n\t\tPlease.\nDR FERDIE HARTZENBERG\n\t\tDit is vir my 'n groot verrassing dat hulle nou die konneksie tussen mnr Derby-Lewis en sekere regse groepe in Europa wil ondersoek. Hoekom ondersoek hulle nie die konneksies tussen politieke leiers in Afrika met Kommunistiese Partye in Europa nie?  Hoekom ondersoek die Europese Parlement nie die uitlatings wat mev Winnie Mandela gemaak het, naamlik dat die ANC verantwoordelik is vir hierdie moord en dat sy twee name genoem het, en dat hulle nou daaroor begaan is. Ek dink hierdie hele poging is daarop gemik om die aandag af te trek van die geweld wat veroorsaak is deur die Regering en die ANC. Hulle is verantwoordelik daarvoor. Nou word daar 'n sondebok gesoek.  \nMNR VENTER\n\t\tMaar die Europese Parlement (onduidelik) en hulle sameswering (onduidelik).\nDR FERDIE HARTZENBERG\n\t\tDie Europese Parlement wil graag he dit wat die Regering en die ANC voorstel moet plaasvind in Suid-Afrika, en hulle weet net so goed soos ons weet, hier is te veel weerstand daarteen, nie net van ons nie, maar van baie ander partye, nasies, state in Suid-Afrika wat nie die situasie wil he nie.\nMR VENTER\n\t\tTalking about resistance, Dr Hartzenberg, and before you leave the  Afrikaans ...(intervention)\nDR FERDIE HARTZENBERG\n\t\tJa.\nMR VENTER\n\t\tYou said yesterday in Parliament \"die volk sal in opstand moet kom teen oorname\".  The nation will have to come, a rising resistance against the take-over of the ANC and the SACP. Do you accept that such a take-over might be the logical democratic outcome of an open election in South Africa?\nDR FERDIE HARTZENBERG\n\t\tWell, I don't think there will be an open election in South Africa.\nMR VENTER\n\t\tWhy not?\nDR FERDIE HARTZENBERG\n\t\tIn the first instance because \n\t\tas I have said just now, the Government and the ANC already agreed on the election of a constituent assembly and on a transitional executive council.  \nMR VENTER\n\t\tIs that not an election?\nDR FERDIE HARTZENBERG\n\t\tThat is not an election if now they must negotiate it and they must determine whether other parties also support it. But now the ANC announced that they are going with mass action to determine these things. In other words, they are not interested in negotiations.\nMR VENTER\n\t\tDoes that mean that you are opposed to an open free election in the country?\nDR FERDIE HARTZENBERG\n\t\tOf course, we believe that there must be elections for the nations and the states who prefer to be free and have self-determination.\nMR VENTER\n\t\tIf the drive towards negotiations which it clearly is at the moment, is to the creation of such an election, what is the CP doing in those negotiations?\nDR FERDIE HARTZENBERG\n\t\tLaat ek net vir jou een ding vertel, en dit is, minstens ons volk is nie te vinde vir 'n oorheersing deur die ANC en die Kommunistiese Party of enigiemand anders nie. Ons is nie die enigste nie. Daar is ander state en ander volke wat dieselfde wil he en ons doel is om juis dit by die onderhandelingstafel duidelik te stel, sodat daar voorsiening voor gemaak kan word.  En as daarvoor voorsiening gemaak word, dit is wat ons voorstel, dat state en volke wat vry wil wees en selfbeskikking wil he en onafhanklik self wil wees, dat hulle moet toegelaat word om te doen. Alleen dan kan jy vrede in Suid-Afrika he, maar as 'n meerderheid 'n klomp volke wil oorheers, sal jy nooit vrede in Suid-Afrika he nie. En dit is presies wat ons by die onderhandelingstafel voor gesorg het dat selfbeskikking op die lys kom.\nMR VENTER\n\t\tGranted. But if the negotiations carry on the track that they are at the moment, and that is the end goal being immediate, end goal being an open election, are you saying that the Conservative Party will pull out of those negotiations?\nDR FERDIE HARTZENBERG\n\t\tWe have only one point on our agenda, and whether we fight elections or we participate in Parliament or in any form or in mobilisation, we have only one point on our agenda, and that is the freedom and self-determination of our nation.\nMR VENTER\n\t\tDr Hartzenberg ... (intervention).\nDR FERDIE HARTZENBERG\n\t\tAnd if it becomes clear that negotiations will not deliver that, then it will be meaningless to participate, then we will sign our own funeral arrangements and we are not going to do that, we are not prepared to do that.\nMR VENTER\n\t\tDr Hartzenberg, thank you very much.  That is from us in Parliament in Cape Town, back to you, Penny.\"",

Clive and I therefore highlighted the names of the people whom we believed to be the enemies of South Africa.  Certain names were added to the list I sent to Arthur, such as Justice Goldstone and certain newspaper people.  Goldstone's address was needed to determine where he lived, because I wanted to do an article as to how he, who helped to break down the Group Areas Act, was now living in a White area far away from the results of his 1984 Govender judgment. The journalists' addresses were requested because I wanted to write to them about their attitude towards this (indistinct). I asked for Mr Pik Botha's address because there was strong rumours that he owned property overseas and this had been reported in the Afrikaner newspaper and perhaps the company which owned his property, if indeed it was the case, would be the same company. The people on the list whom I believed to be the enemies of South Africa, were the participants in Operation Vula, who were never prosecuted by the government and members of the ANC and South African Communist Party.  Some of the names were Maharaj, Hani, Mandela, Kasrils, Naidoo, Ramaphosa, Slovo.  Clive and Kuba decided on Chris Hani to be eliminated because of his particularly brutal record and his position as chairman of the South African Communist Party, which they believed never should have been unbanned.\"\nThis is what your wife wrote down and signed and took an oath that it was correct.  \n\tNow I am not asking you to pass judgment on the correctness or other, or anything else about your wife's statement.  But I want you to please look at Annexure, page 30, the description of Mr Mandela's house and the contents of your wife's statement.

They must be moved voluntarily and I believe they moved in that area because industrial development was taking place, Mr Chairman, and if I can use Bophuthatswana as an example, that is proof of that.  Bophuthatswana was the economic success story of the policy of separate development.",

Because if there are two nations in the world who are more at loggerheads with the English than the Germans and the Scots, I would like to know.
