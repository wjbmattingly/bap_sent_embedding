            "Mr Chairman, there is something that I wish to place on record which happened outside these proceedings.\n\tMrs Derby-Lewis, Mr Chairman, who is a person mentioned in the evidence saw fit yesterday to hold a press conference in which she made a number of statements which affect our professional conduct and also affect the reputations of witnesses who may give evidence here.\n\tI do not want Mr Chairman, to become involved in a war of words with Mrs Derby-Lewis, but I am going to ask you Mr Chairman, to say to her that it is considered improper for her to comment outside this court as to the manner in which we do our work and her opinions about witnesses.\n\tOne of the most damaging things that she said was that we were going to lead evidence of known torturers which evidence we scraped from the bottom of the barrel.  In defence of our professional integrity and for the credibility of the witnesses that may be called, I want to read firstly to hand in, copies of a letter on President Council letterheads, written by Mr Derby-Lewis to the Colonel in charge of the investigation on 16th of May 1993 in order to show that if we did get this from the bottom of the barrel, it was a statement which completely contradicts her statement that we are relying on evidence obtained under torture.\n\tThe letter reads \n\"President's Council, P.O. Box 1462, Klerksdorp, 1749.\n\t\tDear Colonel, just a brief letter to you and your staff in order to thank you for the decent way in which you had treated me during my time spent in detention in Benoni.\n\t\tI also wish to congratulate you with a very good team and I would like to request you to give my good wishes to one and all and wish them luck for the future.  Once again, thank you very much.\n\t\tI shall remember you all with positive thoughts.  \n\t\tKind regards, Clive Derby-Lewis.  \n\t\tWhen this is all over, I shall once again one day go and visit you.\"\n\tNow Mr Chairman, when we tendered the statements made under Section 6 by the two applicants and Mrs Derby-Lewis who on the face of them, appear to be particularly relevant to these proceedings, the Committee was told that they were coerced in making those statements and that they will consider them to be inadmissible.  Mrs Derby-Lewis, outside these proceedings, added colour to those statements and the widest possible publicity was given to her remarks.\n\tI am applying Mr Chairman, that Mrs Derby-Lewis be told that purporting to be a journalist, she is of course free to say whatever she pleases, provided she does not say things which are improper in relation to those who are participating in these proceedings and in relation to witnesses who may come.\n\tI placed on record Mr Chairman, that we believe that the statements were freely and voluntarily made.  It was not a statement which was made without proper information and the letter that I have just produced, may go to show that the claim that they were not freely and voluntarily made, were false and that most certainly the allegations made by Mrs Derby-Lewis outside this room, were false.
