And I'm happy today that the truth has finally surfaced today.\n\tAll the thoughts and allegations have been a lie.  I know nothing, I know nothing about the plans of the death of Brigadier Molope.  I want to stress the fact that me and Molope liked each other very much.  Even on the day of his death he was at my home when I was still staying in Unit 8.  \n\tHe found me at my home with my two younger children.  He told me that he has just arrived from Mafeking and he found nobody at his home.  It was in the afternoon.  We had some tea and thereafter he left with my two children.  We followed each other in our cars, the car that he had used from Mafeking.\n\tWe were on our way to the vegetable store which is Mr Palazi's vegetable market in Boekenhout.  We both bought vegetables and thereafter we went separate ways.  He told me that he was going home and I told him that I am going home as well.\n\tI thought that when he said he was going home he was going to the D Section.  I went back home.  In the afternoon, I don't recall exactly what time but it's between four and 6 o'clock, Maklauli arrived at my home in Unit 8 and I was still with my children when he got there.  At that time he said to me Mr Molope has been shot and hurt.  He didn't say that he is dead.  When he told me, he said that this happened at some house in Beirut.\n\tThat surprised me because I told him that: \"No, I was with him a while ago and we both bought vegetables, he's gone home, have you just heard this from people\"?  I told him that this is not hearsay, I've seen him, I've seen ...[indistinct] to come and call you.  I did not know that place that he was referring to, not at all.\n\tWe both left and he showed me where Mr Molope was killed.  When I got there he was already taken to hospital.  We went to the hospital and I found him there but unfortunately he was already dead when I got there. Therefore I would like to thank this Commission that - because no-one ever thought what the truth was and everybody was confused, including myself and Mrs Molope.  \tNow the truth has come out, even if they are disagreeing with the truth that has been told here, but now they know who exactly did this.  There is nothing else I can say but I want to stress is that I've got no links with these gentlemen.  I've never had any links with them before and I don't even know them.  That is all I can say, thank you.",

            "Thank you Mr Chairman, my learned friend, Mr Mpshe.\n\tWe'd respectfully submit then that the application complies with the requirements of the Act, that the formal requirements have been fulfilled.\n\tSub-Section 2 deals with what is meant by an act associated with a political objective.  We'd respectfully submit that it is common cause that all four the applicants were members of the ANC, were members of Umkhonto weSizwe and so they would fulfil the requirements of Section 2(a).  They also fulfil the requirements of Section 2(d).  They've each testified insofar as they have knowledge of the mandate given to the unit, primarily from the evidence of the applicant, Masina but they've each confirmed that that was their understanding.\n\tThe act which they were involved in, the act which is before this Committee, was the death of a senior Boputhatswana policeman.  And we would submit to that, that that fulfils the requirements of (d) in that it was an act directed against the state.\n\tWhat has been raised through the family of the deceased, was the question of the bona fides of the applicants.  In other words, was this a political act or was this an act for which they received payment, an act on behalf of a rival of the deceased.  We would submit that there is no evidence to support that, there is no evidence whatsoever.\n\tAs we said earlier, they each testified to the mandate, they've each testified to the manner in which the deceased was identified as a legitimate target.  In this regard the evidence of Masango is particularly relevant.  And the person on whose behalf they would purportedly have carried out this private vendetta has denied that.  There is no link whatsoever between Mokobojane and the four applicants.\n\tInsofar as there may be a question in respect of the involvement of the applicant Potsane, we would submit to that the requirements of 2(f) have been fulfilled.",

            "Yes, we would agree with that.  There is also the doctrine of common purpose which would come into it.\n\tIf one then has reference to the criteria set out in Section 20, Sub 3, the motive of each of the applicants has been covered in their formal written application.  The context of the act or the context in which the act took place was summarised by the witness we called, Mr Lehobye.\n\tThe legal and factual nature of the act is probably best encapsulated by the evidence of the applicant Makhura.  We heard from each of the applicants how the target was identified.  We'd from the applicant, Masango in respect of the reconnaissance and the preparatory work that was done, but at the end of the day the act was the death of Brigadier Molope.  \n\tThere is the question of the proportionality of the act.  We heard this morning a suggestion that Molope died in a hail of bullets.  It would appear that he was shot 21 times but it is not as if Molope was kidnapped and tortured to death, it's not as if, it's difficult to say that this was a plain and straightforward assassination but that is really what it was.\n\tThere was also the evidence of the applicant, Makhura, in respect of what arms and ammunition he had available to him and there was nothing which prevented them from throwing a handgrenade into the house.  \tThere was direct evidence from Masango and from Makhura in respect of the civilians present on the premises.  There was evidence that there was a woman and a child on the premises and that steps were taken to ensure that they were not caught in the cross-fire.\n\tI would submit that what the applicants sought to achieve and the means which they used to achieve that, that those were proportionate in the overall context of the struggle in South Africa. \n\tIn respect of an order, they've testified to a broad mandate.  The fact that the unit was tasked, that it was an elimination or an assassination unit and that it was tasked by Chris Hani with a category or categories of the persons who would be legitimate targets.  There is also the evidence that they reported back on this incident and on other incidents.\n\tThere is no evidence of any personal malice on the part of the applicants against the deceased.  There is also no evidence of any personal gain.  It is so that the four applicants are now in one or other form employees of the state with the exception of the applicant Mr Masango.",

It would have been very easy for the applicants, Masina and Potsane to say that all they had was knowledge but each and every one of them has associated themselves with the act, has associated themselves with the target identification and with the ends sought to be achieved.\n\tThere is the painful aspect that the elimination took place at the home of the lover of the deceased but that was something that was particularly relevant and which had to come out.
