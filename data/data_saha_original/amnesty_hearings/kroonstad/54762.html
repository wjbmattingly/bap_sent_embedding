<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>AMNESTY HEARINGS</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  For the purposesof the record I introduce myself, T V Matsepe of the same firmT V Matsepe and Company practising at Odendaalsrus.  Mr ChairmanI just want to point out from the onset that I shall lead, indeedstart leading the evidence of Petros, but must also point outto the Committee that I have instructions to appear on behalfof five applicants.  For the purposes of the convenience of thedeliberations I have opted to lead the evidence of all the fiveapplicants that I am appearing on behalf of, and then later onlead the evidence of any further witnesses which we might deemnecessary.  The reason for this Mr Chairman is that the circumstancessurrounding the incidents relating to these applications are allto a great extent similar, and in that way we hope that we shallbe sparing a lot of time for the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a> Before I continue I would just like to confirm Mr Roland, MrChairman I am led to believe that before I lead the evidence ofthe first applicant Roland Petros it would be necessary for himto take the oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">ROLAND PETROS:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Roland I would like you to feel completelyat ease.  Is that in order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Before we start with your evidence Iwould like to know from you do you realise what the nature oftoday's proceedings is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes I understand it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Do you also understand that this is nota court case in the sense that you are being tried, do you understandthat?  Do you realise that this is not a trial in the sense thatyou are not standing there as an accused in a trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Do you also realise that you must bevery open with this Committee, for instance if you had appearedin court in a case arising from the same incident, you must justrealise that today's proceedings demands of you that you makea full disclosure of the facts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> In other words you must not conceal orhide anything from the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes, no, absolutely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Firstly I would like you to tell theCommission where you were born and when you were born.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>You may continue, where were you born?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> I was born in Johannesburg, El dorado Park,in 28 Sand Street, 1969.  I then moved to Ennerdale to CancerStreet, Ennerdale.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> You see there are people here in theaudience who would also like to hear what you have to say.  Theyare very interested in your evidence and therefore I would liketo ask you could you please speak a little bit louder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Please explain to the committee whatyour links are with Kroonstad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> My father was born in Kroonstad, Mr PhilipPetros, and his entire family also born here, the entire Petrosfamily.  I spent most of my early years in Kroonstad with membersof the Petros family.  So a large part of my life I spent in Kroonstadrather in Johannesburg where I'd been born.  It's a very largefamily the Petros family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Now did you visit Kroonstad regularlyduring the period in which this incident took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes, frequently, and also before the incidenttook place I visited Kroonstad regularly.  I spent the majorityof my time here rather than in Johannesburg where I was born.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Ja, could you just explain why that isso? Seeing that you were born in Johannesburg and your parentslived there why did you spend such a large part of your time inKroonstad?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Well the reason for that is because I wasinvolved in the ANC Youth League in Kroonstad and that's why Ispent a lot of time here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Were you a member of the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> What time were you a member of the ANCYouth League, even if you can just give us an approximate time,even if it's not a specific date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> From approximately 1980, I can't rememberexactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Were you involved in the activities ofthe Youth League during 1991 and 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes in some cases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Ja you were convicted in a matter arisingfrom the murder of George Ramasimong whose nickname was "Diwiti".</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> And you were sentenced for this murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> I would like you to explain to the committeewhat you knew of this particular person before we get to the actualevent, what do you know about the deceased, how did you get toknow him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> I met the deceased in the community as a callous,cruel, merciless person, who terrorised the community day in andday out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> And how did you become aware of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Well that was because of my involvement withthe ANC Youth League, and because I was often with Senator Bloemin his company.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Now could you explain to the Committeewho Senator Bloem was at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Senator Bloem is one of my cousins, actuallymy father's cousin, in fact he's my uncle.</p>

<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> According to information which you hadobtained who was responsible for this murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes I was worried ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> No, who had been responsible for themurder, according to what you had learnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Diwiti and the Three Million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> How had he been killed?</p>

<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes, there had been many meetings regardingthis gang.  Yes, there were many different meetings held to discussthe problem presented by this gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Was a meeting held at which specificmention was made of the possibility of killing George Ramasimong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes such a meeting was held.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Could you give us some more details regardingthis meeting, where was it held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> It was held at Brent Park Stadium.  I can'texactly remember who attended the meeting, everybody who attendedthe meeting, but in the meeting a request came from the communityto the self-protection unit to remove this George Ramasimong fromsociety because of the way he terrorised society in various cold-bloodedways.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Right.  Was it as a result of this meetingthat you acted in the way that you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes, yes there was an order from the communityto remove this person and this order was given at this particularmeeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> What did you decide to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> The instruction wasn't aimed specificallyat myself, but specifically everybody, any member of the self-protectionunit who found this person could kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Your testimony is then that you weren'tspecifically approached and asked as an individual to kill thisperson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> What appeared from the meeting was thatanybody who came into contact with this particular person couldkill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Right, I'd like to get to the actualday of the incident.  What happened, what did you do on the dayof this particular incident?  Let me put it this way perhaps tokeep my questioning brief, do you confirm your explanation ofplea tendered in the Supreme Court when you pleaded guilty tothe murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> You then went to the taxi rank whereyou shot Diwiti dead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> After this person's death is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> At the start of the court proceedingsyou pleaded not guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> But later on you did plead guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Could you explain to the Committee whyyou decided to change your plea to one of guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Initially they wanted me to plead guilty butthey wanted me to place all the blame on Senator Bloem so thathe could go to prison for the act which I had committed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> I would just like to repeat my question,what I would like to know is initially you did not plead guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> But later on you decided you were goingto change your plea, in other words you decided to admit thatyou had killed this person and that you had the intent to killhim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes I am sorry I misunderstood the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Why the change of plea?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Well I felt that I wanted to be entirely honestand truthful with the State.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Do you know what happened after the deathof this person as regards the violence which took place in thevicinity, in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Peace had been restored to the communities,it did take a little bit of time however.  From the time of hisdeath until this time there has been peace in our community, theentire community can confirm that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> How do you feel about the fact that youcommitted this act?  How do you feel about that right now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> I feel very bad about it, I feel very sorryabout the fact that I committed this deed.  I didn't want to commitit in the first place but because we had nobody else to protectus at that stage we had to protect ourselves and defend ourselves. This person should not have been dead today and I'm actuallyvery sorry that he is dead.  But if the South African Police hadhelped us then this person would never have died.  I am very sorrythat this person is dead because he was actually also an innocentperson who had been used by the SAP.  For that reason I'd liketo say, perhaps if his mother and other members of his familyare present, I would like to say that I am very sorry and I'dlike to ask their forgiveness.  I would want them to forgive meas God forgives us.  I am sorry that I killed this person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> In other words what you are telling theCommittee is that you are sorry that you had to be the personresponsible for executing the sentiments and demands of your society?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes the instructions came from the communityitself and was directed at us because we protected and defendedthe community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> You say that George Ramasimong was usedby the then South African Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Why do you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> I killed this person and I got 14 years imprisonmentfor this deed but this same person killed 102 people and thereis proof of that.  But this person didn't even receive 14 secondsof imprisonment for his deeds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> If it pleases you Mr Chairman I am justgoing through.  I still think that this question has not beenclearly answered, do you have any information, whether personallyor information that has been given to you that led to the conclusionthat the South African Police at the time were colluding and conspiringwith the Three Million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes, I am sorry I haven't yet fully answeredthe question.  Evidence proves that this person was involved andcooperated with the South African Police in that he was neverarrested for any act committed by him.  This person was transportedin SAP bakkies and so on, and dropped off in various areas ofthe community to terrorise them and he was present when the SAPkilled certain members of the community.  Further evidence alsoshows that this person was given bail for each and every act thathe committed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Do you have any information regardingthe relationship between George Ramasimong and the then Prosecutor,Miss Pienaar, or Mrs Pienaar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> There was a time when we were looking forthis person to remove him from society and as a result of thathe received certain information and went and hid himself at MrsPienaar's home.  As a result of this we knew that this personcolluded with the South African Police, because this person wentinto hiding at that particular place for his own safety and wecouldn't understand why he couldn't be kept in safe detentionat the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Do you also have information that MrsPienaar had confirmed this, in other words that the Prosecutorhad confirmed this fact and she did not deny that Ramasimong hadcome to her house to hide?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes she admitted that and confirmed that. She confirmed that she had done that and we have evidence tothat effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Now these things, for instance the factthat there were allegations that police were conspiring with thegang, allegations that the police, that the leader of the gangsometimes went to sleep over at the home of the Prosecutor, whatfeelings did this evoke from yourself and the community?  Yousee now you were given the information and you heard the allegationsregarding police conspiracy, allegations were made about the factthat certain people were charged but soon let out on bail andthere were allegations that the leader of the gang sought safetyat the Prosecutor's home and stayed there for a while, now inthe light of all this information which you had, how did you feel? What I would like to establish, and what I'd like you to explainto the Committee is after you saw these things happening or heardthat these things were happening, how did you feel, did you feelsafe and secure or did you feel threatened and afraid?  What wenton in your mind at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> At that stage we felt that we are not safe.We felt that there was nobody to defend us and to protect us. We felt that there was no justice for us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR T V MATSEPE:</span> Did you have any faith and confidencein the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> No, none at all, I had no confidence in theprevious dispensation and system.</p>

<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> I can't remember exactly who brought thisinstruction to us.  I think I arrived at the meeting five minuteslate.  The meeting had already started.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> If you could speak a little bit louder, wehave got a problem with hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> I say I cannot remember who brought us theparticular instruction to our meeting because I arrived a bitlate at the meeting and the time that I arrived there the meetingwas already under way.</p>

<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Now where did you get the firearm from, theone which you used in killing Diwiti?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> I got the firearm from Sergeant Jacobs. SergeantJacobs, I think he was stationed at Langlaagte Police Station. I obtained the firearm from him to complete my shooting lessonswhich (Side A of tape 1 ends).  ...training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You had dealings with the police yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> No.  This person loaned me the firearm.  Atthat stage I was struggling to get my firearm licence so the firearmis given to me so that I could complete my training in order toobtain the licence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Is there any relationship between yourselfand this policeman who gave you the firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> No, no there was no relationship between thetwo of us.  We just attended the same church at some stage andI know that he was a good person.  At the stage when he gave methe firearm he did not know anything about the act which I wasplanning to commit with the firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> But you've testified Mr Petros that you hadno confidence in the police because the police were assistingthe Three Million gang, how do you explain your getting a firearmfrom the very police you don't have confidence in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> This person lives in Johannesburg and he wasnot aware of circumstances in Kroonstad at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Am I right then to understand you to be sayingthat when you say you do not have confidence in the police youare referring in particular to the Kroonstad police only?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes that is entirely correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> In your evidence when led you simply statedthat you killed the deceased at a taxi rank, could you tell usin detail how you did this, how you planned this, let us knowexactly what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> I walked up to this person, this person GeorgeRamasimong was with his gang.  I think there were about 12 or15 of them I can't remember exactly, because they knew me I worea balaclava so they wouldn't identify me because if they had identifiedme and recognised me they would have attacked me and not the otherway round, so I was wearing this balaclava to stop them from recognisingmy face.  The person walked to the taxi rank and walked througha passage, a little gate there, entered through the gate to thetaxi rank.  I was walking in amongst the members of the ThreeMillion, I walked up to him, I took out the firearm, went up tohim and a couple of the gang members behind me shouted at him,he turned around, he looked in my direction, he saw me approachingwith a firearm and he tried to run away, I shot. various shotsat him and he ran round the combi's at the taxi rank and the fenceis quite high on the other side so he couldn't run away.  So heactually cornered himself there, he turned around, he ran backtowards me, I ran towards him, I think I caused him to fall bykicking him on his chest, he tried to get up again whilst I wasstanding there, I knocked his feet out from under him so he felldown again, I then put my foot on his head and while he was lyingon the ground I shot him in the head.  I turned around again,I was alone, there was nobody else there and I then went backto the car, I ran away in the direction of the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Mr Petros you have testified and you said youare sorry for what you have done, you asked for forgiveness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> In killing the deceased Diwiti do you thinkthat measure was justified to take human life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> No it was not justified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Do you then agree with me that taking the circumstancesthat prevailed there, between yourself, that is your group andthe Three Million gang you went overboard by killing the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> I never wanted to kill this man.  It was neverour plan to kill him but we had no choice but to kill him becausethere was nobody who could protect us, nobody who could complainabout this man and to seek help against all his actions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> No Mr Petros after killing this man was thereany political change in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Since this man died, up until today, but notimmediately, I think it took a couple of months after his death,but up until today there's been a change in our society, thereis peace and stability.  The community is here to verify that,what I have just said now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Petros I think thereis something that I think you must give a little bit more clarityto.  Now I think you need to just clarify something for us, Iwill try and lead you, this meeting to which we have now referredto at such a meeting could you perhaps tell us how this particularkind of meeting proceeds?  In other words is it a very formalkind of meeting or does it take place very informally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> It took place in a very informal way becauseat that stage it was easier for our enemies to kill us when wewere all gathered together like that so the meetings were veryinformal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Is it so that there was a secretary that tookdown the minutes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> No, that did not happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> And when people were given opportunities toask questions how did they do that?  At these meetings when peoplewanted to make some kind of contribution or input or ask questionshow was it done, how did it happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> He simply voiced his opinion and then we sawwhat kind of feedback we could give him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> In other words a person could simply get upat the meeting and simply state what he had to say, he could simplysay no we can't continue with this, he must be killed, any individualcould do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> How do you think - in other words support thatposition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Everybody supported the same point of viewso all the people at the meeting were in favour of this view.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> How do you come to the conclusion that thatview was the general attitude and view of the people at the meeting,how did you become aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> Could you repeat that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> How would you at such a meeting, how wouldyou be able to determine that a view voiced by any particularperson was the view of the entire meeting?  How could you be surethat an individual's view had the support of the entire meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETROS:</span> The command was directed at all of us.</p>

Or let me put it to you this way among the people killed werethere people that you considered as leaders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> Yes some of these people I did regard as leadersand exemplary residents of the community.</p>

<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> We often went to the South African Police andpleaded with them to help us to solve this problem, the problemof the gang and the more we went to them to ask for help the worsethings became.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You were asked by Advocate ...(indistinct)to whether you thought the killing of the deceased was justifiedand your answer was - well do you remember what your answer was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> I said no, it was not justified because I didnot want to take the law into my own hands and because I haverespect for human life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Was it necessary to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> It wasn't necessary to kill him but if theSouth African Police had done their job properly it would neverhave been necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Sorry to question you again, reverting to yourlast answer that if the police had done their job it would nothave been necessary to kill the deceased, you remember in yoursupplementary affidavit which you wrote last month you said, andI am reading to you from it,</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>  "On the 25th of February 1992 I armed myself with a firearmand followed him (that is the deceased) to the Kroonstad taxirank as he was coming from court where he had appeared on chargesand murder and attempted murder of ANC members".</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>do you remember saying that in your affidavit? </p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> So he was being charged with the offences ofmurder and attempted murder and facing those charges at the timeyou killed him, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> No, he hadn't been charged with murder, hewas accompanying his gang who was attending court in connectionwith the murder case.  It was not himself who had been charged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Well why did you say this in your affidavit,your attorney prepared it for you, he read it over to you, youswore to it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> Maybe I speak Afrikaans, my attorney speaksEnglish, maybe there was some language confusion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> How many people were charged with the deathof the deceased besides yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> Four, four people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> What happened to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> One was killed, the State withdrew the caseagainst one of them, one became State witness and the one wassentenced with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> To your knowledge is this gang the Three MillionGang no longer in existence or is it still in existence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> I don't know whether they still exist or notbut if they were still in existence there would be no peace inthis community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You were a member of the self-defence unitwere you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Was the self-defence unit itself also an informalorganisation or was it a formal, properly constituted organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> It was a properly constituted body formed aspart of the Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> So you were a member of the self-defence unitand the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> They were almost one and the same thing, theself-defence unit was slightly separate because some of the peoplewho belonged to the defence unit also belonged to the Youth League,they were more-or-less the same thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> The deceased was not a member of any politicalorganisation was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> As I said this person had made a statementthat he was a member of the IFP, that's all I know.  But accordingto how I saw it that was just a smokescreen really.  I don't reallybelieve he was a member of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Mr Petros it seems to me that there is someconfusion about the two meetings which apparently took place. If I understand your evidence correctly the whole community ora large part of the community attended a meeting at which certaindecisions were taken, right, and later whether on the same dayor on the next day there was a meeting of the self-defence unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Did you attend both of these meetings or onlyone of them or neither?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> I only attended one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Which one did you attend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> The meeting of the self-defence unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> So you don't know what decisions were takenat the other meeting except as far as you were informed by theparticular informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> And you also don't know who the person waswho conveyed this information because you arrived late at theself-defence unit's meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> So when you arrived at the meeting, the meetingof the self-defence unit, the discussion had already been disposedof or what exactly happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> It was more-or-less towards the end of the meetingthat I arrived there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> And you said that you got the firearm froma Sergeant Jacobs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Were you friends, you great friends with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> And did you ever discuss these problems withhim, namely the fact that the police in Kroonstad were not attendingto the community's complaints and grievances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> No, never.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> But you had full confidence in this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> Yes as he also had confidence in me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Would it not perhaps have helped if you hadspoken to him about this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Mr Petros in your evidence you've stated thatyou had lost confidence in the police and you had lost confidencein the legal system itself and this is what led the communityto take its decision on the 23rd of February 1992, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Now are you able to enlighten this committeeas to what attempts had been made by the community at large toconvey its problems which it had with the Three Million Gang tothe police in Maokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> We wrote letters to the then Minister of Lawand Order Adrian Vlok to try and address this problem but nothingcame of it.  If I remember correctly there was a Captain Duriesent here to try and solve the problems, the problem was onlysolved temporarily because he was then transferred if my memoryserves me correctly.  The offices in the South African Policehere in Kroonstad even, the General in the Free State vicinity,they were approached regarding the situation here but absolutelynothing was done to solve the problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Now the Captain that you have mentioned CaptainDurie, who sent him?  Are you aware?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> I am not sure who sent him here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> When did the Three Million Gang come into existenceMr Petros?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> I can't remember exactly, I think it was in1990, or maybe 1989, I am not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You have stated in your supplementary affidavitthat initially the Gang committed pure criminal acts, that theGang ultimately took on a political character, do you recall makingthat statement in ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Now what was this political character it assumed? What was it doing for it to assume a political character fromthat of being purely a criminal gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> I am sorry could you repeat the question itwas quite a long question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Let me make it simpler.  In your supplementaryaffidavits you've stated that when the Three Million Gang startedit started as purely a criminal gang but that later on it tookon a political character, I just want to know on what made youto conclude that it had taken a political character?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">R PETROS:</span> These persons claimed that they were supportersof the IFP and they wore red pieces of cloth around their necks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  The applicant now on the stand is tobe cross-examined today.  May I ask that he retakes the oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR H G THULU:</span> Still under oath</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yesterday you testified that in the year 1990you were the organiser of the Youth League and you were electedthe General Commander of the SDUs, is it correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Will I then be correct to state that all actionsor activities taken by the SDUs were taken as a result of yourcommands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Petros testified yesterday as to how he killedDuvidi.  Do you know as to who gave him that instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> By that time I was already in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You don't have any idea as to how did he getthe command to kill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Actually I never gave them an individual command,it was a general command from the onset.  I commanded them todefend the community in all the way they can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Were you aware of a meeting that took placeon the 23rd January 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I wasn't aware, but we usually held such meetings. I was informed about the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Just to be fair to you. It is a meeting testifiedto by Petros where the community was involved where a decisionwas taken.  Did you know about that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I heard about that after.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Were you told as to who chaired the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Do you know as to who was responsible forthe meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> What I knew is that in such meeting only the(inaudible) members were allowed to enter, so my (inaudible) thatthey were members of the SDUs whom I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Do you know anything about the so-called TMK?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> What is it in full?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> In Afrikaans it is TIEN MANNEKRAG.  In our language,cadres, it is TALENTED MEMBERS OF UMKHONTO we SIZWE.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Was this an existing ANC wing or organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> It was a defending structure actually.  Itwas not an ANC structure, but there were people who took initiativeswho proposed the structure must be opened, those who were there,some of them were the members of ANC, the leaders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> When was this TMK formed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Between October month and November 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Formed by whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I was the one who formed it, organised theyouth to join the SDUs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did the TMK have any connection or relationwith the known Umkhonto we Sizwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Actually, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now you testified that George Ramasimong,Duvidi, was previously a member of the Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I want to believe then that if he was a memberof the Youth League previously you were in a position that youcan talk to him and enter into some form of negotiations withhim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now don't you think it would have been better,instead of him being murdered, that negotiations be entered intothrough yourself because you were in good contact with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I knew that very well and I tried it on countlessoccasions, but it failed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> What attempts did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> We once went to a small police station in</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a>Gelukwaarts to go and settle up there the dispute, then we proposeda meeting, a peace meeting which will be held at the Roman CatholicChurch here in Constantia, but at a later stage, maybe after anhour, we hear that they have killed one of the comrades in Pumulang(indistinct), and then by that time the members of the SDUs were(witness speaking indistinctly) they didn't want to listen tome because they were angry.  These people this side they are talkingabout the peace and reconciliation while the other side they arekilling the people.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> So negotiations stopped on that day betweenyourself and Duvidi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Was there any other attempt made by yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.  I once again tried to talk to him incourt at town and then he never wanted to listen to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You testified about a bus that ferried peoplewho had red bands on and were armed to the teeth.  Do you knowthe ownership of the bus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No, I don't know the ownership of the bus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> What bus was it?  Where did it come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> They used to transport the people locallyhere, from here to job and in town.  It is public transport actually.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Oh, it is public transport owned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Which company is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I don't know the company.  I knew the firstcompany which was Greyhound and then by the time I came out ofprison, Greyhound was no more there and then the very same buseswere non-existent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Would you say the same bus company is stilloperating in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I don't know, because I've got a long timein prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Do you know anything about an intended settlementor negotiation which was led by the local ministers of religion(inaudible)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, that I recall because the one who ledthe delegation was Rev Kosongo(?)</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> And how did that happen?  Could you just explainto the committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Could you just explain to the committee howdid this happen, who was involved and why was it done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> The person I remember who was there was MrKosongo and I can't remember the others, but their intention wasto go there because there were people who could (inaudible) otherpeople as religious people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> How many ministers of religion, if you canrecall, all in all were there?  Just an estimate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Estimation is plus five or six.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> And where did they attempt to enter into negotiations? Where was the venue and who was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> They used to go to the Presbyterian Churchwhere Mr Kosongo was the reverend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> And were the members of the 3 million alsopresent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> They came once and the youth lost control. Senator Bloem managed to let them escape because the youth wasnow out of control.  And the intention of the meeting was actuallyto bring peace back.  Because the community at that time was soangry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> In trying to resolve this amicably, did youmake any attempts to contact the ANC head office to come to yourassistance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, we did make attempts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> When was this done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I cannot remember the days specifically, butI remember that it was between October month and December wherebywe indicated to them.  I even got information that some of the3 million members were in hiding.  It was at about two o'clockand I took them to the camps.  I took those children to SenatorBloem at about two o'clock and then he took them to Shell House.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> What children are we talking about now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> These were the members of the 3 million.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You refer to them as children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No, not (inaudible) children.  I am referringthis to - I once caught two young children who were the membersof the gang and then the other members of the SDUs tried to killthem but I deny them and then took the children to Mr Bloem'sresidence and then he took them to Shell House.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> How old were these two children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Between 16 and 18 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And what did the other people want to doto them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> They wanted to kill them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Was that the members of your self-defenceunion?  Or who wanted to kill them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> The members of Premier.  They were sittingin one place to defend their area there.  So I caught those childrennear their camp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Who wanted to kill them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> The workers of Premier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> The workers of Premier Milling wanted tokill two children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Thulu, are you still referring to theincident which happened October and December?]</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did you personally accompany these childrento Shell House in Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> So you won't know who assisted them in ShellHouse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No, I don't know.  What I knew is that theywent with Comrade Dennis Bloem to Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Dennis Bloem took them to Shell House.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now you testified about the men or employeesof Premier Milling Company.  How did they get involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> These are the people who resisted everything</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a>that was done by the 3 million gang, more than the community ofMaokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> The death of Masusu(?) caused by yourself,did you thereby achieve anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> What?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Peace and stability.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Are you telling the committee that becauseof this one man, Masusu, there couldn't be peace and stability?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> In what way was he stopping it alone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> As I have already said yesterday, he was alsothe spinal cord of 3 million.  When you are a leader of an organisationthat is troubling the community, as soon as you fall down we assumethat the pillar has been destroyed and the members of his gangwould not attack back as they used to attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> But the leader was George Ramasimong and notMasusu, that was the pillar of the 3 million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> He was also the leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You testified yesterday about your connectionwith Masusu and the fact that he was your idol for what he didin soccer, you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Now that gives me the impression you were ingood terms, you can talk to him, as you once referred to him as"Groot man", not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Don't you think it would have been advisableor even better instead of shooting him, as you did, to talk tohim as your "Groot man" and try to reason things outwith him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I tried, as I said.  Whenever I talked toDuvidi he was near Duvidi.  They were close friend and they werealways together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yes, but did you ever take any attempts -look, I don't think he was sleeping with George Ramasimong.  Atall times you would go to his place.  Did you take such pains?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> What I can tell you, he was a person who usedto terrorise the community and they used to stay together in oneplace.  You'd never see him alone.  They'd be together at alltimes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> When you shot him, that is Masusu, as you did,was he in any way armed with a weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, he was armed, he had a knife, a self-madeknife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> And yourself and other members of SDUs usedthe guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Do you find it having been necessary to useguns on him when he only had a knife?  Couldn't he be disarmed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I beg yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Couldn't he have been disarmed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No, there was no other way to disarm him. (inaudible) you cannot disarm someone, you just have to defendyourself so that you mustn't lose your life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Do you say you were acting in self-defence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> But if Mr Thulu, if I remember well, you testified that you shot him on the back first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Which tells me that he was facing anotherdirection other than yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Where were you defending yourself there, becausehe was not even facing you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I want to explain how I defended myself. I have already told the committee that our intention was not togo and search for him, but we had to do what I did because wewere now in their base.  You get so nervous and you think thathe is not the only person there.  Even the people who are runningaway, you get so disturbed that you think they are attacking youand then you'd attack back so that you get out of that place safe.  (APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> At that time when you were attacking him asyou did, did you have it in mind that you were acting on behalfof the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, because I was defending the people whowere the members of the ANC and my community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Mr Thulu, the Act in terms of which youhave made an application for amnesty, says that a person may begranted amnesty provided certain requirements are met.  And itis this requirement which your application must meet.  One ofthe requirements is that the Act, or in your case, the offencein respect of which you have been convicted must be associatedwith a political objective.  Do you understand what I am saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Now what is the political objective whichyou were seeking to achieve when you killed this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> The objective for the reason that made meis that these people of the 3 million were terminating(?) AfricanNational Congress, and I was aware that because of our organisationbeing unbanned ....</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Just start all over again.   We couldn'thear your answer.  You were answering my question to tell us whatpolitical objective was being served by or was being achievedby killing this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> The political objective that I achieved, thatI achieved, was the voice - I saw that the people have voted forthe ANC during the elections, and that was the objective thatwe got.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> No, I mean at the time when you killedhim, what political objective were you trying to pursue, at thetime when you killed him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> It was to protect the community and the membersof the ANC and I managed to get that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> I don't understand.  In which way exactly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I want to broaden this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Just tell me what the political objective- the exact political objective that you were trying to achieve? The whole purpose of us assembling here is, I must tell you,is to try and find out what political purpose the killing of thisperson was going to serve.  It will not help your applicationmerely to say that this man was a rapist, he killed 102 peopleand the like.  The law does not say that if somebody kills 100people you must kill him.  That is not what the law says.  Inyour case, for your application to succeed, you must tell us whatthe political objective, exactly what political objective wereyou trying to promote in killing him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> My political objective was to see to it thatmy organisation is not being terminated by the gangster, thatis being perpetrated by the former government which is NationalParty and its forces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Your political organisation being?</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Was this man a threat to the continuedexistence of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> In which way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> We used to have mass campaigns.  We used toprotest against the law, we used to protest against the council,making peaceful rainbow cause and whatsoever, and these peoplewho had been used to threaten the community so that the communitycan come and pay their rent forcibly and the Mayor, Osmond Sikwekwe(?)at the time and then he was told that if they don't pay they wouldbe evicted.  (APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Please don't, like we asked you yesterday,please don't do that because you are not really helping his case. When we decide whether or not to give this amnesty, we are notgoing to count how many times you clapped hands for him.  Please,give him the chance to explain his case properly so that he canget the chance to apply for his amnesty properly.  We are notgoing to be influenced by whether or not you clapped hands.  Youare just really spoiling his case, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a> Now Mr Thulu, I am going to take you step by step and you mustlisten very carefully and answer the question as it comes.  Ifyou don't understand it you must tell me.  Was there any occasionduring which these - or first let me say.  Who are these peoplethat the Mayor said or the councillor said he would send to forcepeople to come and pay rent?  Is it the 3 million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Is there any occasion when in fact theydid threaten people to go and force them into doing anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, it was just rumoured but after he hasconveyed the message we made it a point that they don't threatenthe people as he mentioned because we wanted the community tobe what we want it to be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> You have said that on occasions you heldsome protest marches.  That is, I assume it to be members of theANC, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Was there any occasion during which membersof the 3 million gang interfered with your protest marches, inthe form of trying to disrupt them or to make them fail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Tell me more about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> During that time when everything was happening,there was a march organised to the councillors' offices.  Thecommunity of Maokeng was complaining about the arrears, that theydo not even know about the high payments of the electricity, asif they were operating factories. As we were organising the peopleat the shopping centres, members of the 3 million gang came. They attacked the people, the people dispersed.  We had to organisethe people back to the</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a>shopping centre. </p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Any other occasion that you can remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> That is the only one I remember, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Is there any other way in which membersof the 3 million gang interfered with the affairs of the ANC orany political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> In which way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> There was a time when a consumer boycott wasconducted, and we have been preaching to the people the importanceof consumer boycott.  Those who had businesses, we wanted themto gain.  We tried to talk to the councillors to tell them thatthe monies that we have to pay are so heavy - we made door-to-doorcampaign.  And those people, the members, got into the streetsand our members were threatened, they couldn't continue with thedoor-to-door campaign.  They were told to stop their message.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Did that kind of conduct on the part ofthe 3 million gang have a negative effect on the campaign forthis consumer boycott?</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, because the community of Maokeng wasso threatened.  If you went into a house as a family you knowto explain to them what was happening, they will say to you itdoesn't help for you to come and tell us.  We know that we haveto be part of this, but tomorrow when we come back 3 million gangis going to kill us saying that we have been involved in the marchtogether with the members of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> I don't know if you would be able to havean answer to this question, but in so interfering with the activitiesof the organisation, what did the 3 million gang actually standto gain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> They wanted to terminate ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Did you think there would be any benefitto them by having the ANC terminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> What benefit do you think would be there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> The Council would carry on letting the peoplepay very high rates on top of the threats that the community hadalready received.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> When you speak of the Council, are youreferring to the Maokeng Town Council?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Maokeng Town Councils, the former one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> It is fairly known throughout the countrythat there was a time when there were Town Councils and Mayorswhich were rejected by the majority of the black people throughoutthe country.  Is the Council that you are referring to that kindof Council?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Where did the revenue for the Council comefrom?  Do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Can you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> For the Council to run properly, I am sureit needed to have money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> What were the sources, where did the Councilget its monies from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I think it was one of the Nationalist Partytools, they used to get money from the Nationalist Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Did the Council also collect money fromthe residents or want to collect money from the residents in theform of the tariffs, such as for electricity and water etc. etc?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Were there any boycotts aimed against paymentof those things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Is this one of the boycotts that you saythe 3 million gang interfered with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Yesterday you testified about a possiblerelationship between, or collusion between the police and possiblythe prosecutors or prosecutor.  Now did you see any visible relationshipor any evidence of working together between the 3 million gangand the Town Council?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> How did they work together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> The then Council and the 3 million gang collaboratedbecause on many occasions we would see that the Mayor's transportwould be used by the 3 million gang members to attack the communityof Maokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> You have said two things in that sentence,and I want you to treat them separately.  Firstly you have saidthat members of the 3 million gang used to be transported by thekombis which belonged to the then Mayor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, that is what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> And then you said they would attack peopleor something to that effect with the kombis.  Let's leave thatfor a while.  On how many occasions did you see members of the3 million gang being transported in the vehicles of the Mayor? Whether they were going for shopping or for a picnic or to goas you say to go and kill people it doesn't matter.  I just wantto know how many times did you see them being transported in thevehicles of the Mayor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> This used to happen almost everyday becausethese were the people.  The kombis would take them to town andgo to town to take them back.  If they were supposed to appearbefore the court, they would be taken by those kombis and thenbe taken back in the same kombis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Were these kombis operating as taxis inwhich any person could get into them, or would these kombis transportonly members of the 3 million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> At first they were the public transport, butafter the community had a campaign against him he deemed it fitto use them for the 3 million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> So at some stage the people of Maokengrefrained from using the kombis of the Mayor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> They were initially used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Now after the people decided not to usehis taxis he then used it for the purpose of transporting the3 million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Were these taxis that belonged to himin his private capacity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> How many kombis are we talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> There would be about five or six.  He hada lot of kombis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> What do you mean when you say the membersof the 3 million gang also used these kombis to attack membersof the public or the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I mean they were like an armoured vehiclewhen they wanted to fight, because everywhere they wanted to goand fight they would be sitting in that transport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Did you see any such occasion where theyused these kombis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Many a times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Just give me the name of the Mayor at thetime?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Mr Caswell Qweqwe(?).</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> What do you mean by saying that on occasionsas the members of the 3 million gang drove into town with thekombis the police followed them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> They used to accompany them so that they aresafe, so as to take their mission forward as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> What are these objectives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> To terrorise the community of Maokeng andto see to it that the ANC is terminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Can you give us an idea more or less ofthe number of members of the 3 million gang?</p>

<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Would they fill all the five to six kombisanyway?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, plus those who were fearing their lives. I mean 30 people can make two kombis and then the others</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>were those maybe who lived nearer to (inaudible) and returningas if they are because of their life. </p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Were there people who were forced to jointhe 3 million gang or to be supporters of the 3 million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I hope so.  Because ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> You think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> It is so, because they used to do it, to forcepeople to join it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> And can you tell us more or less of thestrength, the strength of the self-defence unit?</p>

Their aim was to defend themselvesagainst the 3 million gang.  I would go to different places asa coordinator to see to it that they function perfectly well. They would be doing the same thing that we were doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Are you saying there were several cells?</p>

<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> It just happened like that;  I never organisedit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Why did you take a gun when you were outon bail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> For the sake of my community's lives and myorganisation to defend them.</p>

<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> On countless occasion, I couldn't rememberwell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And you took a gun as soon as you werereleased on bail to protect your community.  Is that what youwant us to believe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Did the police ask you where you got the gunfrom?</p>

<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> These kombis that were used by the 3 milliongang, were they also used by other members of the public, of thecommunity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No, the public boycotted the taxis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So they were taxis that's been boycottedby the community out of their own free will.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> The community decided to boycott the taxisout of their own free will.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And you've already told us that the policeprotected the taxis when they carried members of the 3 milliongang because the community may attack them, is that correct? You also once used a kombi to go to  Trombe, is it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was that also a taxi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> To whom did that taxi belong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Mr (inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So it was another owner of taxis, competingtaxi rank.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was there a taxi war sort of in thosedays too or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Ja, it was operating taxi by that time.  Itwas operating to transport the public.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But I think you don't follow my question. Was there a sort of taxi war between two taxi groups or didn'tthe taxi people have a war at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You said they were transported by the kombiswhen they had to appear in court, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Were some of the members of the 3 milliongang arrested and did they have to appear in court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And what happened to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> They just got released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Do you know of people giving evidence againsthim in those cases?</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Would the people be afraid to give evidenceagainst them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> That's true, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did the police enquire and try to get evidenceagainst them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> What you know of, or did they in factnot even try to get evidence against them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> They didn't even try.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But they have arrested them, so they musthave grounds to believe they have done something wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> The reason to arrest them, they wouldn't arrestthem.  They wanted the community to leave them alone.  They wouldtake them and put them in gaol.  It was just something that wasbeing played to take them from the community.  They arrested themfor safety sake from the community and the community's anger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But you said they appeared in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, even the very same court conspired withthe 3 million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did the 3 million gang recruit members fromall over the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, they recruited members all over the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did they even recruit members who belongedto the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did those members remain members of theANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, I still remember two of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Are they still members of the ANC now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> They are not alive any more.</p>

<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> One of them was killed by the community atSashoville(?) he was stoned to death.   And the other one waskilled by the SDU members during a war or during a fight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> How many members of the 3 million ganghave been killed over the years by the SDUs or the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I don't have any specific number, but it isbetween 20 and 25.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was that the original founder members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> And the others who crossed from ANC and joinedthe gangster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Thulu, will you tell us how many peoplestayed Maokeng Township?  Are you able to approximate the numberof people?</p>

<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Will you say you have about 50 000 people,you have about 5 000 residents in Maokeng Township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I remember the statistics were up to 130 000residents of Maokeng.  It was in 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Do you have other political parties formingpart of the community of Maokeng Township?  Would you have theANC, the IFP and the PAC and such other parties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> AZAPO was there and the PAC was there, butwhen I left the IFP was not here.  I don't know presently is itthere or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And are you able to tell us what the concentrationlevel within the 3 million gang was?  How many percentages youhad of the AZAPO membership with forming part of the 3 milliongang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Some of them joined the 3 million gang andI met their leaders.  I still remember when I met their leaders. They were with Duvidi in the court of law and they were alreadystaying at Trombo(?), which was a very strong (inaudible).  Icalled the two of them aside. I said to them, Look, this is irrelevant,we are fighting for one thing.  I am requesting you, be awarethat the Nationalist Party is using the 3 million gang.  I don'twant to land up in a situation where we would be fighting againstyou.  They asked me, what do you want us to do?  I said the communityknows that you are now part of the 3 million gang.  I will goback to the community and tell them what to do and then you haveto go back to your different homes until I resolve this issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Let me ask you a very direct question,Mr Tulu.  Was the 3 million gang threatening the whole communityof Maokeng, which consisted of other different political parties,or did it direct its attacks predominantly on the ANC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Directly on the ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Are you able to give us examples on whichyou drew this conclusion that their attacks were directed onlyto ANC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Will you please do that, Mr Tulu, whichwill assist us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> It happened that I was together with the membersof the SDUs.  I was with (inaudible) from Kentucky and we wantedto cross the street.  Bloem had been to the</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a>doctor.  Someone insulted him with his mother.  We met with theother comrades and the SDUs were so disturbed and they wantedto attack and then (inaudible) and he said we know who are thepuppets, we don't have to worry.  And it happened to me when theykilled Comrade Ngesile very close to the (inaudible).  When theyleft they went direct to my home.  The previous day I was goingto the doctor for ulcer treatments but they were aware that Iwas sick.  Fortunately enough I was together with some membersof the SDU and they drove them back when they tried to kill me. And when we approached the corner we saw a police van.  And thenwe could see that they were driven to this place by the police. And I was a member of the ANC and I was the leader of the SDUs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> What was the intention behind the formationin Maokeng Township of the SDUs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> To defend the community and African NationalCongress, the termination of African National Congress against3 million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> That was the main intention behind theformation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Of SDUs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And when was the SDU formed?  You are theCommander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> When was it formed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Before the end of the month November.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Which year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> In 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> When did the 3 million gang come intoexistence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I still recall very well.  It started existingbetween June month and July month.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Which year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> The very same year, 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Yesterday there was evidence led by MrPetros that when the 3 million gang started, it started as a criminalgang involved in ordinary criminal activity, but it later tookon a political character.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, you see that's how they used to (inaudible). He wanted us to avoid the fact that the government was part ofwhat they were doing.  What I can tell you is, Roland Petros isa member of the SDU under our command, the other commanders ofthe SDU.  He doesn't have that kind of information.  We have alot of information and they were just doing the defence for thecommunity through our (inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I am unable to get your response to myquestion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> What I am trying to say is,  when he saidthey were a criminal group, it was a tactic from the police as</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a>well as the Council so that this was not a group to attack thepeople.  The Council and the police were behind them actuallybecause as leaders we used to hold meetings with the Council regardingthe rent issues and we were then told that these people are notpaying.  My organisation will come and evict them.  Now we knewthat what they were doing to the community, it wasn't the truth. It wasn't the right thing;  they were just disguising. </p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Thulu, are you in summary saying thatwhen the 3 million gang came into existence they took on a politicalcharacter and they were not initially involved in criminal activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> That's what I am saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Let's go back to the death of Mr Masusu. When was the decision taken to kill Mr Masusu by your organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Actually we never took the decision of killingMasuso.  What we did, we said that we will defend the communityagainst Masuso.  Irrespective of what kind of defence are we goingto take, but we will just defend the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> When was that decision made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> When I started forming the SDUs as a Commander,that was the day when we decided as a general Commander.  Duringthis time there was no formal Commander to say stand here anddo this.  But even those who joined the SDUs later they have nevercome to me, they will do exactly what they found other membersof the SDU were doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Masusu was killed in 1991 and you hadalready taken this decision in about November 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> That is the act to protect the community againstthe harassment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Was there any reason why that order wasnot acted upon immediately, why you had to wait until the 11thFebruary 1991 to put that order into effect,  or that decision,to implement that decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> We were not in a hurry to kill him and itwas not our intention to kill him.  We were just defending thecommunity against him.  Even to go there, it wasn't our plan tokill him, but it just happened that at the time we had to defendourselves.  That's how he died.  If we were in any hurry to killhim we could have stood up at that time and go straight to himand kill him, but it wasn't our intention.  We wanted to defendthe community, but the situation led to his death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Do I understand your evidence correctlywhen you stated just now that you actually went to Trombo(?) whichis the stronghold of the 3 million gang and you found yourselfsuddenly in the company of the 3 million gang and you had to shootyour way out to defend yourselves.  Now why did you go to Trombo,knowing that it is the stronghold of the 3 million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Usually during the day some of them used togo to town and we thought that by going to Trombo - because thepolice were (inaudible) of the ANC (inaudible).  We thought thatby going to Trombo those left behind would run away and the policewould never have in their minds to go to Trombo to search forus and they would never think that we'd be at Trombo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Notwithstanding the fact that it was thestronghold of the 3 million gang who were being assisted by thepolice at all material times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> We realised at that time that it was the lastalternative to go to (inaudible).  Because to remain in that areawhere the police were occupying some of us wouldn't be livingtoday.  Now we went there and the incident took place and thepolice left our stronghold and they came to this area and we managedto go back to our area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> How many kombis did you take Mr Tulu withyou to Trombo?  Did you use, one, two kombis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> One.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And how many people were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> It was full.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> How many people were inside the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Fifteen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Are you able to enlighten us why Mr Masusuwas the one who you killed instead of Mr Duvidi if you wantedto weaken the 3 million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I have never wanted for an individual, Duvidior Masusu, I was actually defending the people that were at Trombo. Before I could meet Duvidi I met Masusu and I had to (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You were defending the people at Trombo. Is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> The aim of going to Trombo was not to go anddefend the people of Trombo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> We will take the short adjournment at this stageand resume in 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> There are two points I would like to clearup with you.  These two AZAPO people you told us about, you rememberyou told us two AZAPO people who joined the 3 million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.  Masheme Shisani(?) and Patrick (inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Do you know where they are now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No, I don't know where they are now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> The second point I would like you to tellme is why were the police looking for you on this morning, themorning when you killed this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Because they heard that I am the one who killedthe deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> No, before you killed the deceased, whywere they looking for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I gave impact to - the reason for them tolook for me, I was the leader of the SDUs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Yes, but you had been the leader of itfor months hadn't you?  Why did they suddenly come looking foryou this morning, on this particular morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Which morning are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> The morning on which you killed this man,the 11th February.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> They knew I was the leader of the SDUs sothat made them suspicion that I was some sort of a disturber tothis organisation which is the 3 million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> For how long had you been the leader ofthe SDUs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> From their origin, from the day when theywere started.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So why were they looking for you</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a>on this morning of the 11th February?  Was there any reason whythe police should come looking for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> The reason for them to look for me, I wasthe leader of the SDUs and these units were disturbing the 3 milliongang to carry forward their aims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Tulu, were the SDU members constantlyharassed by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And these harassment took also the form ofthem being constantly being investigated by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Could you repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> The harassment that the police had on theSDU members, did it also take the form of you being constantlybeing under surveillance by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Were you scared to sleep at your home? Yesterday you gave evidence that you actually spent most of yourtime at your girlfriend's place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, that's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Why were you scared to sleep at your home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Because the 3 million gang would attack meand the police would be able to arrest me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Were you more scared of the 3 million gangthan you were scared of being harassed by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> From both sides it was the same thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> So you actually saw both parties, that isthe police and the 3 million gang, as actually acting againstanything that the SDU members stood for and the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR TULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did the police know who your girlfriendwas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And they knew you were staying with her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But they knew you visited her, she is yourgirlfriend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Mr Thulu, I just wanted to clear something. You made reference to a state prosecutor yesterday.  Preciselywhat did you say was his or her role with regard to the 3 milliongang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> She was the person who would protect themfrom going to gaol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Sorry.  Can you just repeat your answer? I had asked you what the exact role was of the prosecutor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> She made it a point that their cases wouldbe handled by her and then she would make it a point that theydon't go to gaol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Is that all you can say about her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> That's all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Because yesterday somebody told us thatat some stage she accommodated members of the 3 million gang intown.  Do you know anything about that or you don't?</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I know it from rumours, but I don't have anyevidence regarding that case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> We are talking about in the past whenpeople used to be seen in terms of being black and white in thiscountry.  That was the position during that time, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Members of the 3 million gang, were theyblack people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> We were told that they killed a numberof people, these members of the 3 million gang, a figure of about102 was mentioned to us.  Is that the figure that you were alsogiven?</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Were these victims black?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Were arrests made in respect of some ofthese murders or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Arrests were made, people were arrested, butit wasn't of any use because they were released, they were neversent to gaol to show that they've done a very bad thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Were there any - or let me put it to youthis way.  A witness told us yesterday that members of the communityhere complained about lack of activity by the police, they wrotea letter to a Minister and only thereafter a certain captain wassent here.  Do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Such arrests as were made, were they madebefore that captain came here or after?</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> The arrests were made before he was brought</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a>here.  They were arrested and they were never sentenced.  Theycame back to the township. </p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> You say the arrests were made.  Sorry,were they made after or before, I am sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> The police arrested them before and then theybrought them back to the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> And after his arrival were any arrestsmade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Were the people not brought back to thecommunity there at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No.  They came after a long time and thenthose who were involved in the murder cases were sentenced andthey stayed in gaol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> That was only after the captain arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> To your knowledge, did members of the 3million gang kill any white person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I don't have any knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> You are a resident of Maokeng, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, that's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> And Kroonstad is not very far from Maokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, it is not far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Do you know of during that time any whitepeople who were killed by criminals around Kroonstad, not theirnames, but just the incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> You know of an incident, don't you duringwhich certain white people were killed in Maokeng by a group ofyoung people, don't you know about that?  Or were you alreadyin gaol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I was already in gaol when one of the whitemen - we never regarded him as a white person.  He was stayingwith us here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> He was called Thabo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Oh, you refer to an incident  in which onewhite man was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> That's the one I am referring to, but whenyou asked me at first it must have slipped my mind because wenever regarded his colour, or we didn't see him as a white person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> That is why I said to you that we are goingback to history when we used to see colours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Ekskuus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> That is why when I asked you about thecolour of the people, I told you that we are going back to historywhen we used to see colours.  I actually wanted you to see colours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> It is true that was used, but in our organisationwe never regarded colour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Was an arrest made in connection with thatparticular murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Soon after the murder or did it take a longtime to have an arrest made in respect of that particular murder?</p>

Are you able to give us an example, the name of one or two ANCleaders, or you regarded as ANC leaders who were amongst the peoplekilled by the 3 million gang?</p>

<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> When were they killed?  Could you name,say a period, between months or which year round about?  Not theexact dates, but round about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> After we've started the SDUs and even if Iwas still in gaol they have been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Sorry, could you perhaps tell me whenthe first one was killed, the first killing took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I can't remember, so many things happened. I can't remember the date when they were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Were there any of them killed before Duvidiand Masusu was killed?</p>

<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But you yourself was arrested in connectionwith one of those killings, wasn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Of the killings of the 3 million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.   But those who killed the people, noone was arrested by that time.</p>

<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Are there any questions you would like to putto this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Tulu, I wouldlike you to answer my questions in Sotho.  I think it would gomuch quicker and for the purposes of us to get quickly over this,I would like you just to answer the specific question that I amasking.  Don't give me a long story.  Let us start with the lastquestion concerning what Adv de Jager asked you here, the killingsof 3 million people.  Besides these killings, were you the onethat you were involved in, do you remember a killing of an individualin the community called Alfie(?)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> How did that killing occur?</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I was in prison by that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You don't know about it.  Okay, I will leaveit at that.  Would you say that the killings that took place of3 million gang members, other than the one that you were involvedin, were premeditated and planned and then executed, or will yousay that those killings took place spontaneously from actionsof a crowd that had gathered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I don't think you answered the question. It is a two-legged question.  I want to find out, do you thinkthat there was a planned execution of a 3 million gang member? I am not talking about the killing of George Ramasimong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> What are you actually telling us?  Thatthey were not planned, but they happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, they happened, because it was duringthe time we defended the community (speaking indistinctly)</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Just to remind you again.  I think it wouldbe better if you respond to my questions in Sosotho.  Just keepon remembering that.  You mentioned that you know of a personcalled Mdowisile Mbelwane.  Besides Mbelwane, do you know of any,not leaders of the ANC, but members of the ANC who were killedby the 3 million gang, members?  Do you know of any?</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Can you remember the names of anyone, ofmembers of the ANC (inaudible) that were killed by the 3 milliongang, besides Mdowisile Mbelwane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Sisi Sifatsa(?).</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Anyone else that you can remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> That's the person I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You were asked by Judge Mgoepe with regardto</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a>arrests made of 3 million gang members.  I want to find out fromyou do you know whether there are any 3 million gang members whoare serving sentences resulting from a killing or some act, unlawfulact arising during that reign of terror as you described?</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> How many are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Where are they serving their sentences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Here in Kroonstad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Do you know whether they have applied forindemnity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No, they did not apply.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> How do you know they have not applied forindemnity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I tried to speak to them on several occasionsbecause we decided that we have to all apply for amnesty.  Theysaid no, they are scared, they will not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> When the captain that Adv Mpshe was referringto, when he was asking questions about arrests which were made,he is referring to Captain Derie(?), do you know about his comingto Kroonstad?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Now when he made arrests of certain 3 milliongang members, where were you then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> In prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> And these people who were arrested, the3 million gang members, where were they taken to, to which prisonto await trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> The very same prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Did you interact with them, were you stayingin the same cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No, we stayed in different sections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You never were able to speak with them andtalk about reconciliation or any other thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> There was such a time because our sectionswere very close, only a fence was in between.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> If my memory serves me well, I could be wrongabout this, but you will have to help us.  There was a memberof the 3 million gang who was killed in gaol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Who is he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Madsile Ramasimong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> How is he related to George Duvidi Ramasimong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> He is the last born of the Ramasimong family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Were you in gaol when he was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You don't know how he was killed, or whathave you learned about how he was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No, I just hear because he was awaiting trialand I was already serving my sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Can you tell us about the arrests that CaptainDerie made, whether you know of any conviction that came as aresult of such arrests?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> The two that I've already mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> According to your knowledge, was the communityfree to make - did the community feel, or did the community comeregularly forward to make statements to the police regarding whatthey know about the activities of the 3 million gang, or werethey intimidated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> They were fearful, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You were also asked concerning the timewhen you were sleeping at your girlfriend's home hiding from thepolice and/or the 3 million gang.  In relation to that I am puttingthe following question to you.  Have you in your own personalcapacity, have you ever personally been exposed to an attack bythe 3 million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Can you explain when?  Don't give us a longstory please.  Just give us more or less when it happened andshortly what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I was at home when Comrade Mdomisile was killed. I realised when my younger sister came from outside she threwthe dish on the floor and when I peeped through the window I sawthe that the 3 million gang members were surrounding my house. We were lucky enough to be ...(intervention).  Actually I confrontedthem ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You escaped, you were not killed.  Were youinjured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Any other incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> In town when we were facing the bus rank,we wanted to catch a taxi and we thought it was a taxi belongingto ordinary members of the community, but when we got nearer themembers of the 3 million gang chased us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> They chased you and you ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, we ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Remember you were asked the question of- you kept on saying repeatedly "we were defending ourselves,we were defending the community", remember that line of questioning? Now I want you to respond to the following.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a>The incident when you killed Masusu, when Masusu was facing inthe opposite direction, you say he missed stabbing you, he wasalso intoxicated and then you shot him from the back.  At thetime when you shot him in the back, he was not a danger to you. You will agree, because he was facing the other direction.  Imean to you personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> He was still dangerous, because if he couldhave got a chance to come back he would continue doing what hewanted to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> No, I am just talking about the moment,that moment.  When somebody is facing in another direction andyou are having a firearm and you shoot him in the back, at thatmoment, split moment, he was not a danger to you, you will agreeto that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I don't agree with you, Sir.  That doesn'tmean he wasn't a danger to me.  The situation at that time wantedme to do what I did to see that I was protected</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Yes, you have already said that, I agree,you said that.  What I am trying to say is that when he rushedyou with a knife and he missed you, he failed to stab you.  Butwhen you shot him in the back you exceeded the bounds of self-defence. That is why you are saying to this Commission you are wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> He is not saying that to this Commission. That is what you want him to say.  He is saying to this Commissionthat he was acting in self-defence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I concede that, Mr Chairman.  When he missedyou with the knife, he passed and then thereafter you shot him. So at the time when you shot him, he was not about to stab you,at the moment when the bullet entered his body, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> It is true, he was facing the other direction. Can I be given a chance to explain this that I want to emphasise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Yes, okay, but don't be long please.  Becauseyou see, I am concentrating on the moment when the shots werefired, not other moments.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Sorry Mr Thulu, why did you shot Masuso,why did you shoot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I was scared, because when he came back hewould kill me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> The 3 million gang, do you know whetherthey had any relationship with the IFP, the political party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.   I know they had a relationship withthe IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> How do you know this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> They used to raise their flag when they wereburying their members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You were also asked whether there are anypolitical organisations operative in Kroonstad then.  You mentionedAzapo and the PAC.  I'd like to find out whether you know whatpolitical affiliation Masuso was besides being a member of the3 million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I don't know whether he belonged to any politicalorganisation, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I didn't hear that response, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I didn't know Masusu as any member of anypolitical organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You were also asked about the force or coercionthat was exercised on certain individuals to join the 3 milliongang, you remember that?  Do you know of a person called Tsolo(?),a young man who was a member of the</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a>3 million gang and who defected?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> He said he was intimidated.  They said theywould kill him if he doesn't join.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You also mentioned that the police usedto follow the 3 million gang around.  I want to find out fromyou, as far as you know, do you know that the police could dosomething to stop the 3 million gang from either, I mean stopthe 3 million gang when they see them committing crime?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You indicated in answering questions fromJudge Mgoepe that you could not continue to do door-to-door asa result of the intimidation from or the activities of the 3 milliongang, am I correct?  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You were also asked when you formed thesedefence units, as a result of which ultimately - of the operationsof which you ultimately killed Masuso, did you what you wantedto bring about.  Do you remember that question?  What did youwant to bring about with involving yourself in these activities? Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, I remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> My question to you is, during that periodwould you say that there was free political activity in the neighbourhoodof Maokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Now what was your intention in committing</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a>yourself to the defence units and ultimately finding yourselfhaving to kill Masuso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Peace, stability and freedom of politicalactivity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Would you say that the community was intimidatedfrom participating freely in politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Do you remember or do you know of incidentswhere the 3 million gang hijacked transport from ordinary membersof the public, especially taxi owners?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> How frequently was this done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR TULU:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> How frequently, how often?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> This happened many a time, Sir, I can't evencount.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Advocate Mpshe also asked you about negotiationsthat you would have undertaken to bring about peace.  Immediatelyafter the incident that you spoke about when the conflict startedwith George Ramasimong arising out of the allegations relatingto one George Daniel, you remember that part of his cross-examinationby Advocate Mpshe.  I am bringing you back to that.  That incident,I'd like you to give the Commission a little bit more informationregarding what happened on that occasion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a>If you don't understand to what I am referring to you must askme.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Can you please explain, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Yes, you can continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> He wants you to explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> If you can just raise your voice.  I am sorry,I didn't hear that.  I am referring you to an incident</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a>which took place, if you remember you were asked what you didto try and negotiate and bring about peace.  Do you know of anincident that took place after George Ramasimong now moved frombeing a member of the African National Congress Youth League andimmediately started these 3 million activities.  Initiatives whichwere taken by the Youth League, I think Rev Gosongo(?), SenatorDennis Bloem, to bring about or to stop the conflict that wasbeginning to set in.   Do you know about this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Can you tell the Commission what happenedat that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> It was decided that we had to meet the 3</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a>million gang to sit down and negotiate and solve this.  It istrue they were called to Mr Gosongo's church together with otherministers. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Before you go on, were you there personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.  They were all called and we sat at MrGosongo's church and we tried to look into matters as how to solveissues.  The thing that was emphasised there is the one I referredto yesterday that we didn't want the situation to reach the pointit reached.  If Duvidi felt that his girlfriend was being interferedwith, we would solve that, but they ended up saying we realisethat you, the ANC, you are with George, Dennis George was attackedthereafter by the 3 million gang together with his family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Thus nothing turned out of those peace initiatives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MATSEPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Mr Matsepe, before you put questions tothis witness, I just want to find out something from this witness. There is one vital point on which initially I thought I understoodyou, but after a few questions by your attorney, it seems to methat I understand you far less than I thought I did, and thisis important.  You killed the deceased because you say you wereafraid the deceased might kill you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> And that is the only reason why you killedthe deceased.  Is that the only reason why you killed the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> The other reason was that he was a personwhom (inaudible) because ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Just answer in Southern Sotho please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> That is not the only reason.  The other reasonwas that he'd been the person initially to protect the communityagainst.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> But you didn't say that when your attorneyasked you, or in fact when I intervened and asked you as to whyyou killed this person, you only said that you were afraid hewould kill you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> And then I further explained to say that thesituation at that present moment, that people were running upand down and you couldn't understand who would come to you tohurt you, so you were supposed to defend yourself.  That is oneof the reasons that we decided to shoot at him because we didn'tknow, except him, who else was on the scene to attack us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> You didn't kill him because of the factthat he was frustrating the political activities of the</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a>ANC, did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I want to explain this clearly.  It is true,he was doing that, he was frustrating the activities, but nowI am being asked two different questions here.  The first oneis at the place, what made me kill him.  When you come back youask me didn't I kill him because he was hurting the community. That was the reason that made us form SDUs against him becausehe was harassing the community, but at the time when we were therehe was killed because of the situation that was reigning there. We had to defend ourselves to escape the area alive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> So you killed him for a reason other thanthe (inaudible) reason to defend yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Both.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Then please say so.  Please say so wheneveryou are asked, don't give one.  Give both.  Sorry, what do youmean by both?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I killed him because my life was in dangerat that time and the second point, I wanted to defend the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> As I understand you, the reason that youwanted to defend the community was a basic reason that existedfor a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But on this occasion the specific reasonwhy you killed him was you were afraid he might turn on you andkill you or that others might kill you.  You were acting in self-defence,of yourself and the other people who were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> At that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> At that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, but generally it was to defend the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Yes, but at that time you killed him - youwere thinking only of defending yourself, is that so?  That'swhat you've said time and again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> And the others who were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Sorry, I interrupted you, I apologise. You can go ahead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> One of the Committee members asked you aquestion regarding Mrs Pienaar.  Which part did she take?  Andwhen you answered you said she should take care that the membersof the 3 million gang do not go to gaol.  Do you still rememberthat?  Now the question is, how did she manage to do this, becausethe magistrate was the only person to take a decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> That wasn't a hidden fact, because most ofthe time the courts around here, before the magistrate would sentencehe would ask the prosecutors, how do you view this case, and mostof the time it would appear that the decision that would be takenwould be taken because of the feelings of the prosecutor who wasthen Mrs Pienaar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> The cases for the 3 million gang people,were they handled by one magistrate or different magistrates?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> They went to one magistrate most of the timeand the same prosecutor and it happened that if the magistratewas in the other case he would be called into this case of the3 million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> In other words, you are telling this Committeethat their cases were handled by one prosecutor, by one magistrate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> That is what I will briefly say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE::</span> Do you know the name of the magistrate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> I remember the name Basson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> How many cases do you know of that were takenby this magistrate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Many of them, countless, I can't even count.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Are you talking about the cases relating tothe gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR THULU:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Mr Chairman, I have no further questionsto this witness.  I wish to proceed with the next applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I call the next applicant.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I want to explainthe case to you before I proceed with my questions, so that wecan understand where we stand now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a> You were accused of a murder of the deceased and you were foundguilty.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Which deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> The deceased was Tsietsie Leboko.  And youwere convicted of his murder.  Let me start by saying, do youagree that you perpetrated his murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Do you realise that now you are not beingtried;  you have just come here to tell us about what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, I realise that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Do you understand that you have come to makea certain plea here to the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, I do understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I want us to understand each other on thisfact and I want to make sure whether you understand the reasonfor being here, so that when you answer the questions you wouldhave that in mind that you have come to us for amnesty here. Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, I do understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> What plea are you coming to make here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I have come to plea for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You have then taken an oath that you willtell the truth.  Do you know that in order to be granted amnesty,you have to tell the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> The whole truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, I do understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You don't have to hide anything from us,do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, I do understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> If there is anything that you are hidingaway, and the Committee comes to know that, or is not satisfiedabout certain facts that you disclosed to them, and become sure(?)that you are a person who tells the truth and reveal everythingto them, this Committee has the right, according to the law, notto grant you any amnesty, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, I do understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Therefore let me start by saying how oldare you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I am 24 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Sorry to interrupt, Mr Matsepe.  What yourattorneys could also have chosen to tell you is that in orderto get your amnesty you must show to this Committee that the actwhich you have committed was committed with the purpose of pursuinga political objective.  There is no point in burdening this Committeewith details which do not in any way go towards showing us thatthe offence was committed with a political objective.  It willnot help us to sit here and listen to details which don't go tothat point.  I think your attorney should also have told you that.  But I am taking that liberty to inform you so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You have already heard that if you agree thatyou performed this act and it doesn't have any political influence,your plea for amnesty will not be granted.  Therefore the Committeewants to know before we go further, how old are you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I am 24 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> When this happened, how old were you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I would like you to raise your voice so thatI can hear you because I don't have the earphones with me.  MRMPONDO:    I was 19 years old.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I was at Pumulung.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Then on the 4th May 1991 this incident happened. Can you please explain to the Committee what happened on thatday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> On the 4th May, it was on a Saturday.  Iwas together with one of my comrades at home.  When we were stillat home a girl arrived at home and she said to me there is a kombiwhich has brought about two 3 million members near the church. At that time Comrade Tsediso was still washing in the house. I thanked the girl for what she told me and I said to her I willprotect myself.  She then went away.  After a long period Tsietsiearrived together with his other friend whom I don't know.  I leftthem outside the house and I went to tell Tsediso that Tsietsieis here and he is with the other friend, I don't know.  I alsotold him about what I heard from this other girl before Tsietsiearrived.  I then went back to Tsietsie and when I got outsideTsietsie was alone and his friend was not there.  I asked himTsietsie where is your friend?  And he said he is visiting hisrelative.  I don't know where they are.  And then I went to comradeTsietsie and told him to get into the house.  I showed him toTsediso and Tsediso came to see him and then we sat down.  Andthen I left the house with Tsediso to go and talk to him.  Whilewe were still talking and telling him about what happened ComradeDaniel also arrived.  Comrade Daniel's spirit was high.  He lookedlike a person who was scared, and he said to me he saw the 3 millionkombi passing at my workplace and in the kombi I saw Tsietsie. I asked him Tsietsie and he said yes.  I then asked him further,are you sure of what you are saying and he said yes, I saw TsietsieI know him very well.  And then I said to him Tsietsie is in thehouse.  And he got shocked when he heard that.  And then I saidto them, what we have to do is to take Tsietsie to our comradesso that he can explain what is happening.  And then we took comradeTsietsie.  It was the three of us, together with Daniel and comradeTsietsie was fourth person and then we went away with him to lookfor our comrades.  We were told that our comrades were at PiedPiper and we went there.  On the way some of our other comradesjoined us and they were surprised why we were accompanying Tsietsieas they know he was a member of the 3 million gang.  And thenwe went to the club where we found the other comrades but theynever listened to us.  They chased us away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Can you please explain what the club is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> It is a drinking place.  It is a nightclub.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Can you continue please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> When we got there the comrades never listenedto us.  They said we have to leave the place because that placewasn't okay for our comrades.  Because there are other comradesamong us who are being looked for by the police.  Therefore thepolice are still inspecting that area.  Then we left and we wentto another tavern which is called Jack Nose.  It is also a shebeen. When we got there I found the comrades there and I asked them,please comrades, I want to go home together with you so that wecan solve this issue of Tsietsie and then they agreed to comewith me.  We left the place and on the way one of the comrades,it was Tsediso or Daniel who informed the other comrades we foundat Jack Nose of what happened.  He said when (inaudible) at home. On the way one of the comrades asked Tsietsie how did he getto my place and who was with him.  (Indistinct) answering thatTsietsie tried to run away and we chased him until at a housebetween the school and the Roman Church.  We got him out of thehouse and we never asked him anything, and then we started stabbinghim with knives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> What happened after you stabbed him?  Didyou go to the police to tell them about what you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, we went away.  I never went to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> After how long were you arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I was arrested on the 10th June of the verysame year, that is 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> In this case at court, did you find yourselfguilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> What does that mean, when you say "he foundhimself guilty"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Sir, I don't know whether the question wasinterpreted correctly, because I said as far as the indictmentwas concerned, were you found guilty?  Were you found guilty forwhat you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, I was found guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> After you were found guilty, did you everstop to think about what you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, I did, and I regretted what I did. But I didn't do this intentionally.   That was the situationthat was reigning in Maokeng that caused me to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> If you estimate, how old was the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> He was still young by that time, but I don'tknow exactly how to estimate his years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Was he older than you or was he youngerthan you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I would say he was older than me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> The people who stabbed him, among the peoplewho stabbed him, are you the only person who was found guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, there was two of us, me and ComradePatrick Serola(?).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Was he also found guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, he was also found guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Where is he now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> He is still in gaol, that is here in Kroonstad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You will remember that you were told atthe beginning that in order to be afforded amnesty you have toshow that the act you did you perpetrated under political influence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> We now hear that someone was running awayand you chased him and you stabbed him.  To chase a person, apprehendhim and stab him, how does that come in line with politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I can explain like this to you.   The problemis that Tsietsie was a member of the 3 million gang and the 3million gang was the gang that harassed the people of Maokengand the members of the ANC.  They were killing all members ofthe community and all members of the ANC.  Therefore, to end updoing what we did, was to remove the disturbance to the ANC andthe Maokeng community because at that time when the 3 milliongang was operating there was no free political activities in Maokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I want you to understand here, TsietsieLeboko, the minute when he got killed, there is no way where hetried to disturb any free political activity when you killed him,he was running away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Matters are like this.  To end up killingTsietsie, I don't know what was his aim in searching for my home,as he was a member of the 3 million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> What if Tsietsie came there to inform youthat the 3 million gang were to attack you?  Would you know aboutthat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, it was difficult for him to explainthat because he was asked how did he get to my place and whathe was coming to do and then he ran away.  Tsietsie has alreadybeen a member of the 3 million gang and he claimed that he hasresigned from the gang.  But he never did that.  He never showedthat he had resigned because one day he came together with ComradeDaniel and said they had resigned and we accept them, but he wentback, he went back into the 3 million gang and the 3 million gangalso attacked Comrade Daniel who had resigned from the 3 milliongang and he was with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">B J MPONDO:</span> s u o</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> When we last talked you will remember thatI was trying to let you explain to the Committee about this incidentwhere you killed Leboko, how does this come in line with politics. That is where I will start with my questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> This incident comes in line in politicsin this way.  The community of Maokeng, together with the membersof the ANC were not protected by the Government.  So I saw itnecessary that we should protect ourselves and the community bykilling this person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You must remember that at that moment whenyou perpetrated this killing, Leboko was not at that moment harassingthe community.  When you stabbed him were you given authorityby your leaders to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, our leaders only authorised us to protectthe nation and ourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> That is why I ask this question becauseit must be clear to the Committee.  Your leaders didn't say toyou go and kill this person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, they didn't say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Who took the decision to kill Leboko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> We took the decision as the members of theSDU because Leboko is not honest with us because when we askedhim questions he decided to run away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Was the decision taken by the members ofthe SDUs who were present on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, those who were present on that daytook the decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Did you perceive Leboko as someone who wasagainst you and your political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, it is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Why do you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I say that because the activities of the3 million gang were against us because on numerous occasions whenwe held protest marches and boycotts, the 3 million gang memberswould on many occasions disturb such protest and boycotts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Do you realise that Leboko also had parentswho loved him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, I realised that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Now when you appear before the Committeetoday, would you say to the Committee today that this incidentof killing Leboko was okay or is it not at all okay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, I would say that it was not okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> What would you say to Leboko's parents whomyou killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> What I would ask from his parents and thecommunity at large is for them to forgive me because I didn'tdo this because I wanted to.  I was forced by the circumstancesor the situation that prevailed in Maokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MATSEPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> In your testimony you told us that you wantedto have peace in the area of Maokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, it is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did you not think that Tsietsie when comingto you that day, and stating that he had resigned from the 3 milliongang, didn't you think that he was going to promote your needfor peace in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> What brought Tsietsie to us on numerousoccasions, that is the claim that he didn't want to take partin the activities of the 3 million gang.  It was for the secondtime that he came with this request.  He did it the first time,claimed that he had resigned, but he went back to 3 million againand he also took part when they attacked one of our comrades,that is Daniel, together with the 3 million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Was Tsietsie, the deceased, ever a memberof the Youth League previously?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, I don't carry any knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Were you close to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, I only came to know him when he wasa member of the 3 million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> In your own mind, what do you think couldhave prompted him to come to your place of residence&gt;</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I am not sure what brought him to my place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a>Really I don't know what influenced him or forced him to cometo my place. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You further testified that when he was withyou and the other members you had not or you filed to establishexactly the purpose of his visit to you, but all the same youkilled him, you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, that's what we wanted to clarify whyhe came to visit us when we were on the way to get home, but hecouldn't answer us.  What he tried to do was to run away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> In what manner did you ask him about his visit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> One of our comrades asked him how did heget to my place and who was with him when he got there.  And thenhe tried to run away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> What I am driving at is, was he politely askedor was he asked within anger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, he wasn't intimidated.  He was politelyasked.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Comrade Thulo gave us the instruction thatwe have to protect the Maokeng community and the members of theANC and that's what he told us as our general Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I am going to move to your supplementary affidavit,page 2 thereof the first paragraph, and I will quote for you</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a>  "My arrest and convicted arises out of the killing of TsietsieLeboko who was a member of the 3 million gang".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a>Then you say:</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a>  "An ostensibly criminal gang which became affiliated toIFP".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a>Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, I can remember very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> What is it that made you come to the conclusionthat the 3 million gang had affiliated to Inkatha Freedom Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> One day when these people were going tobury one of their members, they used the Inkatha flags.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> On how many occasions did you see this happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> On numerous occasions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> How many times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I can't remember well, but it happened onnumerous occasions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Besides seeing the flags, is there any otherthing that made you come to the conclusion that they were IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, there is.  It happened sometimes thatwhen you are in court these people would have Inkatha badges onthem and one day one of the members of (indistinct) who was BoetieKrag(?) called me whilst we were still in court and he showedme his membership card of Inkatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> We listened to the evidence earlier on thatthe political organisations that were operative in the area wereANC, PAC and perhaps Apla and it was said that Inkatha was notoperative in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, it is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now how could they have affiliated to IFP whenno IFP existed in Maokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I really can't explain how they came tosay they were Inkatha members.  There was no day on which I heardthat Inkatha was coming to launch a branch there at Maokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I want to believe that you will agree with methat then the allegation by the 3 million gang members and yourobservation about IFP may have been unfounded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Still on your supplementary affidavit, page3 thereof, the last paragraph, you said the following</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a>  "We had evidence that the gang was fostered by some membersof the SAP, as a surrogate akin to the "witdoeke" andBlack Cats which has caused a reign of terror in black townships".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a>Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I don't understand your question.  May you</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a>please repeat the question?  I don't understand anything aboutthe Black Cats. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I will repeat the quotation.  Page 3, Mr Chairman,of the supplementary affidavit, the last paragraph.  I am toldit is page 25 of the index</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a>  "We had evidence that the gang was fostered by some membersof the SAP, as a surrogate akin to the  "witdoeke" andBlack Cat which has caused a reign of terror in black townships".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> The police members were the ones who weresupporting the 3 million gang and they were also protecting them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> How do you connect the operations of the 3 milliongang with "witdoeke" and the Black Cats?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> There is no way these two groups come together.Really there is no way they come together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Were these two forces, "witdoeke"and Black Cats operative in Maokeng area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> The "witdoeke" were the membersof the SDU who were staying at Gelukwaarts(?).  They were theyouths who always had white bands on their heads and then we usedto call them the "witdoeke".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Were they formed by the SAP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Mpondo, I am reading from your own affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Mr Mpshe, I don't think that is what heis saying in his affidavit.   He is comparing the organisations,not at the level of their formation, but the fact of their activities. Like the "witdoeke" they sought terror.  He is notsaying that like the "witdoeke" they were formed bythe police.   He is not comparing these movements</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a>or organisations at the formation level, but he is comparing theeffect they had on the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yes, I stand indebted to you, Sir, but he hasjust responded to one of my questions that the "witdoeke"was an organisation or consisted of members of the SDU and theywere called "witdoeke" because they were wearing whitedoeks apparently.  I think that answer from him, if I am correct,bring a different perspective to me.  Because the paragraph reads</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a>  "As a surrogate akin ..."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a>similar to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Not in the sense that they have both beenfostered by the SAP.  Not in that sense.   But in the sense ofreigning terror.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you.  I stand corrected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Do you remember making an affidavit beforeyour attorney on the 29th June of this year?  Do you rememberthat?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And was it the truth that you said thereand which you swore to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, it was the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> In that affidavit you said that the deceasedcame to your house with an unknown member of the 3 million gangon the 11th May, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, I remember that, but I said I madea mistake with the date.  It was on the 4th May.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You said</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a>  "He claimed to have resigned from the gang but it laterbecame known to us that he had come to set</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a>  me up for an attack by the 3 million gang".</p>

<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And you then said</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a>  "When I went with him to the Command of my Unit in ...Maokeng, we were told that he had just alighted from a kombi fullof gang members".</p>

<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You said in your affidavit you went withhim to the Command of your Unit.  Did you go with him to the Commandof your Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, I took him to the other comrades sothat he can tell them what's happening about him, but we didn'tget those comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Why did you say in your affidavit that youtook him to the Command of your Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I was taking him to our leaders but we didn'tfind them there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And you then went on to say</p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a>  "Our Intelligence informed us that he had been instructedto lure me to a spot where I would be alone and where I wouldthen be stalked and killed".  </p>

<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Who is your Intelligence who told you this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> That's what came from our minds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You said your Intelligence, right.  Yousay this is what happened, which you've told us nothing aboutat</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a>all in your evidence today, have you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I don't understand the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You have not mentioned anything about himhaving been instructed to lure you to a spot where you would bealone and where you would be stalked and killed.  You have saidno word of that, have you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I still don't understand which person youare talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You in your affidavit, talking about thisman, said</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a>  "Our Intelligence informed us that he had been instructedto lure me to a spot where I would be alone and where I wouldthen be stalked and killed".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a>You went on to say:</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a>  "When he was confronted by us with this information heran away and we chased him and then stabbed him".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> What I said was, this other girl who cameto me at home, and informed me about the two people from the 3million gang who alighted from the kombi.  She wanted to makeme aware so that these people cannot lure me to another place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> That is not what you said. I am readingfrom what was written down by your attorney, was read over toyou and signed by you.  I think it is your present attorney whowrote it down.  He confirms.  He wrote it down as you told him,and what you told him was that when you confronted the deceasedwith the fact that he was going to lure you to some place andkill you he ran away.  You have not said one word of that beforeus today, have you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a>Can you explain how you told your attorney this completely differentstory?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> It is one story.  I told my lawyer thatthere was a girl who arrived ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You did not.  I am reading to you what hewrote down and what was read to you and what you signed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a>Do you want to read it?  Can you explain how you came to tellyour attorney this?  How he came to write it down and submit itto us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, what I told my attorney is that thisother girl told me about the members of the 3 million gang, therewere two, and she said she was just making me aware so that theycouldn't lure me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So your attorney does not write a word ofthat down and puts a completely false version, is that what youwould have us believe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I think that was a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY JUDGE WILSON</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Mpondo, in your evidence in chief, didn'tyou say that you were informed by Comrade Daniel who came high-spiritedon the 4th May whilst you were with the deceased to tell you thathe had just spotted the deceased inside a kombi full of the 3million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, he told me that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And in fact, you did not hear this from theyoung woman who initially approached you to advise you of thevisit of Comrade Tsietsie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No.  May I please clarify this.  This girlcame before Comrade Daniel arrived and when she arrived she toldme about the two 3 million members who alighted the kombi nearthe church and then Comrade Daniel told me that</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a>he saw a kombi driving past his workplace and it was full of 3million members and he also saw Tsietsie in that kombi that belongedto the 3 million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Mr Mpondo, what exactly did you want tofind out from the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> The deceased, as I said before, was a personwho told us that he didn't want to be a member of the 3 milliongang any more, but he went back to them.  What I wanted to beclear about was the fact that what made him go back to the 3 milliongang, whilst he came to us and told us that he never wanted tobe a member of the 3 million gang any more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Before you decided to take him to your comradesand when you were still in the company of the deceased and Danielat your place, did you ask him, the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, I didn't ask him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Why didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> What I wanted him to clarify before theleaders, I wanted him to clarify this before the leaders, notto me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> And did you have particular leaders in mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, that is why I told the comrades thatwe  have to take him to the leaders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Did you ever take him to the leaders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I was told that my leaders were at the nightclub. When I went to the nightclub I found the other comrades thereand they chased us away and said to us some of us are going tobe arrested because they were being sought by the police and thenthey told us to leave that place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> When he was stabbed, where were you on theway to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> We were on the way to my place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> For what purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> As we didn't find the other comrades andwe were together with the other comrades.  When I am talking aboutthese comrades, I am talking about the leaders, because therewere senior comrades who were not leaders.  I thought they werethe ones who would want some clarify from Tsietsie regarding thisissue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> When he was stabbed with the knife, wherewere you on the way, to what place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> He was stabbed when he was trying to runaway, when we got him out of the house between the Roman Churchand Witeko(?).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> I will try for the third time to put thisquestion.  Where were you taking him to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> We were taking him to my place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Did you think you would find some of yourleaders there at your place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> That is how we were told by one of the peoplethat they were there at the club.  At home there were no leaders. I was taking him home so that we could sit together with him,we and the comrades, and find out from him whether he still wantsto be a member of the 3 million gang or does he want to returnback to the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> After the leaders, Dividi and Masusu, waskilled, how long did it take before peace sort of prevailed inthe area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Do you mean after Dividi and Masusu werekilled?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> This didn't happen immediately thereafter. Masusu was killed first and then Dividi was killed after him. There was still no stability in Maokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> The killing Tsietsie took place about threemonths after the killing of the leaders of the 3 million gang,two and a half months round about, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, what I remember is that Dividi was killedwhen Tsietsie had already been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was Dividi killed after Tsietsie, afteryou killed Tsietsie?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> It may be that I've made a mistake.  I willcheck on it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Mpondo, how many comrades were there atthe time when the stabbing took place of Tsietsie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> When Tsietsie was stabbed, there were somany because we had by that time already met to get us - someof the other community members were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Are you able to approximate, were you 10,were you 15, were you 20?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I think we were more than 20.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Now when you make reference to "comrades",are you referring to members of the SDU, are you referring tomembers of the ANC Youth League, are you referring to people whoalso do not belong to either the SDU or the ANC Youth League,who are merely youth within your community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Usually the SDUs were the people I usedto call "Comrade" at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> So it is only the members of the SDUs who</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a>participated in the stabbing of Mr Tsietsie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, there were also members of the communitywho took part in the killing of Tsietsie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Why did you participate in the stabbing ofMr Tsietsie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I took part in stabbing Tsietsie becauseTsietsie couldn't tell us the truth and what I wanted to do wasto bring about peace and freedom in the Maokeng Township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Mpondo, you say you participated becauseTsietsie could not tell you the truth.  Now, wasn't there anyother means which could have been employed in trying to catchMr Tsietsie and further interrogating him with regard to the truthwhich you wanted to ascertain from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, there was no other way we (indistinct)because he had already shown to us that he wasn't honest withus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> But now if you say he had already shown thathe was no longer honest with you, whereas the reason why you wantedto catch him was to interrogate him to obtain the truth, whichof the two I am unable to find out exactly, what really promptedyou to participate in the stabbing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I took part in stabbing him because I wasalso a member of the SDU and at that time we were very angry regardingthe way Tsietsie reacted when we asked him questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> How did he react Mr Mpondo when you askedhim questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> When we questioned him he didn't answerus.  What he did was to try to run away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And that was sufficient for you to promptyou to stab him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, that decision we took.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> In your evidence you have stated that youreceived orders from your leaders that you were to protect thecommunity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, it is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And how were these orders given to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> We met as the youth of Maokeng and alsoas the youth of the ANC and we decided that because the policeare not acting against the 3 million gang we have to establishour own forces which would protect the nation or the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> When was this meeting whereat you met asa youth and came with that decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> This happened, I think it was in November1990, yes, it was between November and December 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And to your knowledge, when did Tsietsiebecome a member of the 3 million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I am not sure when he became a member ofthe 3 million gang, but when time went by I came to know him asa member of the 3 million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And when did you come to know him as a memberof the 3 million gang, what year was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> We often saw the 3 million gang membersworking(?) here at court.  In 1991 I had a case against me whichI was attending, that was a public violence case, and that iswhere I started seeing the 3 million gang members and I also sawTsietsie there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Was he frequently in the company of the 3million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I don't know, because they were very popularin town, in every place.  You never find them absent in any place. They were full in town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Very popular you said.  One other point. Can you tell me the names of the people who were with you, themore than 20 people who were with you when you stabbed the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, I remember my two comrades with whomI was from home.  It was Comrade Tsediso and Comrade Daniel.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> It was Tsediso Gubuwe and Daniel Mafole(?).</p>

<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I can't remember the others.  There wereso many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But you had gone looking for them, you hadgone looking for these senior men who were going to assist you. You now say you can't remember any of their names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> The comrades I went to look for I didn'tmeet them until I met this other comrades who were at Jackie'sTavern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And who were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> They were the members of the SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I want their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I can't remember their names fully.  Becauseour comrades usually used call names.  That is the members ofthe SDU.  We usually call them call names like Tsiga, they werestrange names, I can't remember them well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You know that if you want to get amnestyyou must make a full and frank disclosure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> What I am telling you is the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Mpondo, did you not live together withthese members of the SDU, were you not brought up within the sameenvironment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I used to live together with them, but notin one area, because at Pumulung, Pumulung is a very big placeand we were in groups.  You find that when we meet I don't knowthem any more.  I wouldn't identify this other one's name is thisand so on.  We are only a group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> How many members of the SDUs stayed in Pumulung?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> The SDUs were founded on the youth and therewere very many youths at Pumulung.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Was every youth in Pumulung a member of theSDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And what proportion of the youth in Pumulungduring your time was affiliated to the SDU unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> It was the youth from Pumulung and otherswere the members of the ANC and others were normally the supportersof the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Let me rephrase my question.  What I wantto find out is of the total youth in your time which was in Pumulung,what was the percentage which was affiliated to the SDU?  Wasit 50% of the youth during your time who were members of the SDU,was it 10%?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I really can't estimate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Didn't the SDUs, were they not under harassmentby the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> They were harassed by police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Did they not operate somehow in a</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a>clandestine manner?  In a secret manner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> They were not secret about anything.  Theyused to harass us.  They didn't hide themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> No, I mean members of SDUs did not theyoperate - because of the harassment of the police, didn't theyoperate in a clandestine manner, in a less open fashion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> The members of the SDU, because of the harassmentfrom the police, we were really hiding ourselves. JUDGE MGOEPE: And you used some code names as it were, some of you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Was it easy to know everybody who was amember of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, especially when we have met.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Was it easy to know all the members of theSDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Mpondo, I only want to add that you arecorrect.  I've made a mistake.  The killing of Mr Dividi tookplace after the killing of Tsietsie.  You are correct in the answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Matsepe, have you any questions to ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Do you remember when Adv Mpshe asked you about the form which you filled in.  Do you remember when you appliedfor amnesty, you filled in a form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, I remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> He asked you about a question which he readto you.  This is the question and I will read it in English. It is question 11(b) on this form.  Before I ask you this question,I want you to explain who filled in this form for</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a>you.   Could you please answer that question first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Comrade Mathabathule helped me to fill inthe form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> It is written here, "Who gave you theinstruction?".  I am talking about the first paragraph. In paragraph (a) it says, "Who gave you the instructions?"and you said, "I received this instruction from Petrus Mashabeof 62 Gelukwaarts".  And you were asked again, "If so,state the particulars of such an order or such an instruction". When Mashabe explained to you about what is written here, didhe do it in English or in Sotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> He did it in Sotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Because here it is written that, "Wasit an order, instructions or an approval?"  Therefore myquestion to you is, when you gave Mashabe this answer, that isthe one person who helped you fill in this form.  Because it talksabout a person who gave you an instruction, or who gave you theapproval to perpetrate the incident you perpetrated.  My questionis, when you answered this question, are you trying to say thatit was Mashabe who said to you on that day, go and kill Leboko,or what were you saying?  We perpetrated this murder because ourCommanders like Mashabe would approve it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I was trying to explain that Comrade Mashabewas a Commander, so he was the one who gave us orders to protectthe community from the attacks of the 3 million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Let me ask this question in this way.  Wereyou trying to tell the Committee that on the 4th when Leboko waskilled, did Mashabe tell you to kill Leboko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> No, I wasn't explaining that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MATSEPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Who completed this form, whose handwritingis it?  Could you perhaps have a look?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> It is Comrade Mashabe Thulu's handwriting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Was he also present when you made your supplementaryaffidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> Yes, he was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did he also prepare some of this document? That is the introduction and the final remarks about the paperbeing sworn?  Did he prepare some of the papers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPONDO:</span> I am not sure about that.   Yes, it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR MPSHE</p>

<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE:</span> He was a policeman, a municipal policemanhere in Maokeng.  Being a policeman I must say I knew him becausewe all stayed in Pumulung.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You knew him just as an ordinary policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE:</span> Yes, he was a policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Did you know him just as a policeman, notin different ways?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE:</span> He was a person who took a lot of partbeing against the members of the SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> We've listened to many facts about the situationthat was prevailing here in Maokeng when there was a lot of harassment. We have heard about the killings that took place, or let me sayabout this 3 million gang as well as many other killings thatwere caused by the members of the African National Congress YouthLeague.  With this matter, the 3 million, how do you perceivethese members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE:</span> They were the criminals terrorisingthe community as well as the members of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> According to you knowledge, is there anythingthat you witnessed that is so wicked in eyes, some of the activitiesthat they were doing to the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Explain then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1572"><a name="pos1572"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> It was on the 12th to the 15th December,that was the day when Comrade Mbelwane(?) was killed.   That isComrade Mduwisile Mbelwane.  We were at the shops.  We saw busescoming, buses as well as kombis.  We were at the shops at Pumulung. They were together with the members of AZAPO.  The police werealso there with these big vans, we used to call it 710.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1573"><a name="pos1573"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Where were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1574"><a name="pos1574"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> The 710 approached from the post officedirection and the kombi was from the tarred road and the bus fromthe 16 Area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1575"><a name="pos1575"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> And what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1576"><a name="pos1576"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> The kombi stopped there and the membersof the 3 million alighted.  We were in a group as members of theSDU.  When they alighted, they came straight to us and that iswhen the 710 approached and the 3 million members, some of themapproached and when we saw them we run to the different directions. Just passing by Mr Qweqwe's house the bus approached us and veryclose to Kanelelo School(?) they alighted.  Now they were comingour direction and then we ran towards (inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1577"><a name="pos1577"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> What were you running from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> We were running from the 3 millionbecause we knew them as dangerous people.  We knew that they weregoing to kill us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Did they say they were coming to kill you? Didn't you know that they were coming for peace maybe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, the way they came you could seethat there was just blood stinking, there was no peace at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> What were they having in their hands thatmade you conclude that they were not peaceful?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Could you see those weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, they didn't hide them.  Theywere publicly carried.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Could the police see them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, the police were there becausethe 710 that I've just referred to was a police van.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> The question is, could the police see them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, they could see those weaponsof theirs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Did the police take any initiative to stopthis that the members were doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, nothing.  That is where ComradeMbuyisile died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I have finished with that.  That was the past. Now at the time of this you were a member of a certain politicalorganisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, I was a member of the ANC YouthLeague.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> When did you join this League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> In 1990, February.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1595"><a name="pos1595"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> During that time were you schooling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1596"><a name="pos1596"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.  I was at Tabong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Where is Tabong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> It is in Welkom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Now when you were schooling in Tabong, whatdid you want here in Kroonstad?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> This is my hometown.  During the holidaysI would be here around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Your home is here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, but I was schooling in Tabong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Please don't be surprised if I ask you whereTabong is.  It is because the members of the Committee not knowwhere Tabong is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> It is in Welkom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1605"><a name="pos1605"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> So that all of us understand what we are talkingabout here.  Being a member of the Youth League of the ANC, whowas the leader of the Youth League in Kroonstad?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1606"><a name="pos1606"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> It was Comrade Matshabethule.  Heused to lead us together with George Daniels, Gashliso, Moaketsi,they were members of the Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Were you present when the SDUs were formed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, I arrived about two weeks thatthey had been formed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Did you join these SDUs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1610"><a name="pos1610"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1611"><a name="pos1611"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Now being a member of this, before this incidenttook place, have you been sought by the police before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> The police looking for you where you were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1614"><a name="pos1614"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, I can't remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> The question is actually whether he was beingsought, looked for by the police, sought after.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1616"><a name="pos1616"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Who was being sought by the police,myself or ....</p>
<p class="line" id="line1617"><a name="pos1617"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> There is evidence, because the police havebeen looking for certain people, members of the SDUs, for differentcases like public violence.  I am asking this to get clarity asto whether have you been sought by the police or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, no police were looking after me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1619"><a name="pos1619"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Now this incident that happened, happenedon the 25th December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> And that is a very respected day, ChristmasDay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1622"><a name="pos1622"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1623"><a name="pos1623"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I want you to tell the Committee that on thisspecific day, where were you and what happened?  How did you killthis person, what happened that you killed him?  Remember thatyou have to convince us with your evidence that the incident ispolitically motivated.  You can now start.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1624"><a name="pos1624"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> We were at Pumulung in Masimung Street(?). We were sitting there, five of us in number.  Whilst sitting,we were at a girl's place called Mansu(?).  We were right insidethe yard.  Now the house is very close to Jack Nose Tavern.  AndI left.  The other comrades, I went to the Tavern to buy a packetof cigarettes and a packet of Simba chips.  Now when I left thatplace I got inside and I met my girlfriend inside this Tavernand I talked to her for a few minutes and I went straight to thecounter.  When I came back she was now at the place called Sebengand she was now in this place called Sebeng.  It is inside JackNose Tavern.  And I went straight to her.  And I was asking herwhat does she want there and she said I am here to entertain myselfand I said to her I've been looking for you, where were you andshe said to me no, I've been ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1625"><a name="pos1625"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Can we avoid some of this detail or is it reallynecessary for your case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1626"><a name="pos1626"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> No, I concur, Mr Chairman.  Listen, I wantyou to do this.  When I ask you to explain everything, and ifI want that question I'd ask you, but I want you to remember thatthere is a person who has been killed here and his name is Boetie. Now tell us the moment when you decided to kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1627"><a name="pos1627"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> While I was in Sebeng Boetie camein and he grabbed me by my clothes and I asked him what are youdoing?  Before he could give me an answer Comrade Pasa Kamponde(?)came and he said what's the problem.  There was no answer still. He took his gun out and then myself and Pasa ran away, we wentoutside the house.  And then when we got outside some of the comradeswere there, Mahawu and Robert Thule and we told them what happened. We told them that Boetie is inside, we don't know what is happeningwith him.  He is taking out his gun and we don't have any clashwith him and we left.  We went next door to a house belongingto a member of the ANC Women League.  The deceased appeared againwith a gun.  We were next to Mrs (indistinct) house and then heleft.  He got into another house opposite.  It was a house belongingto a police called (indistinct) Mutsi.  He was still holding hisgun in his hand and we went to him because we realised that hecouldn't see us and at the corner we grabbed him and we stabbedhim with our knives.  He ran to the next street, we followed him,we stabbed him and he fell the second house.  That's where theincident took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1628"><a name="pos1628"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> We must understand that this incident - whyactually did you decide to stab him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1629"><a name="pos1629"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> It is like this, Sir, if you wantto know.  The police, their actions against the people and ourselves,they have given us that idea.  The police have been with thisgang called 3 million gang, because some of the police were workingtogether with these 3 million gang people, but they were doingit in disguise.  And we only knew one or two of the police, butin most cases we would find out that most of the policemen weresupporting this gang.  Because the community of Maokeng triedto report the gang to the police but nothing would be done, andthat is why we decided that the SDUs must be formed, because thepolice have failed in their duty.  The 3 million gang was killingpeople and it was robbing in town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1630"><a name="pos1630"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Was the deceased, Boetie, a member of the3 million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1631"><a name="pos1631"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, he was a member of the PoliceForce.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1632"><a name="pos1632"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I am asking was he a member of the 3 milliongang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1633"><a name="pos1633"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, I don't have any knowledge ofthat.  No. I am not certain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1634"><a name="pos1634"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> After you were arrested, were you convicted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1635"><a name="pos1635"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1636"><a name="pos1636"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You must realise that Boetie also had a family. This you did unto Boetie, how do you feel about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1637"><a name="pos1637"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I am very regretful of what we did,really I am regretful about what I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1638"><a name="pos1638"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Are there any way words that you can directto his parents or his relatives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1639"><a name="pos1639"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1640"><a name="pos1640"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I will ask you again.  Are there any wordsthat you can direct to his family?  You must understand that youhave taken someone's life away.   Someone who was loved by hisfamily.  Isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1641"><a name="pos1641"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, it is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1642"><a name="pos1642"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Therefore, are there any words that you candirect to his parents, what can you say to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1643"><a name="pos1643"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I would like to say to them, his parentsand the whole family, please forgive me for what I did.  It wasn'tmy intention to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1644"><a name="pos1644"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> When you say it wasn't with your intention,what do you mean, because you took a knife to stab someone.  Weren'tyou aiming to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1645"><a name="pos1645"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, it was because I was angry.  Iwas very emotional at that time because of the situation thatreigned at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1646"><a name="pos1646"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> When you say you were angry, do you mean youwere very aggravated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1647"><a name="pos1647"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1648"><a name="pos1648"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> What were you trying to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1649"><a name="pos1649"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I was saying I was very emotionalat that time and that is what caused me to do that.  We had lostfaith in the police by that time, that is why I took upon myselfto do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1650"><a name="pos1650"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Was Boetie a member of any political organisationthat was against the African National Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1651"><a name="pos1651"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, Sir, I won't say he was a memberof any political party.  But because of the knowledge that thepast regime was oppressive and the people who worked for thatregime were the people who were against the ANC, especially thepolice.  They were really against the ANC at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1652"><a name="pos1652"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You said Boetie had a gun on him, what happenedto that gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1653"><a name="pos1653"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I don't know what happened to thatgun, but I saw it on the following day on another person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1654"><a name="pos1654"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Didn't you on your own take that weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1655"><a name="pos1655"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1656"><a name="pos1656"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> When you attacked him, did you have any objectiveor intention to take his gun away from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1657"><a name="pos1657"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, our intention was just to killhim because ....</p>
<p class="line" id="line1658"><a name="pos1658"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Will you please raise your voice.  I can'thear you clearly.  What was your intention?  Was it to take hislife away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1659"><a name="pos1659"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> When this happened we had lost ourfaith in the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1660"><a name="pos1660"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Is there anything that you want this Committeeto know which I didn't ask you about which you think maybe isnecessary for the Committee to know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1661"><a name="pos1661"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I can't understand you.  Will youplease repeat your question?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1664"><a name="pos1664"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Are you finished with your testimony, or isthere anything that you want to say to the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1665"><a name="pos1665"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> If it is necessary yes, they can askme questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1666"><a name="pos1666"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MATSEPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1667"><a name="pos1667"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> We are agreed that the deceased, Boetie, wasnot a member of the SAP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1668"><a name="pos1668"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I couldn't hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1669"><a name="pos1669"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> We are agreed that the deceased was not a memberof the South African Police.   I will repeat the question.  Weare agreed that the deceased was not a member of the South AfricanPolice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1670"><a name="pos1670"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I knew him as a policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1671"><a name="pos1671"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> When you say "we" do you meanyourself and counsel for the applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1672"><a name="pos1672"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Myself and him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1673"><a name="pos1673"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I will repeat the question.  Do you have anyproblem in hearing the interpretation to you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1674"><a name="pos1674"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1675"><a name="pos1675"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, if you will allow me.  There isa little misunderstanding here.  The applicant did actually respondin Sotho and said I knew him to be a policeman.  That's what hesaid in Sotho.  And how that is going to be interpreted to theinterviewee I wouldn't know.  But we did get an answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1676"><a name="pos1676"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Will you just record what he has given as hisanswer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1677"><a name="pos1677"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, perhaps he spoke too soft thatI couldn't hear him, because I am listening directly from him. I am not using the overheads.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1678"><a name="pos1678"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Quite right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1679"><a name="pos1679"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Could you just repeat the answer you have givenplease and speak loud.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1680"><a name="pos1680"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I said I knew Boetie.  And I knewhim as a Municipal Policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1681"><a name="pos1681"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> We have listened to applicants yesterday andtoday and none of them ever mentioned the involvement of any otherpolice officers other than the SAPs with the 3 million gang. You are the first person.  Do you know why others did not mentionthe other Police Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1682"><a name="pos1682"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> May you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1683"><a name="pos1683"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Just a moment, Mr Chairman.  I am trying toget the channel correctly here.   I will repeat that question. You are the first person today to tell us about involvement ofother Police Force other than the SAPs.   Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1684"><a name="pos1684"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, I am listening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1685"><a name="pos1685"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Do you perhaps know the reason why other applicantsdid not mention the other Police Forces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1686"><a name="pos1686"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1687"><a name="pos1687"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> What involvement did the deceased have withthe 3 million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1688"><a name="pos1688"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> What I want the Committee to understandis that I didn't say Boetie was a member of the 3 million gang,but I said because we had lost faith in the police here at Maokengand the way in which he acted, that was what gave us the impressionthat he was also one of them according to how he acted, becauseI had no differences with him and the way he approached me inthe Tavern is also the fact that gave me that impression thatmaybe he also has a part that he played in this 3 million gang'sactivities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1689"><a name="pos1689"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Before you could stab him, had you establishedanything against him to conclude your mistrust about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1690"><a name="pos1690"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> As I explained that the police atMaokeng operated in an unfair way.  We had nothing against Boetie,or we hadn't proven anything against him or his road(?), but weonly used our minds as people regarding the situation that prevailedin Maokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1691"><a name="pos1691"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Would I be correct to state that you murderedthis man because he manhandled you in the shop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1692"><a name="pos1692"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, it is not like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1693"><a name="pos1693"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Why was he then murdered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1694"><a name="pos1694"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I have explained, Sir, that the reasonthat caused him to die is that - as I explained that the policewere taking part in many perpetrations here at Maokeng.  We didn'tknow all of the policemen who took part in this but accordingto how we saw things happening, the things were happening in frontof our eyes and this is what caused us to lose faith in the police. Because one day whilst we were in town it happened that the 3million gang attacked us, we were from the court, and membersof this gang, when we tried to defend ourselves against them,they ran to the police station and when they ran to the policestation the other policemen came out and these members of thegang had knives in their hands and the police came to us.  Andthen we ran into town.  That's one of the things which gave usthe impression that the police is really supporting this gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1695"><a name="pos1695"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> The deceased was a member of the, if I can callthem, Municipality Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1696"><a name="pos1696"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, it is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1697"><a name="pos1697"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1698"><a name="pos1698"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, it is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1699"><a name="pos1699"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> At any of the incidents whereat you saw thepolice assisting or being involved with the 3 million gang, didyou ever see members of the Municipality Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1700"><a name="pos1700"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, I won't emphasise that becauseI don't know all of them, I mean the Municipal Police.  I takethem all as policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1701"><a name="pos1701"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Don't the SAPs and the Municipality Police,don't they use different uniforms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1702"><a name="pos1702"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, they are using different uniforms,but that time I think they were all using blue uniforms that werethe same as the SAP's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1703"><a name="pos1703"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Before they could change(?), did you ever seethem in their uniform participating on behalf of the 3 milliongang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1704"><a name="pos1704"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, I hadn't seen them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1705"><a name="pos1705"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> The reason why I am asking you this question. I have a very difficult problem in appreciating the reason whyyou killed this man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1706"><a name="pos1706"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> As I have explained, Sir, becauseof the situation that was reigning in Maokeng and the police activitiesin Maokeng we had already lost faith in the police because theyused to harass us and their activities are the ones which causedus to lose faith in them totally.  That is why the deceased endedup dying because we had lost faith in them, because in the wayhe approached us I came to think that maybe he was one of thepolice who worked together with this gang.  Maybe his aim wasto kill him, no one would know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1707"><a name="pos1707"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Would it then be correct to state that you actedon a mere suspicion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1708"><a name="pos1708"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, it is true, as I have alreadyexplained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1709"><a name="pos1709"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> How many of you were present when the deceasedwas stabbed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1710"><a name="pos1710"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> There was three of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1711"><a name="pos1711"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Could you mention names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1712"><a name="pos1712"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1713"><a name="pos1713"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Who are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1714"><a name="pos1714"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> It was Robert Toa(?), William Letaboand myself Gubuwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1715"><a name="pos1715"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> The other two you have mentioned, were theyconvicted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1716"><a name="pos1716"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, we were convicted at the SupremeCourt in Bloemfontein and they made an appeal and they were releasedon appeal.  Now Robert Toa, who was discharged, I am sorry, RobertToa was discharged before the case was finished and William wasreleased on appeal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1717"><a name="pos1717"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You testified that the deceased produced a gunin the shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1718"><a name="pos1718"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I want to clarify this before theCommittee.  I didn't talk about the shop.  It was in the shebeen,that is Jackie's Tavern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1719"><a name="pos1719"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You testified that he produced a gun againstyou in the Tavern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1720"><a name="pos1720"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.  That was when Comrade Mpondotook us apart.  He drew a gun thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1721"><a name="pos1721"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You left and went to a house and he came andentered the neighbouring house.  He came again and produced thegun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1722"><a name="pos1722"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1723"><a name="pos1723"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Then he went past you still with the gun inhis hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1724"><a name="pos1724"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1725"><a name="pos1725"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> In what position was he holding this gun whenhe was from the neighbouring house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1726"><a name="pos1726"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> He had pointed it upwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1727"><a name="pos1727"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Will I be correct if I say that at no stagewhen he was moving from the neighbouring house, at no stage didhe ever point this gun towards you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1728"><a name="pos1728"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Do you mean when he came from thehouse next door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1729"><a name="pos1729"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1730"><a name="pos1730"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, he couldn't see me because wewere hiding.  It was dark in that house where we were in, so hecouldn't see me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1731"><a name="pos1731"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You say it was dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1732"><a name="pos1732"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.  It was at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1733"><a name="pos1733"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Was he moving in the light?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1734"><a name="pos1734"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, because there were lights inthose streets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1735"><a name="pos1735"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> When he produced this gun for the first timeagainst you in the Tavern, did he say anything to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1736"><a name="pos1736"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, he didn't say anything there. He pulled me by my clothes and I asked him what is happeningand he never answered me, and then (indistinct) Mpondo appearedand took us apart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1737"><a name="pos1737"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did you ever have any trouble with him in thepast?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1738"><a name="pos1738"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1739"><a name="pos1739"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1740"><a name="pos1740"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MPSHE</p>

<p class="line" id="line1742"><a name="pos1742"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, I am aware, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1743"><a name="pos1743"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Why didn't you complete this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1744"><a name="pos1744"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I had problems because it was writtenin Afrikaans and I don't know Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1745"><a name="pos1745"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Let's see whether we can assist you as brieflyas possible.  Question 10(a), which you did not complete, asksyou to mention the political objectives which you wanted to achieve.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1746"><a name="pos1746"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> We wanted to have the African NationalCongress and we wanted the community to be free, to have a freepolitical activity in Maokeng.   Because everything that was happeningin Maokeng was prohibiting ANC in its activities and the ANC couldn'tcanvass for support for Maokeng.  Now everything that was happeningin Maokeng Township prohibited the ANC to exist.  We couldn'twork properly as the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1747"><a name="pos1747"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Are you saying that that was also the politicalmotivation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1748"><a name="pos1748"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> That is true, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1749"><a name="pos1749"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Did you benefit financially yourself asa result of this killing, did you benefit anything financially?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1750"><a name="pos1750"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, I never got any financial assistanceor any financial help.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1751"><a name="pos1751"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Another question which you did not complete,asks you whether what you did was the result of any instructionsfrom any person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1752"><a name="pos1752"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> That is true, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1753"><a name="pos1753"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> You didn't answer that question.  Can younow tell us whether you got instructions from anybody to do whatyou did, and if so, who that person is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1754"><a name="pos1754"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> The person is Mr Petrus Matshabetulo(?).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1755"><a name="pos1755"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> When did he give you such instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1756"><a name="pos1756"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I can't remember the month, but wegot orders.  It was in 1990 in December or November.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1757"><a name="pos1757"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> What was the nature of the instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1758"><a name="pos1758"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> The orders were like this. Seeingthat you are the members of the SDU you are there to protect thecommunity and to protect your lives.  Now by all means possibleit is your right to protect the Maokeng community so that theycan live peacefully.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1759"><a name="pos1759"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> If necessary, to kill.  Did you understandinstructions as saying that if necessary, in order to protectthe community, you could kill the enemy, or whoever you thoughtwas the enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1760"><a name="pos1760"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, that's true, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1761"><a name="pos1761"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> What sentence are you serving now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1762"><a name="pos1762"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> It is nine years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1763"><a name="pos1763"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> That is as far as your application formgoes which was not fully completed.  Let us turn to the deceased. You have told us that he was a Municipal Policeman, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1764"><a name="pos1764"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, that is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1765"><a name="pos1765"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> What was the nature of the function of theMunicipal Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1766"><a name="pos1766"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I don't want to commit myself.  Idon't know the nature of their work actually.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1767"><a name="pos1767"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Were they in uniform on duty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1768"><a name="pos1768"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1769"><a name="pos1769"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Were they armed while on duty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1770"><a name="pos1770"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.  I can say they used to carryguns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1771"><a name="pos1771"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Do you think those guns were weapons thathad officially been issued to them in their capacity as policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1772"><a name="pos1772"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, I don't have any knowledge ofthat kind of information whether they were given those guns officiallybecause they were police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1773"><a name="pos1773"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Did they carry handcuffs as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1774"><a name="pos1774"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, I've never seen them carryinghandcuffs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1775"><a name="pos1775"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Could they arrest a person if they saw aperson committing an offence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1776"><a name="pos1776"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1777"><a name="pos1777"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> What is it that you know about them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1778"><a name="pos1778"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I knew them as people wearing greenuniform and the one thing that I know is that they would go arounddestroying other people's liquor around.  They would go into thehouses and destroy the liquor at shebeens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1779"><a name="pos1779"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Are you aware of the seriousness of yoursituation, the situation in which you are?  Do you realise theimportance of this application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1780"><a name="pos1780"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I realise the seriousness, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1781"><a name="pos1781"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> What in your mind did you think was thefunction of the Municipal Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1782"><a name="pos1782"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I don't understand your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1783"><a name="pos1783"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> What in your mind did you think was theduty or function of the Municipal Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1784"><a name="pos1784"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Because they were wearing uniformI would perceive them as police because they were also carryingguns just like the SAP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1785"><a name="pos1785"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Mr Gubuwe, I am trying to, as far as possible,to assist you the fullest opportunity to present your case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1786"><a name="pos1786"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I am listening to you, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1787"><a name="pos1787"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> I am going to ask you again.  Did you thinkthat their duty was to sweep the streets or clean the windowsin the townships, or what did you think was their function?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1788"><a name="pos1788"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Sir, to tell you the truth, I didn'tknow their function.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1789"><a name="pos1789"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Why do you call them policemen?  Why doyou call them Municipal Policemen?  Why don't you call them municipalcleaners?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1790"><a name="pos1790"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> They were called Municipal Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1791"><a name="pos1791"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> And you say to us you don't know as to whetheror not they could arrest a person if he committed an offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1792"><a name="pos1792"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> That one I cannot elaborate.  If itwas their duty to arrest a person they were entitled to, but Idon't want to say anything about the arrests they were supposedto make or not.  But I knew for a fact that the SAPs would arrestyou when committing a crime.  You'd see them guarding the tavernsetc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1793"><a name="pos1793"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> If you are not even able to tell us whetheror not they could arrest a person for whatever offence, why wouldyou be angry with them for not helping put down the problems causedby the 3 million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1794"><a name="pos1794"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Can you repeat your question, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1795"><a name="pos1795"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> I've asked you many times whether you didnot think that Municipal Police could arrest a person for committingan offence and each time you said to me that you did not knowthat.  I don't understand therefore as to why you could blamethe Municipal Police for not doing something about the 3 milliongang if you don't even know that they were supposed to arrestanybody for committing an offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1796"><a name="pos1796"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> When we come to the issue of the 3million gang, it is one of the things that convinced me becausethey couldn't arrest anybody from the 3 million gang when committingcrime, because things have been happening in the presence of everybody,even the police, but nobody could help.  Senator Dennis Bloemcan be my witness that one day it was a funeral of Sono.  We werebuilding a tent.  While building this tent people said to us the3 million gang has stopped people at the taxi rank, the peoplewho are heading for Pumulung cannot go home because the 3 milliongang is stopping them to do that.  We went to the rank and wefound them there and the police station was very close to thetaxi rank.  When we arrived they ran to the police station, theycame back with the police and then we ran away, we took the kombi,we went back to the township.  When we got to the old townshipthe police arrived and they said we are the SAPs, they pickedus up we went to the police station.  Senator Bloem arrived atthe police station and he complained to the police.  He said theseare the comrades.  The 3 million gang is busy robbing people,stopping the people from doing their activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1797"><a name="pos1797"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Sorry, you are busy rattling on.  I am notasking you and I haven't asked you anything about the South AfricanPolice.  I am going to restrict and I am still restricting myselfto Municipal Police.  What did you expect the Municipal Policeto do with regard to the 3 million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1798"><a name="pos1798"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> If they were the real police, if they werepolice they would arrest them for what they were doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1799"><a name="pos1799"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> That is exactly what I am not asking you. I am asking you what did you expect the Municipal Police to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1800"><a name="pos1800"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> To arrest them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1801"><a name="pos1801"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Was it part of their function to arrestpeople then who commit offences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1802"><a name="pos1802"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I don't have any idea as to whetherwas it their task to arrest people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1803"><a name="pos1803"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> You see, you may be blaming people - you</p>
<p class="line" id="line1804"><a name="pos1804"></a>might have blamed the deceased wrongly.   You might have beenangry against the deceased wrongly.  Maybe it was not his functionto do what you thought he should do.   Sorry, you have no commenton that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1805"><a name="pos1805"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Was it a question or was it a comment,Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1806"><a name="pos1806"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Let me just put it to you this way.  Whydid you kill this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1807"><a name="pos1807"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I have already explained, Sir, thatthe deceased was killed because the police was involved in everythingand we mistrusted them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1808"><a name="pos1808"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> As I understand your evidence, you wentinto the shebeen and there much to your surprise you saw yourgirlfriend.  Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1809"><a name="pos1809"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, that is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1810"><a name="pos1810"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And you were having words with her aboutwhat she was doing there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1811"><a name="pos1811"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> That's correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1812"><a name="pos1812"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> She said she was entertaining herself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1813"><a name="pos1813"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1814"><a name="pos1814"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And I gathered that you then said well,you have been looking for her.  Were you annoyed when you foundher there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1815"><a name="pos1815"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, I was not annoyed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1816"><a name="pos1816"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What time was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1817"><a name="pos1817"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I cannot remember the time, but itwas late, towards nine o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1818"><a name="pos1818"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And while you were having words with yourgirlfriend, the deceased came up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1819"><a name="pos1819"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1820"><a name="pos1820"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And he joined the two of you and got involvedwith you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1821"><a name="pos1821"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, he just grabbed me by my clothes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1822"><a name="pos1822"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Is that what made you cross that he didthis in front of your girlfriend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1823"><a name="pos1823"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, that is not the reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1824"><a name="pos1824"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Wasn't it a very annoying thing for someman to come and grab you like that for no reason at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1825"><a name="pos1825"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, that was very annoying, but youknow not to an extent of killing him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1826"><a name="pos1826"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Then he produced a gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1827"><a name="pos1827"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1828"><a name="pos1828"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And you had to get out of the shebeen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1829"><a name="pos1829"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1830"><a name="pos1830"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did you leave your girlfriend behind?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1833"><a name="pos1833"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, I left the two of them behind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1834"><a name="pos1834"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Gubuwe, you have testified that you knewthe deceased because you both stayed in Pumulung.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1835"><a name="pos1835"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1836"><a name="pos1836"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> How long had you both been staying in thesame area prior to his death on the 25th December 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1837"><a name="pos1837"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I knew Boetie in 1991, that was thesame year.  It wasn't even over a year that I've known him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1838"><a name="pos1838"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> How long in terms of months, Mr Gubuwe? Had you just known him for a day before you killed him?  Had youknown him for a week, for a month, two months?  If you could assistus with an estimation of the period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1839"><a name="pos1839"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> It can be a period of seven to sixmonths.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1840"><a name="pos1840"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> You've also further testified that you gotthe order from Mr Thulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1841"><a name="pos1841"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1842"><a name="pos1842"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And the order you got was in December 1990,is that correct, from Mr Thulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1843"><a name="pos1843"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1844"><a name="pos1844"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And what is the precise nature of the orderthat you got from Mr Thulu in December 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1845"><a name="pos1845"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> He said as the members of the SDUswe are there to protect the community in all respects so thatthe people in Maokeng can live safely.  So that they can takepart in political activities in a rightful way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1846"><a name="pos1846"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And you murdered the deceased in compliancewith that order, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1847"><a name="pos1847"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1848"><a name="pos1848"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> There is only one thing which is puzzlingme, Mr Gubuwe, why did you have to wait for seven months to executean order from your Commander?  Can you explain that to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1849"><a name="pos1849"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> What I want the Committee to knowis that the person who gave us a command, he didn't say go andkill the policeman.  He was speaking from the knowledge that healready had and he knew that the police were involved in the violencearound Maokeng and not only a few police, it was a group of police,and we didn't know of the time and the place where the enemy wouldbe but now when the enemy approaches you have to act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1850"><a name="pos1850"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> But Mr Gubuwe, you knew for seven monthswhere the enemy was and you didn't attack?  Didn't you know forseven months where the deceased was whom you perceived as theenemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1851"><a name="pos1851"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I didn't take the deceased as myenemy for the seven months because we've never exchanged wordswith him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1852"><a name="pos1852"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> When did you know him to be a Municipal Policeman? When did you first become aware that he was a Municipal Policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1853"><a name="pos1853"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I saw him wearing a uniform.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1854"><a name="pos1854"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And when was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1855"><a name="pos1855"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> It was about June/July 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1856"><a name="pos1856"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> You must have held meetings as SDU membersfrom time to time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1857"><a name="pos1857"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1858"><a name="pos1858"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And presumably during those meetings youwould discuss your programmes of action, would I be correct inassuming that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1859"><a name="pos1859"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1860"><a name="pos1860"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Had you ever discussed with your membersyour intention to kill Mr Gubuwe as soon as you discovered thathe was a member of the Municipal Police?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1863"><a name="pos1863"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No.   We've never discussed anythingin the meeting that he should be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1864"><a name="pos1864"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Mr Chairman, if you will allow me.  I understandthe question to be Mr Gubuwe who was killed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1866"><a name="pos1866"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I would like you to repeat your question?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1879"><a name="pos1879"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Between the time you joined the SDU, whichis in 1990, until the time when the deceased was killed, are youpersonally aware of any killings made by members of the SDU againstmembers of the police in general?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1881"><a name="pos1881"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Thank you, Mr Gubuwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1882"><a name="pos1882"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Gubuwe, I wouldlike you to listen attentively to this one.  You are remindedof the reason why we are here, then I think you will realise thatyour application here, we have not established who helped youto fill in your statement as it is filled in in Afrikaans.  Whohelped you to do this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1883"><a name="pos1883"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> That application form was given tome by kolonel Els and I filled it in on my own, but because Icouldn't deal with Afrikaans and I was given  limited time, becausethe fax arrived while I was still in gaol on the day I made myapplication and my application was urgently needed and they giveme the Afrikaans application and I told kolonel Els that I can'treally go (indistinct) because I am dealing with this in Afrikaansand then he said there is no time and he faxed the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1884"><a name="pos1884"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Is this Afrikaans your own Afrikaans whichyou wrote with your own hand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1885"><a name="pos1885"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, I am the person who wrote there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1886"><a name="pos1886"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Is this Afrikaans written here written byyou?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1887"><a name="pos1887"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1888"><a name="pos1888"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Here you explain about - if you will justallow me, Mr Chairman.  Because you see you have been asked hereas to why you killed Boetie and whether you knew what the dutyof the Municipal Police was.  If you say somebody is a policeyou know what a policeman must do.   Do you know what is a policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1889"><a name="pos1889"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I don't think you have any doubt about that,surely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1890"><a name="pos1890"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I will concede it, but what I wanted to findout from the applicant, just for clarity for our purposes, I thinkit will get clear what I am trying to get.  If the Chairman canjust allow me to ask my next question.  With your permission,Sir.   Let's forget about Boetie now.  Did you perceive the policeas enemies to the community, or did you perceive them to be onthe part of the community during these activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1891"><a name="pos1891"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I perceived them as the enemies tothe community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1892"><a name="pos1892"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Did you perceive Boetie as a Municipal Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1893"><a name="pos1893"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1894"><a name="pos1894"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Did you see him as a police even though hewas a Municipal Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1895"><a name="pos1895"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1896"><a name="pos1896"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I have no further questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1897"><a name="pos1897"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MATSEPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1898"><a name="pos1898"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Gubuwe, I am going to refer to your applicationform, page 3 thereof.  I will read what you said in Afrikaans. You said "Hy", and I want to believe here the "hy"was the deceased, "Hy het die 3 miljoen bendelede ook beskerm". Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1899"><a name="pos1899"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> May you please repeat the questionor what you have just said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1900"><a name="pos1900"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> In English you are saying, the deceased wasprotecting the members of the 3 million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1901"><a name="pos1901"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No.  I cannot hear you.   No, I don'tcarry any knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1902"><a name="pos1902"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I am going to request Mr Gubuwe to speak loudwhen you answer me, please.  You testified when your counsel askeda question about the application form, you testified to the effectthat this is your handwriting.  Just remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1903"><a name="pos1903"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1904"><a name="pos1904"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Which means that what is written here is whatwas said by yourself or what comes from you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1905"><a name="pos1905"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1906"><a name="pos1906"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now I want you to look again now at this sentencethat I have quoted, the sentence wherein you say he, I want tobelieve it was the deceased, was protecting members of the 3 milliongang, do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1907"><a name="pos1907"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1908"><a name="pos1908"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Please speak loud.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1909"><a name="pos1909"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.  I can see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1910"><a name="pos1910"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> What is it which you experienced or have seenof the deceased for you to conclude that he was protecting the3 million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1911"><a name="pos1911"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> According to the way he approachedhim, I thought he was protecting them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1912"><a name="pos1912"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> The manner in which he came to you then youbelieved that he was protecting the 3 million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1913"><a name="pos1913"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, because he said nothing to me. I asked him what was his reason.  He never gave me a reason. As soon as he saw me he drew out his gun.  And I didn't thinkhe wanted to kill me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1914"><a name="pos1914"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> At that moment were you involved in a fightor a scuffle with any member of the 3 million gang, the time whenthe deceased came on the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1915"><a name="pos1915"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, I didn't fight with any of the3 million gang  members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1916"><a name="pos1916"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now how can you say the manner of his approachshowed that he was protecting the 3 million gang member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1917"><a name="pos1917"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> May I speak?  This person was askedwhat was the reason for him to scuffle me and he never answered. All he did was that he drew out his gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1918"><a name="pos1918"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Gubuwe, to save time, I take it that youdon't want to answer my question.  Let's proceed to the next one,the same paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1919"><a name="pos1919"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Mpshe, sorry, could I just find out. Who helped you to complete this form?  Or who told you what towrite in the form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1920"><a name="pos1920"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> I was with Koot de Ring(?)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1921"><a name="pos1921"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And did he tell you what to write in theform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1922"><a name="pos1922"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, he was only helping me with Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1923"><a name="pos1923"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Just to make a follow-up on that.  If he washelping you in the Afrikaans language, will I be correct to saythat the idea is yours?  The answers are yours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1924"><a name="pos1924"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, he only helped me in the Afrikaanslanguage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1925"><a name="pos1925"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Correct.  If you move further down on that sameparagraph, I will quote, "Ons was ses lede van die YouthLeague".   Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1926"><a name="pos1926"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes, I can see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1927"><a name="pos1927"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Earlier on I recall I asked you a question asto how many were you when you attacked him, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1928"><a name="pos1928"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1929"><a name="pos1929"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You said to me you were three, do you rememberthat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1930"><a name="pos1930"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> Yes.  The people who perpetrated theincident were three.  But when things started we were about five.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1931"><a name="pos1931"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Let's continue on that sentence, the spiritof the sentence.  "Ons was ses lede van die Youth Leaguesaam toe ons hom op straat ontmoet".  How do you explainthat one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1932"><a name="pos1932"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No.  What I know is that we were fivewhen we met on the street, but the people who perpetrated thisincident were three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1933"><a name="pos1933"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did you meet him in the street, did you meetthe deceased in the street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1934"><a name="pos1934"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSEDISO GUBUWE :</span> No, I saw him on the street;  whenhe got out of the house, we got out after him, and then we methim at the corner.   That is where we met him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1935"><a name="pos1935"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> My question is so simple.  Did you meet thedeceased in the street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1936"><a name="pos1936"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I cannot gainsay that.  You say "ons hethard teenoor hom gehaat omdat baie van ons lede deur hulle gedoodis".   He say we hated him, free translation, because manyof our members were killed by them.   Who is this them?   ANSWER:  What I would ask is, I don't understand Afrikaans at all andthe person who was helping me to write maybe he can understandwhat I was saying because I never talked about hatred.   Maybethe person who helped me with the Afrikaans is the one who canunderstand me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1937"><a name="pos1937"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE::</span> Mr Gobuwe, in your answer to what Mr Matsepeasked you, you said you regarded the police as an enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1938"><a name="pos1938"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1939"><a name="pos1939"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did I understand you to mean that you alsoregarded Minister of Police as an enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1940"><a name="pos1940"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Everyone was a policeman sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1941"><a name="pos1941"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Including Minister of Police, that I'm askingyou?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1942"><a name="pos1942"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1943"><a name="pos1943"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> My question really is why did you regard Ministerof Police as an enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1944"><a name="pos1944"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> These people sir according to how things happenedat Maokeng that is what made me perceive them as enemies becausethey were not able to help us when we were being attacked by theThree Million Gang.   So such people I perceived them as enemies,especially because they were wearing uniforms and they had gunson them, so that meant that they were able to protect us and especiallybecause people who were dying had never committed any offencebut they couldn't do that, they couldn't help us out.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2618"><a name="pos2618"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   Mr Bloem we've hearda lot of evidence in this case about many things which happenedover a very long period of time.   I am going to ask you to beas brief as possible when you answer my questions and not to givetoo much detail if I don't specifically ask for it.   My questions,I would just like to give you a general outline of the questionsI'm going to ask, they're going to be dealing with the politicalclimate which reigned here, the membership of the applicants,your position in the ANC at that time and what the ANC's attitudewas in respect of the establishment of so-called "self-defenceunits" and any attempts made in respect of reconciliation.  Lastly, any acts committed against you in relation to the violenceof those days.    Firstly, please tell us briefly what, accordingto you, was the political climate at the time in this area in1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2619"><a name="pos2619"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> After the unbanning of the political parties,a group was formed and was called the Three Million.   The situation,as from September 1990 until 1992, was sheer hell in Maokeng,I can describe it as hell.   Nobody felt safe even just to walkto his toilet at night.   I was a community leader and along withother leaders such as Reverend Gozongo, Mr Lefafa and many othersdid everything we could, everything in our power to bring thissituation to the attention of the government of the day but tono avail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2620"><a name="pos2620"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I would just like to interrupt you here, ifyou could perhaps tell us what your views were regarding the politicalareas in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2621"><a name="pos2621"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes, the political activities were as follows- the ANC in Kroonstad were the majority party.   There was Azapoand the PAC yes those are the two political parties which I canremember but the ANC...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2622"><a name="pos2622"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What about Inkatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2623"><a name="pos2623"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes Inkatha that also came to my attention afterthe Three Million Gang members were arrested by Captain De Reerit then came to my attention that they were members of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2624"><a name="pos2624"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Would you say that there was freedom of politicalaction and conduct that anybody was free to take part in whateverpolitical activities he or she wanted to or was free to belongto any political grouping?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2625"><a name="pos2625"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> According to me Chairperson it was anybody'sright to join whatever political party they wanted to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2626"><a name="pos2626"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> My question to you is were people free to joinwhatever political party they wanted to, for instance could anybodyjoin the ANC or would there have been any obstacles preventinga person from doing so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2627"><a name="pos2627"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> You see in 1990 when this violence and crimewas the order of the day here in Kroonstad, people were very afraidto be seen wearing any apparel that could be associated with theANC, they didn't want to be associated with the ANC in any way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2628"><a name="pos2628"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Why do you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2629"><a name="pos2629"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Because this gang prevented people from for instance,I'm just going to mention a surname, for instance there will seeVan der Merwe with Dennis, then you'd be a target because thenyou'd be seen as an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2630"><a name="pos2630"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What did they do which, in your opinion, preventedthe free political movement and activity of people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2631"><a name="pos2631"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I'm going to give some examples just to demonstratewhat I'm talking about.   In 1990 marches were arranged by theresidents of Maokeng to protest against rental monies and alsoto give expression to other grievances and this Three Milliongang disrupted these marches several times, there were consumerboycotts organised by the residents of Maokeng and once againthe Three Million gang was used to break up this boycott.   Theywere stationed at the taxi ranks in order to guard people andtell people don't be afraid buy in the town you'll not be harmed,we are here to protect you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2632"><a name="pos2632"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What did they normally do when they were busybreaking up a march or a demonstration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2633"><a name="pos2633"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> They arrived in Kombis, we normally started ourmarches at Constantia shopping centre and they would arrive thereand it's obvious the previous witness has already told the Commissionthat if people just caught sight of these people they just ranaway, and that is how the marches and boycotts were broken up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2634"><a name="pos2634"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Are you aware of any other ways, apart fromwhat you've just mentioned, any other methods used by them tohinder the free political movement and activities of people, especiallyANC supporters in this area, anything apart from what you've mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2635"><a name="pos2635"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> As I've already said Chairperson, if they knewthat this person was well disposed towards or was a sympathiserof the ANC, he was immediately a target and they would then ensurethat they would attack that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2636"><a name="pos2636"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Were these attacks only directed at ANC supportersor were the attacks directed at the community at large?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2637"><a name="pos2637"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I think I can say that whether you were ANC,whether you were a supporter or not, people died.   The actualtarget of the Three Million gang was the ANC but the didn't actuallydiscriminate against their victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2638"><a name="pos2638"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Right, I would like to move away from the politicalclimate.   Membership of the applicants in respect to the ANC,as far as that is concerned I'd like you to tell the Committeewhat your position was in the ANC at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2639"><a name="pos2639"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> At that time I was the Deputy Chairperson ofthe local branch here in Kroonstad, the Chairperson was ReverendGozongo.   The applicants were members of the ANC Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2640"><a name="pos2640"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You were personally aware of the membershipof each of these persons?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2645"><a name="pos2645"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I would like to explain it as follows.   Thedefence units were established by the community and the reasonwhy they were established was because of all the various attemptswhich had been made to protect the community from various attacks.  These attempts however, did not help, they were to no availand for that reason the youth and the residents decided to defendthemselves from these attacks.</p>

I convened a meeting with Reverend Gozongo, with theThree Million and with the Youth League.   At this meeting we'djust started with the meeting when some of the Youth League memberssaid that they were not going to speak, they did not want to talkto a murderer such as Diwiti.   I tried, I pleaded with them,I told them that for the sake of peace in Kroonstad we simplyhad to talk and I noticed that the situation was becoming extremelytense and I said to Diwiti that we should rather move away fromthe church because I did not want to see any blood in a church.  Reverend Gozongo also spoke to these people and I got into mycar, Diwiti also got into my car, his sister Florence got intomy car and one other person, Stoffel, Stoffel Mofokeng also gotinto my car.  We drove out of the church yard, we drove to BrentPark.   When we arrived in Brent Park in front of my house...</p>

<p class="line" id="line2659"><a name="pos2659"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The purpose of why I drove away from the churchwith Diwiti in my car was that we could find a calmer situationand climate in which to talk to each other, I could see the situationwas extremely tense and I wanted there to be peace between thesetwo groups.   That is why I drove away with them.</p>

You've already testified that you were a leader.  Can you tell us about any attacks on you personally by membersof the Three Million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2673"><a name="pos2673"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Chairperson, I will mention one such incident.  QUESTION:   If you say you are going to mention one incidentdo you then mean that there were more?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2674"><a name="pos2674"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes that is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2677"><a name="pos2677"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Were these attacks directed at you by membersof the Three Million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2678"><a name="pos2678"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes, yes and I'm now going to talk about oneincident in particular, just briefly.   I was inside the courtroomwith a friend of mine, Cecil Antoni and with my father, Mr Bloem.  The members of the Three Million gang swore at me, they threatenedme, they threatened to kill me in the presence of about 10 policemenwho laughed when they heard these threats and insults.   Thatwas the one incident, I won't go into it any deeper but I willnow mention an incident...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2679"><a name="pos2679"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> As regards that incident, were you, was anythingdone physically speaking to actually carry out this threat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2680"><a name="pos2680"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No, no the reason why nothing was done to mephysically was that I immediately left the scene, I walked awayfrom the courtroom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2681"><a name="pos2681"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Was there an incident that took place at yourhouse, please tell us about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2682"><a name="pos2682"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes in December 1990 or maybe 91, yes I think1991, the Three Million gang went to Brent Park on a Saturday,I was not in the shop.   They went into the shop ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2683"><a name="pos2683"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Just tell us what shop are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2684"><a name="pos2684"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's a general dealer shop which belonged tome.  They went into the shop armed with firearms, pangas, knives,they ran into the shop, they asked my wife Edith where I was. She said that I was not at the shop, and I wasn't.   They thenstarted to grab some of the stuff on the shelves, cigarettes,money, they took whatever they could lay their hands on in theshop.   They told my wife that she must tell me that they wouldkill me wherever they found me.   That was on the Saturday orrather the Friday, no the Saturday.  On that Sunday, the nextSunday it happened again.   They once again came to my shop, onceagain looking for me, they did exactly the same, they took someof my stuff, money etc.  I reported it to the police, these twoincidents, on that Monday it happened once again.   On Mondayat about 4 o'clock I refrained from going to the shop becauseI knew my life was in danger and the shop is a public place whereanybody can enter.   My wife ran out from the back door, she wentto call my father, she wanted help.   My father had a licensedfirearm in his possession, I don't have a firearm.  My fathercame and he also phoned the police.   Now there is a satellitepolice station in Brent Park and this Sergeant, I can't rememberhis surname now, but this Sergeant came, my father detained themin the kombi, he found them in the shop and he detained them inthe kombi.   My father said to them what do you want, you won'tleave here.   I was at home at the time with some of the othermembers of the ANC and the Youth League.   One of my friends ranor drove to my house and came and told me that the Three Milliongang members were at my shop and that they wanted to steal andtake things in the shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2685"><a name="pos2685"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Yes, I think that will suffice.   Was therean incident in which members of the Youth League came to your,or were attacked at your house by the Three Million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2686"><a name="pos2686"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes, yes we were sitting on the stoep and a kombiarrived at my house and some of the members noticed this very,very quickly and they started running away in various directions.  Now I would like to make it very clear to the Committee at myhouse there was a very high wall with fences and gates.   My gateswere always kept locked and nobody could just enter if I was insideand this kombi just drove past.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2687"><a name="pos2687"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> So there was no attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2688"><a name="pos2688"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2689"><a name="pos2689"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Maybe just to round it off Mr Bloem, the kombiwhich drove past your home, what kind of a kombi was it, was ita taxi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2690"><a name="pos2690"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> No, no it was not a taxi there were gang membersinside this kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2691"><a name="pos2691"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What were they doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2692"><a name="pos2692"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> They were planning to attack our friends or comrades,and myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2693"><a name="pos2693"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Is that what you thought?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2694"><a name="pos2694"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Pardon me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2695"><a name="pos2695"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Is that what you thought, that they were comingto attack you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2697"><a name="pos2697"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> The next aspect which I'd like to come to dealswith the alleged involvement of the police in general or the roleplayed by the police in solving these problems.   What can youtell us about that?   Please just wait a moment I will pose thequestion so we can be quite brief, so we don't have a long story.

<p class="line" id="line2698"><a name="pos2698"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I will talk about one incident relating to ameeting at which we talked to the District Commissioner, he'snow Brigadier Van Wyk.

The police intervened, the police were already in Trobo therewhere the Three Million gang members lived.   The police werewaiting in their caspirs in an open piece of land, they were waitingfor the Premier Milling employees.   I was present, I was sittingin a car with a certain Mr Touw(?) to see what the police woulddo.   The police chased away these workers, they shot teargas,whilst the Three Million gang were present amongst the membersof the police in between the caspirs so these people were overcomeby the teargas.

The ANC never foughtagainst the colour of a person's skin, the ANC never gave instructionsto kill anybody, what Joseph Sukudu did I would like, on behalfof the ANC I would like to condemn that in the strongest possibleterms, but I would also like to say that I think the reason whyJoseph had become involved in this incident, well South Africawas an abnormal society at the time of the previous governmentmade murderers of our children.   The previous government pittedblack against white and that is what I can say as far as thatincident is concerned.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2808"><a name="pos2808"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Did you know before he murdered this manhe was going to do it which is not what you said in your 112 statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2809"><a name="pos2809"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Right, I'm not going to explain.   It's entirelycorrect what is stated here, the situation and circumstances inwhich we were at the time forced us to make this kind of statementbut today I came here and I'm going to say exactly what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2810"><a name="pos2810"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> What you did in fact Senator was to deceivethe Court to avoid your own guilt, don't tell me about the circumstances,talk about this case.   You were facing a charge and you deceivedthe Court into believing you did not know the murder was to takeplace, is that correct Senator?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2811"><a name="pos2811"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Chairperson, I'm going to repeat this.   Thecircumstances in which we found ourselves forced us to make thiskind of statement.   We did not trust the South African courts,we were not free to speak the truth, that's why we had to makethis kind of statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2812"><a name="pos2812"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> ...you did not tell the Court the truth,you are admitting that on oath now Senator?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2813"><a name="pos2813"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes that's correct, yes I lied because I didnot trust the courts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2814"><a name="pos2814"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> I suggest to you Senator that you liedto avoid conviction, that you put the blame onto Roland.  CanI have that statement back please?   What have you got to sayabout that, your statement helped to convict him didn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2815"><a name="pos2815"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No I don't think my statement helped to convictRoland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2816"><a name="pos2816"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> He pleaded not guilty and you in your statementsaid that he admitted committing the murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2817"><a name="pos2817"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I say that I simply don't believe that my statementcontributed to Roland's conviction.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2867"><a name="pos2867"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes as I said in my explanation I pleaded withPetrus to try and persuade him not to do this but he refused andhe went ahead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2868"><a name="pos2868"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You didn't think that perhaps you should goalong with Petrus to try and find Diwiti and make peace again?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2870"><a name="pos2870"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Why, how so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2871"><a name="pos2871"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I was under threat from the Three Million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2872"><a name="pos2872"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> So you couldn't appear freely in the streets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2873"><a name="pos2873"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes for about a year I did not go to town, Icould not put my foot there because the whole town belonged tothem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2874"><a name="pos2874"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Apart now from the threats directed at theANC members, were they a band of criminals who committed othercrimes as well or did they concentrate on political violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2875"><a name="pos2875"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> You see previously before the police got a strangleholdon this gang, these people were common township gangsters, itwas a township gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2876"><a name="pos2876"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> The day when the Premier Milling people cameto arrest them do you think such an arrest would have taken placewithout any bloodshed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2877"><a name="pos2877"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> You see the Premier Milling Company employeeshad done so in the past, I think it was in 1986 or 87, the PremierMilling people, the workers had arrested some of the Three Milliongang members and taken them to the charge office at (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line2878"><a name="pos2878"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> So the Three Million gang had existed for quitea long time here, not only from 1986 onwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2879"><a name="pos2879"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2880"><a name="pos2880"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I'm repeating myself now, do you think thearrest on that particular day, in the light of the circumstancesat the time, do you think that arrest could have taken place withoutbloodshed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2881"><a name="pos2881"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The Premier Milling group notified the policethat they were on their way and the police were present, that'swhy the Premier Milling group never thought that there would bebloodshed because the police were present to maintain law andorder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2882"><a name="pos2882"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Yes but now here we see a private group comingto arrest another group and the police intervene and keep themapart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2883"><a name="pos2883"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes that is in fact what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2884"><a name="pos2884"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> One further aspect I'd like to clarify, asregards their disrupting the various protest actions, is it yourevidence that they didn't actually do anything their mere presencecaused people to disband and to run away?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2894"><a name="pos2894"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You said just now that the Three Million gangcame into existence from about 1986/87.   Were they constantlyactive until 1990/91 or was there a period when they were dormant?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2898"><a name="pos2898"></a>QUESTIONS BY MS KHAMPEPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2899"><a name="pos2899"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Bloem I have just two questions for you.  Is the Three Million gang still in existence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2900"><a name="pos2900"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No they do not exist anymore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2901"><a name="pos2901"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Have they become extinct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2902"><a name="pos2902"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> After the leader, Diwiti's, death the gang disbandedthey were no longer in existence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2903"><a name="pos2903"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Petrus, your relative has given testimony beforeus that after the death of Diwiti there was a noticeable changein your community in that whereas the violence was the order ofthe day during his lifetime, after his death peace and tranquillitydescended on the community.   Would you like to comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2904"><a name="pos2904"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Certainly Chairperson, I'm going to illustratewhat joy there was in the community of Maokeng the day when Diwitiwas shot dead.    It was worse than when Nelson Mandela was freed.  Up until today it is quiet and peaceful in Kroonstad.   Schoolswere disrupted, businesses were disrupted, taxis were disruptedand so were churches, nobody could do anything in Kroonstad whenthe Three Million gang were still in existence.   There is peaceand nobody can say today that I am lying, there is peace in Kroonstad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2905"><a name="pos2905"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Senator if immediately after Diwiti's deathsuch peace reigned in this community, would you agree that therewas no need for further killings of other members of the ThreeMillion gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2906"><a name="pos2906"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Chairperson I would like to answer this as follows.  We have never approved of murder.   I don't think that it wasnecessary to take anybody's life before Diwiti or after Diwiti.  I cannot agree that anybody needed to be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2907"><a name="pos2907"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> We have actually listened to evidence by someof the applicants to the effect that they had to protect the communityand in protecting the community certain killings had to be committed.  Your evidence is that there was no need for further killingafter the death of Diwiti, do I understand you properly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2908"><a name="pos2908"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes I agree completely that, I just want to reiteratethat I will never agree with the killing of anybody, whether itwas before Diwiti's death or after Diwiti's death, I don't thinkanybody can condone murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2909"><a name="pos2909"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You have also testified that there was a meetingbetween yourself and Mr Msibi, an official of the IFP?   Wheredid Mr Msibi live at the time of your meeting, where was he staying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2910"><a name="pos2910"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes he came from Welkom, actually he phoned MrLefafa to make the arrangement, the appointment, and Mr Lefafaphoned me and Reverend Gozongo and told us that this person wantedto have a meeting with us about the Three Million gang and thoseof his members, that's what he said.  He went back to Welkom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2911"><a name="pos2911"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you not take the opportunity to discusswith him the involvement of his party with the Three Million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2912"><a name="pos2912"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I assume that Mr Msibi was a senior officialin the IFP and the meeting which we held was enough to talk abouthis members, he said that they were members of his organisationand I assumed that that was sufficient.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2913"><a name="pos2913"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...to the Three Million gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2914"><a name="pos2914"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The Three Million gang started out very smallbut it eventually grew until it had about 45 or 50 members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2915"><a name="pos2915"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Were these members recruited within the ranksof the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2916"><a name="pos2916"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> You see the situation which people found themselvesin Trobo was such that if you were not a part of the Three Milliongang your life was in danger.   Many of these young people hadno clue what it was all about but their parents lived there andthey had to become part of the Three Million.</p>

We went to speak to himthere and tell him that they must come to Mr Gozongo's place thereis a meeting at 6 so that we could hold discussions about peacebetween us and SAYCO(?).   After doing that in the afternoon oneof the comrades came to me and told me that I mustn't allow Diwitithem to go to Mr Gozongo's place because he would be attacked.  I didn't tell him because I knew the leaders would be presentthat won't happen.   Whilst we were still there at Reverend Gozongo'splace, Comrade Dennis and Stoffel wanted to address the meetingand they realised that the youth was not enough there and afterrealising this they asked where the youth were because they wantto know what the fight was all about.</p>

Thencomrade Dennis told them that it is very important people, yousay Diwiti want to fight the youth, there's nothing like that,let the youth come here and hear what the problem is and thensome people went and brought the youth back.   When the youtharrived they entered inside and when they were inside comradeStoffel stood up and explained and Dennis also stood up and triedto explain.   While he was doing that one of the leaders wentoutside and they started quarrelling and said they don't wantto speak to Diwiti because he's a criminal and then one of ourcomrades who is dead now, he was called comrade Matabela he saiddon't say this person is a criminal and that's where the attacksstarted.   Comrade Dennis took us in his car, I was together withDiwiti and Stoffel Mofokeng, I can't remember the other one whowas with us, we went with him in his car and one other child whocomes after me at home went away.   Before we could alight thecar there were four kombis and they attacked, they tried to attackus and we went away where we went to the police station in town.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2955"><a name="pos2955"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I want you now to tell me about the letterthat came to your place, do you still remember about that?</p>

It was comrade Dennis and Blackieand Ronald, that is the one that killed Diwiti.   When they gotthere Diwiti was not there and Matile went outside Matile a letterand Dennis then shook his head at that time and then he went insideand Matile brought the letter into the house.

<p class="line" id="line2968"><a name="pos2968"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> We kept that letter and then Amay(?) informedDiwiti about that peace letter and he was satisfied.   In theevening after we went to court one of the informers came and toldus that he was very threatened, there are people from Johannesburgthey are about to kill Diwiti and they know he is going to courtthis week, that is why they are going to wait for Diwiti.   Thatperson asked me whether Diwiti is there and I said yes he is herebut the person told me please tell Diwiti he musn't go to courtand then I went to Diwiti and told him that there are people fromJohannesburg who came here to kill you.   He said no I have justreceived a peace letter, where is that letter.   The letter wasstill with me and I showed it to him, he read it and he said peoplewant us to defy, this letter had been signed by Amay and he'san M K member, it means those are people which are coming forpeace which I already wanted in Maokeng.

<p class="line" id="line3004"><a name="pos3004"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3005"><a name="pos3005"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I mean a political organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3006"><a name="pos3006"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No, no other political organisation approachedDiwiti, he personally went to Welkom he said sister the ANC peoplecannot help me, I tried Dennis but these people say they don'twant to meet me.   The ministers came together trying to resolvethis issue but there is no solution and then he further went onto say the person who is the Premier today came also to try toresolve the issue, he said it's better if I associate myself witha political organisation maybe there might be a solution to thisproblem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3007"><a name="pos3007"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Which organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3008"><a name="pos3008"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is Inkatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3009"><a name="pos3009"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> From there he wanted to pursue his aims underthe umbrella of Inkatha if I have to use that word?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3010"><a name="pos3010"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I think he didn't pursue his aims.   What hewanted, he wanted that committee, the Inkatha committee becausehe'd already explained that he was a member of ANC.  He thoughtthat they would come for negotiations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3011"><a name="pos3011"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> My question is he wanted something to happenbut the ANC and its leadership couldn't help him, then he thoughtmaybe by resolving to Inkatha his aims, if he wanted peace, maybeit would be better if he associate himself with Inkatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3012"><a name="pos3012"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3013"><a name="pos3013"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> From there he went on to pursue his aims underthe umbrella of this political organisation called Inkatha?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3018"><a name="pos3018"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes I would like the Committee to help us thatthere should be reconciliation.   Many people died, some are injail, even up to this day people are still pointing fingers atus and it is really hurting if people still point fingers at uswhile other people are dead and some are in jail.   Now it seemsas if there is no peace and I would like the community of Maokengto know what happened and they should know that this was not donepurposefully.   I don't know how to put it this message clearthat the evil spirit reigned in Maokeng because when a personwanted to speak something he would be made to keep quiet.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3151"><a name="pos3151"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE::</span> Can I just interrupt you on that point,according to the documents from the office of the Attorney-General,and I'm not sure what the judgment is saying, the applicant facedthree counts of attempted murder and then one of malicious damageto property and then attempted robbery.   In his application hesupplied, if one looks at his application form he's applying foramnesty only in respect of one conviction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3152"><a name="pos3152"></a><span class="speaker">MR V D MERWE::</span> That is right Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3153"><a name="pos3153"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE::</span> I just wanted to make sure so that we shouldnot bother ourselves with the rest of the counts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3154"><a name="pos3154"></a><span class="speaker">MR V D MERWE::</span> That is in fact true, the charge that weare attending to is one of attempted robbery with aggravatingcircumstances, that was the first charge.   The first count theredated 26 August 1993, that matter we will be addressing today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3155"><a name="pos3155"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Attempted what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3156"><a name="pos3156"></a><span class="speaker">MR V D MERWE::</span> Robbery Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3157"><a name="pos3157"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> But the form you have submitted relatesto attempted murder, there is no mention of robbery you have notasked for amnesty in respect of attempted robbery.   You are boundby the form you have submitted and as my brother has just pointedout to you, the application you have submitted relates to an applicationfor amnesty in respect of attempted murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3158"><a name="pos3158"></a><span class="speaker">MR V D MERWE::</span> Mr Chairman that is true, I myself wasnot involved in the drafting of the application.   The secondcharge that is connected to the first charge that was the sameincident, that is in fact the attempted murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3159"><a name="pos3159"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> The first charge isn't before us, you'veseen the Act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3160"><a name="pos3160"></a><span class="speaker">MR V D MERWE::</span> Yes I've seen the Act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3161"><a name="pos3161"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> If someone applies for amnesty he has todo so on the prescribed form.   There is no such prescribed formin respect of anything except one count of attempted murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3162"><a name="pos3162"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Do you want to take instructions or what doyou want us to do because...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3163"><a name="pos3163"></a><span class="speaker">MR V D MERWE::</span> Mr Chairman I was under the impressionthat although I agree with the submissions made by the Commissionerand I've discussed it with my client because I also noticed it,he was under the impression that he was in fact committed, convictedon a charge of attempted murder being the second charge.   I wasunder the impression that by means of the evidence here we couldhave this matter condoned, to have the attempted murder...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3164"><a name="pos3164"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE::</span> Would it help if we were to adjourn a littlebit, you sort yourself out with your client and then specify preciselyin respect of which count he wants to apply for amnesty and thenif it is one count of attempted murder please identify the victimand then we'll take it from there.   I'm not saying the Committee,I can't speak for the Committee, we will take it further fromthere to see what we can do about that, because we don't wantto listen to evidence not knowing exactly in respect of whichcharge the application is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3165"><a name="pos3165"></a><span class="speaker">MR V D MERWE::</span> Thank you Mr Chairman there is no needfor an adjournment it's true that the only charge that we willapply for amnesty is the first charge, being that of attemptedrobbery with aggravating circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3166"><a name="pos3166"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE::</span> Sorry first charge, what are you referringto when you say the first charge, what document are you lookingat I'm looking at the document, the documents that are referredto is attempted murder, three counts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3167"><a name="pos3167"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> I can help my brother, if you look at thejudgment which we've just been given, in the third line it sayswhat the counts are "klagte 1 en 5 is aanklagte van pogingtot roof...aanklagte 2 and 3 is aanklagte van poging tot moord...."</p>
<p class="line" id="line3168"><a name="pos3168"></a><span class="speaker">MR V D MERWE::</span> The victims are stated in the first charge,it is a certain Mr Helepe and a Mr Seping the police officersat that point in time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3169"><a name="pos3169"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> But it doesn't appear on the form so Ithink the form ought to be filled in properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3170"><a name="pos3170"></a><span class="speaker">MR V D MERWE::</span> Could I apply then for an amendment ofthe application to have the charge of attempted murder and thenjust amended by referring to attempted robbery by which is includedaggravating circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3171"><a name="pos3171"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE::</span> Attempted robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3172"><a name="pos3172"></a><span class="speaker">MR V D MERWE::</span> That is attempted robbery, that was thefirst count on which the applicant is...</p>

<p class="line" id="line3175"><a name="pos3175"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE::</span> Mr Mpshe have any of the victims relatingto this count been notified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3176"><a name="pos3176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Yes Mr Chairman they were notified, they areactually present in the hall right now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3177"><a name="pos3177"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE::</span> They are present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3178"><a name="pos3178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> They are present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3179"><a name="pos3179"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Very well your application to amend the applicationis granted to read that amnesty is now sought for the crime forwhich he had been convicted, namely attempted robbery.   Did Iunderstand you to say attempted robbery with aggravating circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3180"><a name="pos3180"></a><span class="speaker">MR V D MERWE::</span> That is correct yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3184"><a name="pos3184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> It seems to us that the applicant in this casewill have to reapply.   He will have to supply satisfactory motivationfor the offence in respect of which he now seeks amnesty, hispresent form does not deal with that at all.   It may be thatonce he has submitted a fresh application and attached to it therelevant documents relating to the charge against him and anyother document which might be relevant, it may then be possiblefor us to consider whether the application should be set downon another occasion for a hearing or whether it is necessary atall for the matter to be decided at a public hearing.   In termsof the Act it may well be, if all the documents are adequatelybefore us, it may well be possible for us to deal with this applicationwithout the necessity of a public hearing.   This is the unanimousand considered view of the Committee.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3200"><a name="pos3200"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Is it true that you were convicted of the murderof a police officer and you were sentenced to twelve and a halfyears' imprisonment on that charge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3201"><a name="pos3201"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3202"><a name="pos3202"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Could you just tell the Committee how did thishappen that you killed this police officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3203"><a name="pos3203"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> On 22 April 1993 it happened that the communityat Masilo complained about a white person who was selling milkmixed with water and this milk was sold to the community of Masilo.  It happened that we burned the car as the community of Masiloand thereafter the police arrive.   These were the SAPS and ontheir arrival the very same police that I happened to kill arrivedand he harassed us, he was talking bad to us, we were togetherwith other comrades and it happened that he saw me among them,he saw me in this whole group of people burning the car.   Hepointed at me, he had a gun and he pointed his finger at me, hesaid it is not the first time that he saw me at the forefront,especially when we were fighting as the community of Masilo.  Fighting those oppressive things by the previous regime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3204"><a name="pos3204"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You see that selling the milk with the extrawater in is oppression of the people, could you define that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3205"><a name="pos3205"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> To sell milk mixed with water I would say it'soppression to the people because it was not the first time complainingabout this kind of milk or some property that was sold to theblack people in the township, for an example rotting meat, thatwould never be taken to the white people in town to be sold, itwould be brought to the black people because they were regarded,I don't know how to put this, but they were regarded as peoplewho do not have rights in the population of South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3206"><a name="pos3206"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Just explain to the Committee how you see thatburning the vehicle of a person cheating the people in an economicalsense can be defined, that he has done the burning of the vehicleas a political objective?   What political objective do you thinkyou gain if you burn the vehicle of the milkman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3207"><a name="pos3207"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Your Honour I think it has been on several occasionsthat we had mass actions to march to the magistrate's office intown so that we can get a solution for everything that was happening.  I'm referring to the things that were happening or that weredone against the community of Masilo, but we never came to a conclusionbecause on many occasions that we've been to the magistrate butno solution at all, that is why we decided as the youth that wewill burn this car when it is coming into the township to bringthat kind of milk again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3208"><a name="pos3208"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...on 22 April 1993 you said this police officer,the deceased pointed his finger at you, could you just explainwhat happened further then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3209"><a name="pos3209"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's true, he pointed a finger at me and onhis other hand he had a long gun and said to me, you see you arealways at the forefront and it is not my first time to see youin wars and everytime when there is violence I see you among thepeople.   Now this time I will never say I will arrest you orI will harass you, but the week will never go by before I couldkill you.   That is what he said with his mouth, he used to eatwith....</p>
<p class="line" id="line3210"><a name="pos3210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Allow his evidence to be recorded please, willyou repeat that again, a week will not go by?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3211"><a name="pos3211"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I said when they arrived there he had this longgun in his other hand and with the other hand he pointed a fingerat me and he said to me I've seen you many times in the riotsand it's not the first time.   Now this time I will not arrestyou or harass you, but I will kill you before the end of thisweek.   That was on 22 April 1993, it was on a Wednesday at aboutpast 11 in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3212"><a name="pos3212"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...the deceased again? (Start of question isoften lost due to lack of microphone).</p>
<p class="line" id="line3213"><a name="pos3213"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I met the deceased again at about past 12, thatis past 12 midnight, that is when I met him on that day.   I didn'teven realise it was him, it was now on 23 April when I met him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3214"><a name="pos3214"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Where did you meet him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3215"><a name="pos3215"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I was passing next to a hall, a community hall,I was from my girlfriend's place, I passed next to a shebeen,I didn't go inside I only passed, I think he saw me passing. Now when I was very close to the hall I heard a voice from behind,the voice said "man stop".   When I looked it was himwith a gun in his hand pointing at me and I stood, I asked himwhy do you want me to stop, what do you want from me when youpoint the gun to me like that?   He said unacceptable words andI felt very regretful not to say these words, he said to me let'sgo to Paul's place and I asked him what are we going to do atPaul's place?    He said don't ask me many things because he hadthis terrible thing in his hand, a gun, and because at that timeI was scared of death I listened to his orders and we went anywherewhere he wanted us to go to.   When we approached Paul's area,the street in which Paul lived, it happened that he was far behindme, you know we were not walking close to each other, he was behindme.   I thought that this person he wanted to detain me becausehe took me by force, I must say he took me by force because Inever thought that he wanted me to go to Paul's place.  I washeading for my home to sleep.   Now according to his orders Idid what he ordered me to do, it's because he had a gun in hishand, I was not armed I did not have a stone in my hand, nothingand he slapped me on the, in that same street because he was veryclose to me.   I got angry and I disturbed and I was aggravatedand I got scared and I grabbed him, you know I just grabbed him.  I don't have any authority to take anybody's life, God is theonly person who can take people's lives because he knows if hetakes a person's life, what is he doing with that.   It wasn'tmy intention to battle with him until his gun was on my side andI shot him.   I shot him three times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3216"><a name="pos3216"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Can you just explain on which basis you saythat by killing this police officer you seek to further politicalobjectives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3217"><a name="pos3217"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I can say this to the Committee, it wasn't myintention at all to kill him because I was trying to protect myself.  In trying to protect myself against him he could have killedme actually if I didn't protect myself and I believe that it wouldnever appear before the court of law because he was working fora very corrupted government.   I'm really sorry as I'm here beforethe Committee and before the community and to all the people thatI've acted against, his family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3218"><a name="pos3218"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Were you at that time a member of any politicalorganisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3219"><a name="pos3219"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I was a member of the African National CongressYouth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3220"><a name="pos3220"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Do I understand you correctly to state thenthat you killed this police officer in self-defence, is that yourversion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3221"><a name="pos3221"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes I believe it is true, that is what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3222"><a name="pos3222"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I would still like you to just elaborate onthe matter of the political objective that you sought by doingso.   Could you just elaborate on that please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3223"><a name="pos3223"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> He hasn't said he had one has he, he saidhe acted in self-defence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3224"><a name="pos3224"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Could you just explain to the Committee howdo you see, because to make out a case here today you have toprove that there's a political objective involved in the killingof this police officer.   Could you explain how you bring thisself-defence matter into line with a political objective, if thereis any?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3225"><a name="pos3225"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The main issue is that I was not intending tokill a person at that moment, it wasn't my intention but the deceasedwas against the community not for the first time but on many occasions,myself included.   Everytime when we had mass actions, boycottingthe rent, organising stay-aways, you would find him together withother policemen against the community, assaulting small childrenand elderly people.   They didn't care about anybody who getsinjured or doesn't get injured.   My aim was not to kill I wasjust protecting myself.</p>

On page 3 of your applicationform under paragraph 9 (a)(iv) Mr Chairman and members of theCommittee, the last sentence I will quote that sentence.   Itreads</p>
<p class="line" id="line3241"><a name="pos3241"></a>  "He was also known as ANC political opponent".</p>
<p class="line" id="line3242"><a name="pos3242"></a>Do you remember you saying to your scribe that? </p>
<p class="line" id="line3243"><a name="pos3243"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I remember sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3244"><a name="pos3244"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What is it that the deceased did for you toarrive at a conclusion that he was ANC political opponent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3245"><a name="pos3245"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> As I've indicated from the beginning, I saidwhen we had mass actions complaining against the rent boycottsand organising stay-aways he was a person or they were the peoplewho assaulted the community in a very severe way, irrespectiveof whether it was a child or an elderly person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3246"><a name="pos3246"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Would you agree with me if I say if he didas you state, he was simply carrying out one of his obligationsas a police officer and not that he was targeting the ANC at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3247"><a name="pos3247"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Sir I don't think he was fulfilling his obligations,everytime he would assault people who are innocent, people whodo not fight, who do not break or people who do not disrupt anyparty(?).    He would assault people marching to lodge a complaint.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3248"><a name="pos3248"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> The passage you put to him was that hewas also known as an ANC political opponent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3249"><a name="pos3249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Yes Mr Chairman, it is the last sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3250"><a name="pos3250"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Shouldn't it then be correctly read "...andpresumably being SAP member he was also known as ANC politicalopponent"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3251"><a name="pos3251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Yes Mr Chairman, members of the Committee thatcan also be because it appears thereon.   I stand indebted forthat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3252"><a name="pos3252"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I want to move to paragraph 10 of your applicationform, 10(b), the second paragraph thereof.   The sentence startsby saying</p>
<p class="line" id="line3253"><a name="pos3253"></a>  "...We then decided to remove him or do something so tohave that pressure relieved, to have access to fight for our birthright."</p>

<p class="line" id="line3258"><a name="pos3258"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I'll read the next sentence to you, you said</p>
<p class="line" id="line3259"><a name="pos3259"></a>  "It was just I met him alone but I can assure you everyonewas prepared to do it.   The pressure was irresistible and thatwas the only option."</p>
<p class="line" id="line3260"><a name="pos3260"></a>Did you hear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3261"><a name="pos3261"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No I can't remember that very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3262"><a name="pos3262"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> If I heard you correctly in your answer tome earlier on, you stated that this commander from Tanzania, therewas a meeting and the discussions were not finalised, did yousay so?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3264"><a name="pos3264"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What is it that was not finalised?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3265"><a name="pos3265"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> A decision was not taken as to whether we killthis person or not, the meeting was adjourned on that day whenthis was said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3266"><a name="pos3266"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I'm now moving to page 4 Mr Chairman, membersof the Committee of the application form, paragraph 11(a), asa follow-up on what you have just said now that no decision wastaken to remove or eliminate him, is the reason why on paragraph11(a) when asked as to whether the offence was committed in anexecution of an order or on behalf of for which the approval ofthe (indistinct) Liberation Movement, State Department or securityforce concerned, you answered by saying the following</p>
<p class="line" id="line3267"><a name="pos3267"></a>  "No there was no official order on behalf of ANC."</p>

<p class="line" id="line3272"><a name="pos3272"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Is it the reason why in answer to questionon paragraph 11(a) you said no there was no official order onbehalf of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3273"><a name="pos3273"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Sir as I have explained earlier that this formor these forms I didn't fill them in on my own, I asked someoneand explained to that person that please fill in these forms forme because I was trusting that person and that is why I said tohim I want to go to phone my parents and I realised that I couldn'tdo away with going to the phone because the police at the prisonwould hold their own meetings, can you understand that, and thereforeI was in a hurry of not being limited by time, that is why I askedthat person to fill in the form for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3274"><a name="pos3274"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Paragraph 11(a) is not what you told him, isthat what you are saying?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3277"><a name="pos3277"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I explained to the Committee that when I shotthe deceased three times he slapped me and I got frightened becauseI could see he had a gun on him and I saw on many a times whata gun can do to the people, especially when it was in the handsof the people like the police.   I realised that if I could tryto run away he was going to kill me and that is why I say I wasvery scared and I got emotional and that's how I found myselfstruggling with him until the gun got into my hands.   I justpressed and then he got shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3278"><a name="pos3278"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Jackson I will repeat that question andhelp you by saying he slapped you, now after slapping you I understandyou to be saying you had the gun in your hand.  When you startedshooting, what was he doing after the slapping?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3280"><a name="pos3280"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> When you shot at him he was still grapplingwith you am I correct, is that what you are saying?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3373"><a name="pos3373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Mr Segopa do you realise that when you talkabout "marashi" here a person might think that you arespeaking about people from Russia, do you know about that, thepeople who stay overseas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3374"><a name="pos3374"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3375"><a name="pos3375"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Do you know of the Russians who are overseasin Russia, do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3376"><a name="pos3376"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> Yes I've heard about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3377"><a name="pos3377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Now please explain whether you are speakingabout those people or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3378"><a name="pos3378"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> No "marasha" is a gang that wasoperating in the mines and it used to attack people, they calledthem "marashia".</p>
<p class="line" id="line3379"><a name="pos3379"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> What membership are they and what languagedo they speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3380"><a name="pos3380"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> They are mostly Sotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3381"><a name="pos3381"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> So you say you heard about these over theradio and when people were speaking around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3382"><a name="pos3382"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> Yes I heard so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3383"><a name="pos3383"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I am going back now, when you linked yourselfwith this incident what did you have in your mind when you didthis?  What were you thinking you were trying to solve by then,or what were you doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3384"><a name="pos3384"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> My aim was to do away with apartheid.  I wantedus to live together with the Whites, I didn't want to have apartheidanymore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3385"><a name="pos3385"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Now if you wanted to live together with theWhites a question may arise that these people who came to yourtownship, I mean these White people maybe to entertain themselves,why did you kill them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3386"><a name="pos3386"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> By then apartheid was reigning, that was in1990.  The Whites did not like blacks at all, so when we saw themin the township we thought they belonged to the Inkatha so wedecided to do away with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3387"><a name="pos3387"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> You see one thing I think is not clear inyour evidence is that why do you associate these people with Inkathabecause they are White people, because you explained earlier thatInkatha had Black members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3388"><a name="pos3388"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> Yes Inkatha had Black members and White membersand we heard over the radio that these Whites who belonged toInkatha used to smear themselves with a black substance and thengo and attack people in places like Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3389"><a name="pos3389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Do you mean Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3390"><a name="pos3390"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> Yes Sebokeng and places like Johannesburg. Yes I heard this over the radio.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3391"><a name="pos3391"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> What did you hear over the radio regardingthese White people who are smearing themselves with a black substance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3392"><a name="pos3392"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> They smeared black substance on their facesand they attacked Black people after doing so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3393"><a name="pos3393"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Did you hear this over the radio?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3394"><a name="pos3394"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3395"><a name="pos3395"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Were these White people you saw, did theyhave black substance on their faces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3396"><a name="pos3396"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3397"><a name="pos3397"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> So why did you associate them with Inkatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3398"><a name="pos3398"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> I thought they also were some of the Inkathamembers or their supporters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3399"><a name="pos3399"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Do you understand that this is a bad incidentthat happened which you committed on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3400"><a name="pos3400"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3401"><a name="pos3401"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> What can you tell the deceased's family regardingthis, that act that you committed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3402"><a name="pos3402"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> I would like the deceased's family to forgiveme and the community also to forgive me regarding this act thatI committed during that political time in 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3403"><a name="pos3403"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MATSEPE</p>

<p class="line" id="line3477"><a name="pos3477"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> The evidence provided was incorrect. He wasnot telling the truth because he was someone who was bought tocome and oppress some of the witnesses like I was withdrawn fromthe court case so as to come and oppress some of my fellow accused. I was withdrawn from the case for some time.  Afterwards thepolice came to me to come and lead evidence against some of thefellow accused.  Because if I could not do that they would drivethe case against me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3478"><a name="pos3478"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And you've told us that after you lit thecar it took two minutes to kill all four of them, do you remembertelling us that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3484"><a name="pos3484"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And they chopped her with axes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3485"><a name="pos3485"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> They did chop her with axes and they stabbedher with pangas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3486"><a name="pos3486"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And stabbed her in both her eyes, thisevidence was given at the trial wasn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3487"><a name="pos3487"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> It is true they did stab her but I cannotreally tell whether they did stab her in the eyes but she wasbadly stabbed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3523"><a name="pos3523"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> No that evidence was not true, it was givenby people who were bought to say so.  I even want to believe thatthose people were not there when this incident occurred.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3532"><a name="pos3532"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But you heard the evidence at the trialthat they said you followed the people and you jumped from a truckwith other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3533"><a name="pos3533"></a><span class="speaker">MR SEGOPA:</span> Yes I heard that but it wasn't true becausepeople who were giving evidence they were lying.  They were nottelling the truth.</p>

My intention is to call a witness on behalfof Mr Segopa but this witness was also an applicant and I intendto withdraw his application and remove it from the roll.  I don'tknow whether I should withdraw the application before and thencall him as a witness.  In other words I don't want to close theapplication for Mr Segopa at this stage but I still have to withdrawthe applicant.  Which one to do first, that's the direction Ineed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3551"><a name="pos3551"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did the other applicant instruct you towithdraw his application?</p>

Sorry do you understand the differencebetween removing it from the roll and withdrawing it, becausethere's a difference?  If we withdraw the application it meansthat he can never be set down he will have to re-apply.  Mr ChairmanI would like to remove, my instructions are to have that applicationremoved from the roll, they are specific about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3553"><a name="pos3553"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Is the application properly before us havingregard to the Act?</p>

All the residents of Kaotlahong,especially those who stayed at Mushingoville(?) because they forcefullysettled there at Kaotlahong.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3600"><a name="pos3600"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Were there any Inkatha people who attacked,who harassed people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3601"><a name="pos3601"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> This happened on many occasions when we werecomplaining about some things as residents and (tape 10B ends)...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3602"><a name="pos3602"></a> Plans, that is our plans as Kaotlahong residents so that theycannot achieve what they want to achieve.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3603"><a name="pos3603"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> How did they disturb you or what act didthey take to disturb you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3604"><a name="pos3604"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> They used to intimidate and threaten people,that is the residents of Kaotlahong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3605"><a name="pos3605"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> What did they do actually to threaten thesepeople?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3606"><a name="pos3606"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> They threatened them by saying that they wouldattack them so that they cannot achieve their objectives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3607"><a name="pos3607"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Please you are confusing Mr Mokabe.  Everytime when he tries to say something you start laughing and youmake such a noise and by so doing you confuse him and maybe youcause him not to remember what he was about to say.  Thank youMr Chairman.  Mr Mokabe please we want to understand what yourevidence is all about, just concentrate on what you are saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3608"><a name="pos3608"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> Yes Sir I will do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3609"><a name="pos3609"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I am trying to find from you, or let me sayyou mean these people verbally threatened the residents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3610"><a name="pos3610"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3611"><a name="pos3611"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Weren't there any acts that they were committing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3612"><a name="pos3612"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3613"><a name="pos3613"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Four people were killed on that day, nowthe applicant here, I mean Mr Segopa said to us he thought orsomeone said these people belonged to Inkatha that is why he tookpart in those killings.  Now my question to you is because thesepeople were White what can you say regarding that Mr Segopa couldhave thought that these people belonged to Inkatha, what can yousay about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3614"><a name="pos3614"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> When one looks at the political climate thatprevailed during the 1990's or in 1990 Mr Segopa had to be frightenedbecause there were still threats that the "marashia"Inkatha will attack the residents, and I believed that, that theKaotlahong residents at that time were living under fear, theywere living with fear regarding those threats.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3615"><a name="pos3615"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Regarding those threats that had been madeagainst them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3616"><a name="pos3616"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> Thank you Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3617"><a name="pos3617"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Now I want to know were you living with herat that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3618"><a name="pos3618"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> Yes because I was a resident of Kaotlahong. I also lived with her because I didn't know what kind of peoplewere Inkatha people especially when they were on the rampage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3619"><a name="pos3619"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> How did you think Inkatha was, or what kindof an organisation did you think Inkatha was regarding the rumours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3620"><a name="pos3620"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> According to my knowledge, in fact we didn'tknow what kind of people were Inkatha people.  Let me explainin this way, we never had an Inkatha branch at Kaotlahong andthat is why the residents of Kaotlahong did not know a thing aboutInkatha and that is why they didn't know what kind of people wereInkatha people.  We only used to hear about Inkatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3621"><a name="pos3621"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I want to know whether these rumours couldmake it known to you whether Inkatha was a political organisationor a football organisation, I don't want to put words into yourmouth, please explain to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3622"><a name="pos3622"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> It was rumoured that they were killers whowould murder people wherever they go and they would brutally doso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3623"><a name="pos3623"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Where did you hear these rumours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3624"><a name="pos3624"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> We heard the rumours at Kaotlahong becausethere was another rumour of which I don't have the evidence andthe rumour was that the Inkatha and "marashia" ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3625"><a name="pos3625"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Did you hear about Inkatha on the radio?</p>

There was a rumour of which I don't have any evidence orI don't know who told people about such rumours that the "marashia"or Inkatha are going to attack.  That is they are going to attackthe Kaotlahong residents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3633"><a name="pos3633"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Mr Mokabe I would like you to listen attentivelynow because this question has to be clarified.  I am not talkingabout the rumour that there is going to be an attack at Kaotlahong,I'm not talking about the rumour, I am talking about this groupcalled Inkatha.  I want to know what kind of organisation didyou know Inkatha as?  You said they were an organisation thatused to attack people?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3656"><a name="pos3656"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> I do not know what time it occurred, I didn'thave a watch by then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3657"><a name="pos3657"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> If you could remember was it around about sixo'clock in the afternoon or what time would you say it occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3658"><a name="pos3658"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> No I do not have a vivid knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3659"><a name="pos3659"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> As you are the member of the ANC as a marshallwhat we would call a self-defence unit do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3660"><a name="pos3660"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> Yes I do know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3661"><a name="pos3661"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did you have a SDU in your community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3662"><a name="pos3662"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> Yes Sir.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3664"><a name="pos3664"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3665"><a name="pos3665"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> As a marshall also being a member of the ANCI think that the most members of the ANC within your communityyou are known to them, or you know them, Mr Justice Segopa haveyou ever seen him in any or at any of your meetings, was he amember of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3666"><a name="pos3666"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> I will explain in this manner about Justice. Justice is one person who was interested in politics but havinginterest in politics I did not have much knowledge about Justicewhether he was a member or not but I found him very active.  Sometimeshe would help where necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3667"><a name="pos3667"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> So to say that Mr Justice was active what didyou see him doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3668"><a name="pos3668"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> I saw him attending meetings that we heldin most times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3669"><a name="pos3669"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> So being at the meetings does it tell thathe was active within the ANC, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3670"><a name="pos3670"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> That is how I perceive the matter, that heattends most meetings and then I can say that this person is interestedin what we are doing here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3671"><a name="pos3671"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Mokabe would you agree with me when I saythat Justice Segopa attended your ANC meetings to listen justlike any other person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3672"><a name="pos3672"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> Yes I agree with you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3689"><a name="pos3689"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And that the people feared an attack frommembers of one of the taxi groups?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3690"><a name="pos3690"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> Yes that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3691"><a name="pos3691"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And was that the position at the time ofthe attack, round about?  Did he speak the truth or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3692"><a name="pos3692"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> He did speak the truth, those were the conditionsat that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3693"><a name="pos3693"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So he said nothing about the involvementof Inkatha at all, he said it was rivalry between two taxi groups?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3694"><a name="pos3694"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> He did speak about those incidents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3695"><a name="pos3695"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes but I put it to you that accordingto the information before us in the papers that he spoke of rivalrybetween two taxi groups but he didn't mention Inkatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3696"><a name="pos3696"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKABE:</span> What I remember clearly is that he did speakabout "marashia" in his evidence and also about Inkatha,he did speak about Inkatha when he gave evidence before the courtin Virginia.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3707"><a name="pos3707"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I have indicated earlier that I just wanteda last final consultation which will not last long with the otherapplicant just to set my mind at ease.  Maybe we might have toapproach you in chambers regarding the problem I am facing withthe next applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3708"><a name="pos3708"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Well will you try and expedite matters as quicklyas you can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3709"><a name="pos3709"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Mr Chairman I will certainly do that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3712"><a name="pos3712"></a>COMMISSION RESUMES</p>
<p class="line" id="line3713"><a name="pos3713"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Which applicant are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3714"><a name="pos3714"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I am talking about Justice Segopa the oneI am presently with.  I Have the intention actually Mr Chairmanto make a substantially motivated submission to the Committeeand in the light of the fact that I haven't been able to preparethat submission my request therefore to you would be to grantme your indulgence and also give me time to prepare written submissionswhich would be submitted together with the other applicants thatI represented during the course of the week.  And which submissionsI confirm would be made available to the Committee within twoweeks hereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3715"><a name="pos3715"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman I had indicatedto my colleague that I am ready to address the Committee on thisparticular application.  But I would leave the application, hisapplication to the discretion of the Committee Mr Chairman andI would follow whatever is decided upon.  Mr Chairman before theChair decides on the application by my learned friend Mr Chairmanthe Committee would note that I did not call any witness in theform of victim or next of kin to the victims in Justice Segopa'sapplication.  I did not do so because these are not available. I have caused to be placed before all members a document whichis a report from the investigating unit in Durban and I referyou Mr Chairman and the honourable members of the Committee particularlyto page 10 thereof up till the end of the document wherein thereport about the next of kin in this application is well laidout.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3716"><a name="pos3716"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Do you tender this as evidence, this report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3717"><a name="pos3717"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I don't hand it in as evidence but I hand itin to support my explanation as to the reason why the next ofkin are not here, because this is a report submitted to me bythe investigating unit as to what they have done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3718"><a name="pos3718"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Ja.  The only reason I am asking is becauseI think we should, if it's tendered as evidence it should be givento the attorney or to the representatives so that they could haveit before them and if they want to counter anything they shouldbe able to do so.  But if it's only as far as victims are concerned,and not tendered as evidence I think it could go in, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3719"><a name="pos3719"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> We will receive it as an explanation as to whythe next of kin are not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3720"><a name="pos3720"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  And further Mr Chairmanif I may add I refer the Chair and the honourable committee membersto page 10 thereof it starts from page 1 and that document givesthe names of all the next of kin to the victims in all applicationsthat were handled today.  Now this is in compliance with the requestby the committee member Advocate de Jager yesterday that namesof next of kin should be supplied.  This document covers all thatis required.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3721"><a name="pos3721"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Thank you Mr Mpshe.  Now as for your argumentthat should be addressed now by Mr Matsepe you say that you requiretime.  The facts are very, very simple in this matter Mr Matsepe. Most of it is common cause.  Do you still require time to addressus?  I know you mentioned something about ...(indistinct) individuationcan hardly be advanced in the case where the accused did not giveevidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3722"><a name="pos3722"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Mr Chairman that is precisely what I wouldhave like to research.  That accompanied by the fact that in today'sapplication we actually heard that the applicant was having theimpression wrongfully or rightfully that the victims were membersof Inkatha, and the criteria for judging his actions should thatcriteria be a subjective or an objective one?  I am of the viewthat I might come up with some authority that would support thesubmission that I want to make to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3723"><a name="pos3723"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Matsepe the Committee is appreciative ofthe fact that you stepped into this case at a very late stageand may not have had enough time to consider certain legal aspectsthat might arise.  That being so we are agreeable to afford youan opportunity to hand in your written argument at a later stage,but I think we should fix a time.  You say that it should be afortnight from today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3724"><a name="pos3724"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3725"><a name="pos3725"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> What date is that Mr Matsepe?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3727"><a name="pos3727"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Very well.  This matter will now be finalisedin as far as the hearing of evidence and argument is concerneduntil after we have considered a written argument from Mr Matsepeand Mr Mpshe, and these have to be handed in by not later thanthe 12th of August 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3728"><a name="pos3728"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> I thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3729"><a name="pos3729"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Mpshe would you make arrangements aboutadequate to enable you to (tape 11A ends)...his argument in sufficienttime to enable you to respond to it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3730"><a name="pos3730"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yes Mr Chairman that will be done with him,I will arrange that with him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3732"><a name="pos3732"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSEPE:</span> Mr Chairman may I take this opportunity tothank the Commission, the Committee for hearing me and I wishto be excused now because it appears that this is the last ofthe applicants I shall be representing.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3762"><a name="pos3762"></a><span class="speaker">MS DITHEBE:</span> As far as the child's schooling is concernedthere is government grants that I receive but it's not enoughto help us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3763"><a name="pos3763"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> After the death of your husband did you institutea case or a charge against someone who killed your husband sothat you will be paid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3764"><a name="pos3764"></a><span class="speaker">MS DITHEBE:</span> No I never did so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3765"><a name="pos3765"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Who buried the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3766"><a name="pos3766"></a><span class="speaker">MS DITHEBE:</span> It was myself.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3775"><a name="pos3775"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mrs Dithebe this Committee before you it isestablished by a certain law or Act which refers to reconciliationand the truth.  What are your views with regards to truth andreconciliation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3776"><a name="pos3776"></a><span class="speaker">MS DITHEBE:</span> As far as reconciliation is concerned myselfas a deceased's wife I cannot forgive the killer or the murdererbecause he could not forgive my husband for what he had done. To show that he apologised he bought two quarts for him but thatnever meant a thing.   Based on that I sit here because I heardthat he asked for amnesty.  I would not lie because I would notforgive him.  If my husband was here I would not be strugglingas I am at the moment.  My child would have the warmth of havinga father.  He does not have the love of a father of which he couldhave had would his father be living at this time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3777"><a name="pos3777"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Let me put it this way Mrs Dithebe if it couldhappen that Tamsanga who killed your husband could come here andmeet you to talk with you and apologise to you how would you takethat matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3778"><a name="pos3778"></a><span class="speaker">MS DITHEBE:</span> What I am saying is I would not accept hisapology.  I would say so but deep down in me I would not haveforgiven him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3779"><a name="pos3779"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Is there anything that you want to tell thisCommittee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3780"><a name="pos3780"></a><span class="speaker">MS DITHEBE:</span> To this reconciliation committee what I wouldsay is this, I am not against the aim of this committee but Iam against the killer of my husband.  What I would say is thisat the moment I don't have the love of my husband and my childmisses that too.  There is no forgiveness that I would directto Mr Jackson.  I don't want to lie to the committee even if thecommittee can forgive him but deep down in me I would not forgivehim.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3782"><a name="pos3782"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Are there any questions you would like to putto her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3783"><a name="pos3783"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Only a couple ofquestions.  Mrs Dithebe at the time of your husband's death washe politically active?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3784"><a name="pos3784"></a><span class="speaker">MS DITHEBE:</span> He never had any interest in politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3785"><a name="pos3785"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> No the question is was your husband activelyinvolved in politics at the time of his untimely death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3786"><a name="pos3786"></a><span class="speaker">MS DITHEBE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3787"><a name="pos3787"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Do you know whether your husband had previousconfrontations with Mr Jackson prior to the date of the bad incident,the death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3788"><a name="pos3788"></a><span class="speaker">MS DITHEBE:</span> I do not know of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3789"><a name="pos3789"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Jackson testified yesterday that theprevious day your husband threatened him that he would kill him,do you have your own personal knowledge of this fact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3790"><a name="pos3790"></a><span class="speaker">MS DITHEBE:</span> I don't have such knowledge, even duringthe court trial he never mentioned such a thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3791"><a name="pos3791"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV DE JAGER</p>
<p class="line" id="line3792"><a name="pos3792"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Was this man Jackson a friend of your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3793"><a name="pos3793"></a><span class="speaker">MS DITHEBE:</span> He was not a friend to us at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3794"><a name="pos3794"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Do you have any profession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3795"><a name="pos3795"></a><span class="speaker">MS DITHEBE:</span> I do not have any profession at all, I amnot working as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3796"><a name="pos3796"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Mpshe will you at a convenient stage enquireinto whether, in the circumstances of this case, whether she wouldbe entitled to any relief under the Act from the Reparations Committeeand if so you will make a report to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3797"><a name="pos3797"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That will be done Mr Chairman.  Mrs Mewa(?)I think you should understand that I don't want you to be leftwith wrong impressions, I think you should understand that itdoes not necessarily mean that you would get any reparation. There are certain legal requirements which would have to be metbefore you could qualify for that kind of grant.  Depending onhow this application is disposed of it may very well be that youcould qualify and depending also on the nature of the outcomeof our decision it may very well be that you do not qualify. It is in fact strictly speaking not this committee that is goingto decide whether you qualify or not but it is the law as it stands. And please do not leave here under the impression that you areautomatically going to qualify for reparation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3798"><a name="pos3798"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Thank you very much.  You are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3799"><a name="pos3799"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line3800"><a name="pos3800"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman then that sums up evidenceas far as matter number H is concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3801"><a name="pos3801"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3802"><a name="pos3802"></a><span class="speaker">MR      :</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman the applicantyesterday in his evidence, as well as in his application statedcertain facts on which he based his application.  I must be honestI've got difficulty in supporting this application insofar asit is connected as the act, the offence being committed to obtainor further a political objective.  Taking the factors stated insection 20(3) of the Act being the motive, the context in whichthis matter took place or the offence occurred as well as thelegal and factual nature of the act and the gravity of the offencethe objectives as well as the relationship and the directnessand proximity I must admit that I am in dire straits to honestlyand openly state that I feel that  a case has been made out tomeet the requirements of section 20 of this Act.  I have got nothingfurther to add.  Should the Committee wish to hear me on certainother matters I would be glad to respond to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3803"><a name="pos3803"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Very well, Mr Mpshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3804"><a name="pos3804"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman I am alsoin the same position as my colleague Mr Chairman.  Suffice itfor me only to say that the applicant David Jackson did not satisfythe requirements of the Act particularly section 20 and its subsectionsMr Chairman.  Mr Chairman will recall in the minutes of the committeethat at one stage under cross-examination by myself I put a questionto him as to any political achievement and he was very clear hesaid nothing politically was achieved by the killing of this man. Mr Chairman and members of the Committee I just want to directand state clearly that this what the applicant did it was donebecause of a fight between himself and the deceased and as hestated in his evidence-in-chief that he did as he did becausehe was defending himself, and it is as simple as all that.  Iam at pains Mr Chairman to find any political motivation whatsoever. And I would urge the Committee to find, with respect, likewise. That is all Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3805"><a name="pos3805"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> (?)  It may be that I am confusing these cases,I know that he said he was defending himself but was the contextof his evidence, does the context of his evidence suggest thathe is trying to say that he was defending just beyond himselfas an individual?  Did he not say that the deceased worked fora corrupt government and the deceased was against the community,he had been against the community many times, every time we hadmass action or boycott or rent boycotts, stayaways you would findhim and others assaulting children and people left, right andcentre.  I am trying to say to you are we married to the literalwords that come out of his mouth to say I was defending myself,doesn't the context of his evidence suggest that he saw the deceasedas a danger to the community at large?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3806"><a name="pos3806"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman and members of the Committee. That is the evidence he gave and that is the impression he wantedto create in the minds of the Committee.  But I want to say thisthat we should not lose sight of the fact that this whole incidenthappened as a result of alcohol that was consumed in a tavernat night.  And the evidence that he gave in court does not atall suggest that he was acting as he did in protection of thecommunity.  It may well be that he said so in evidence when pushingfor his application, but my impression is that he is saying thisas a person who is here to be released out of jail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3807"><a name="pos3807"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MGOEPE:</span> Are you saying that had the deceased notbeena policeman and had he not had the idea that the deceasedhad in any case been ...(indistinct) of the community, are yousaying that he would still have killed him anyway had the deceasednot been anything other than a policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3808"><a name="pos3808"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That is my point, that is my point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3809"><a name="pos3809"></a> Then Mr Chairman and honourable members of the Committee thatrounds up the roll for the Kroonstad hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3810"><a name="pos3810"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> The Committee will consider this applicationand makes it decision known in due course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3811"><a name="pos3811"></a> Ladies and gentlemen we have come to the end of the hearing ofthe Amnesty Committee in Kroonstad.  The Committee will now terminateits proceedings and thank you very much for behaving well mostof the time.</p>
