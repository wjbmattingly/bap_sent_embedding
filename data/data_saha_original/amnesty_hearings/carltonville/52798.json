He told me that the very same gang robbed him and pointed at him with a gun.\n\tAt the very same year in August 1991, Matsaba's family were attacked by the very same gang and that is when a child died in this event.  \n\tIn September before ...[intervention]",

As we were sitting there there was this other group in this other room and there were some girls from the same section who were in the other room.  \n\tAs we were sitting there this comrade went to see this friend of his who had invited us to the party, and when he came back he came back with three drinks and put them on the table and comrade Mokome who was stabbed, he left our table and joined this group of girls.  \n\tAs he was sitting amongst these girls, Big Five and Malgas arrived, and when they got there they went straight through to talk to Mr Mokome.  As they were talking to Mr Mokome, Big Five drew a knife.

            "Comrade Mokome left with comrade Sekome and this was in Block 8 but we are staying in Block 7.  Comrade Mokome left with Sekome to Block 7.  We were still at the party that was being thrown by comrade Mokome's friend.  Myself, comrade Steve and comrade Boyki and comrade Gustaff had remained.  The four of us had remained in the party, comrade Mokome and Sekome had left to comrade Mokome's house.\n\tAs we were sitting there, comrade Sekome came back and when he arrived he told us about the attack of comrade Mokome.  Having heard that we left to see where this happened.  When we got there we found comrade Mokome covered with a blanket and he was in a pool of blood.  I uncovered him to see how much injuries had he sustained.  He wasn't saying anything, he was just lying in this pool of blood.  We covered him again.\n\tWe were busy looking for a car and other comrades were there already.  His family were looking for a car to take him to the hospital and we were standing by as comrades.  We discussed this matter and the issue of this gang, that they have committed so many crimes in the township and in the section and all of these have been reported to the police but they are not taking any action, therefore it is better for us as comrades of the ANC Youth League and the comrades in Block 7, to go out and search for these criminal gangs so that we would hand them over to the community that would in turn hand them over to the police.\n\tWe got information that this gang was being accompanied by the two girls that Mokome was chatting to at the party.  The one was a border at Mokome's house.  We discussed this and we decided that we should find this lady and she should show us where this gang stays in the township.  \n\tWe went to Joel's place and when we got there, Joel himself is the one who - when we entered Joel's yard we proceeded straight to the shack where Rebecca and her parents were staying.  Joel is the one who knocked in that shack and Bafadile is the one who opened the door and explained exactly what happened and even asked her that we needed to buy Bafadile's help to go and show us where this gang stayed.  It's her mother who opened the door and who Joel was talking to, and she gave us the permission to take her with.\n\tWe left with her and went to the tavern called: \"White House\" where they used to drink, and another tavern which is Lebitsos, when we got there, and when we got to the taxi rank we met, we found a kombi and comrade Steve asked the driver to help us but he can only help us until 11 o'clock because he knocks off.\n\tHe helped us, he took us with this girl and we went to a tavern called: \"Blue Lagoon\".  When we got to the Blue Lagoon tavern we were told that this gang has just stabbed another comrade called Darkie, who was staying in the Xhosa section in the township, they have just stabbed him.\n\tThey started with comrade Darkie and that is when we decided or we saw that this gang is quite determined to terrorise all the comrades in the township.  From the tavern we proceeded to Spurs Tavern and we found nobody there.  We came back to search for this gang at their homes, their families and relatives, but we never found them.\n\tOn our way, still in this kombi, we were intimidated by BafAdile and told her that she will take full responsibility for comrade Mokome's death: \"You'll be the one who will be arrested unless you help us or tell us\".  That is when she told us that these people when they are not here in Kutsaong they are in Bekkersdal, they've got a shack there in the X section. \n\tWe took her back home.  We did nothing to her and even her mother was happy with her.  Having taken her back home, we thanked the driver of the kombi and we went to Leboneng at the same night of the 7th and we had to discuss what to do further, as we got the information that these people, if they are not here they run to Bekkersdal because nobody seems to be able to arrest them.  Therefore we must meet the following day at 8 o'clock in the morning and we should go and search for these people in Bekkersdal.  Yes, we went separate ways to sleep there.\n\tThe following day I had to go with the Interim Committee of the ANC Youth League as we had a meeting that we had to attend in Gagiso in Krugersdorp.  I did not go there because Gordon Mahuma who is the comrade's secretary, came to me and said that we had to go, but I told him exactly what happened yesterday.  I told him what happened the previous night and what our intention, as the comrades of Block 7, have decided to do.  We were going to catch those people and bring them to the community that will decide whether they hand them to the police or not.\n\tI told comrade Mahuma to put in an apology for me in the meeting.  He did so but he never told me what the response was of the committee.  I went where the comrades had gathered and I found comrade Steven van Rooyen who was telling the other comrades that were not there the previous day, as to what happened.\n\tOn my arrival I told them that I've met comrade General Secretary, Gordon Mahuma and I told him everything that happened yesterday and our intentions as comrades of Block 7 and he will in turn report this to the Interim Committee when he meets.  That is when we decided - as the comrade has already mentioned, we were between 30 and 35 in number, we decided to go to Bekkersdal and we could not all go, only 17 could go.\n\tWe were 12 ANC Youth League members and we had five young pioneers.  That is when Joel Mokoena and Morupisi went to negotiate at the taxi rank two kombis which they came with but he told us that the drivers just wanted petrol ...[intervention]",
