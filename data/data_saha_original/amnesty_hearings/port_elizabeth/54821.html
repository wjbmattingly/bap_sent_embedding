<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>MR KEMP:   Chairperson, the next applicant is applicant number 5, Jacobus </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>Kok.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>JACOBUS KOK:  (Duly sworn, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>EXAMINATION BY MR KEMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>	Mr Chairperson, before I proceed with the evidence in this matter, as </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>in the case with Mr Du Toit, an amendment was placed before you after the tea </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>break.  Similarly amending paragraph 8 of the application for amnesty to </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>include the possibilities or the sub-crimes indicated in that notice. I merely </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>want to point that out, that it has been handed to the Commission.  I will be </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>referring to the application of Mr Kok as set out ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  And are you formally applying for the amendment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>MR KEMP:   Yes. Yes, indeed. I do not know procedurally whether it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>necessary to apply for an amendment. It is merely an addition to the present </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>application, but in so far as it is necessary, I will seek such an amendment of </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>the application, both in the case of Mr Du Toit and Mr Kok.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   It is actually an amendment, even if it is an addition.  So </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>anyway, the amendment is granted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>MR KEMP:   Thank you, Mr Chairman. I will be referring to Volume 1 of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>documentation before the Committee and in particular, to the application of </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>Jacobus Kok, as it appears from page 92 onwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>	Mr Kok, would you please look at page 92. You will there see that this </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>is an application for amnesty in terms of Section 18 of the Act. The names </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>which appear there, the address, identity number, et cetera, is that correct, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>this your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>MR KOK:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>MR KEMP:   The application goes as far as page 114 of the document. So it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>23 pages long, the application itself and it was drawn up by you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>MR KOK:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>MR KEMP:   Do you confirm the correctness of what appears in that </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>MR KOK:   Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>MR KEMP:   You were also a member of the South African Police and </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>attached to the technical section of the security branch during 1989. Is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>MR KOK:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>MR KEMP:   Who was your commanding officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>MR KOK:   My commander at that stage was Lieut-Col Du Toit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>MR KEMP:   It is common cause that during 1989 and in particular, on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>13th of December 1989, certain events took place at the technical section, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>in which you were involved on that day. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>MR KOK:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>MR KEMP:   These events related to what later became known as the </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>Motherwell matter. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>MR KOK:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>MR KEMP:   How did you become involved in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>MR KOK:   It was during December 1989. I don't have any independent </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>recollection of the precise date, but I now know that it must have been about </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>the 13th of December.  During the morning, Col Du Toit called me to his </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>office and told me that there was to be a very important operation in Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>Elizabeth.  He briefly explained to me that it turned on the matter of askaris </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>that had or were about to defect to the ANC.  He further ordered me to prepare </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>certain explosives and the manufacture of an explosive device.  Since the </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>people had to be eliminated by means of an explosive device.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>MR KEMP:   Was it conveyed to you that it had to take place by way of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>motorcar bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>MR KOK:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>MR KEMP:   Were you told in what way the explosion had to take place? In </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>other words did it have to take place by means of a limpet mine or commercial </p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>explosives or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>MR KOK:   It would take place by means of a remote control device.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>MR KEMP:   And the explosives to be used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>MR KOK:   I prepared - I wasn't informed exactly what the circumstances </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>would be, and I didn't know who the targets were to be.  So I prepared for any </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>circumstances underground and I used a commercial and a military type of </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>explosive and I packed these and came down to Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>MR KEMP:   What was the relationship between yourself and Du Toit at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>MR KOK:   I was attached to the mechanical section and Col Du Toit was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>commander of that section.  We carried out certain covert actions and these </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>actions were done on a need-to-know basis.  We had a very good </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>understanding.  We trusted each other completely and if information was </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>conveyed by one person to the other, it was dealt with on that basis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>MR KEMP:   How long had you and Du Toit been working together at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>MR KOK:   I joined in May 1982, that is the technical section that I joined. So </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>it was approximately seven years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>MR KEMP:   It is common cause that Du Toit and yourself later travelled to </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>Port Elizabeth. How did you get there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>MR KOK:   Du Toit informed me that De Kock would arrange for a vehicle </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>along with cash to buy our food and fuel expenses and we left for Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>Elizabeth in a black Jetta.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>MR KEMP:   When did you start the journey and when did you arrive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>MR KOK:   It was the afternoon after De Kock had been to Waal du Toit, with </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>the request for technical support and we left at about eight or nine that </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>evening and arrived at Port Elizabeth the next morning, the 14th of December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>MR KEMP:   After your arrival in Port Elizabeth, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>MR KOK:   I don't know Port Elizabeth at all. I didn't at that stage. We </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>stopped at a garage along the Marine Road, Beach Road and it was early </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>morning, it was sunrise when we arrived at Port Elizabeth, and Du Toit </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>phoned Nieuwoudt from a coin phone and he was to meet us at a specific </p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>point. I also didn't know Nieuwoudt at all and I met him there for the first </p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>MR KEMP:   Did he take you to a place in Port Elizabeth thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>MR KOK:   Yes, Nieuwoudt drove in front of us and he took us to safe </p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>premises. I don't know where these premises are, I wouldn't be able to tell you </p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>at all in what suburb it was, because I wasn't familiar with Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>MR KEMP:   When you arrived at this place, whom did you find there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>MR KOK:   I can't remember what time we arrived there, but when we did, two </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>members of Vlakplaas, Snor Vermeulen and Lionel Snyman were already </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>there.  Then there was also a person, a stranger present. I didn't know him at </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>all. Deon Nieuwoudt was there as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>MR KEMP:   Did you see Martiens Ras there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>MR KOK:   No, I didn't even know at that stage that Martiens Ras was in Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>MR KEMP:   What happened at that house on that morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>MR KOK:   There was a short meeting, which was led by this person, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>during that meeting it was confirmed that we were part of this order operation </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>to prepare the explosives and to place it in a vehicle which would be provided </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>to us by Nieuwoudt, and that's what was discussed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>MR KEMP:   Did you later leave this place and go somewhere else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>MR KOK:   Yes.  The meeting didn't take place for very long.  I am not sure </p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>how long.  Waal and I then left those premises, that was in convoy.  Whether </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>we drove with somebody I can't recall, but we went to a certain point in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>city where we waited.  At some point Deon Nieuwoudt joined us and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>followed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>MR KEMP:   Was he driving the same car in which you had gone to the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>MR KOK:   I can't recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>MR KEMP:   He left you somewhere along the road and what did he go and do </p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>MR KOK:   I really am not certain, I am not sure what the arrangements were. </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>After the meeting we withdrew, or I personally withdrew so in retrospect I can </p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>say that perhaps he went to fetch the car, but I am speculating.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>MR KEMP:   You have no independent recollection of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>MR KOK:   No, I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>MR KEMP:   After his return were you waiting for him in the city?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>MR KOK:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>MR KEMP:   Did you then depart for some other place?  Where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>MR KOK:   Yes, he took us along various routes, I don't know what these </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>were, and we eventually arrived on the outskirts of Port Elizabeth at an </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>isolated spot, and we stopped there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>MR KEMP:   Were there any houses nearby?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>MR KOK:   No, no, there were no houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>MR KEMP:   What happened at this place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>MR KOK:   We prepared the vehicle, and placed the explosive device in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>car and we complied with our technical responsibilities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>MR KEMP:   Who were present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>MR KOK:   At that stage I also saw Martiens Ras, there were three Vlakplaas </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>members, myself, Waal du Toit and Deon Nieuwoudt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>MR KEMP:   You say the three Vlakplaas members, apart from Martiens, who </p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>were the other two?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>MR KOK:   It was Snor Vermeulen and Lionel Snyman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>MR KEMP:   What were their roles at this place where you arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>MR KOK:   I found out there, and it was confirmed to me, that their main </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>purpose was protection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>MR KEMP:   In preparing the vehicle, did you receive any help from anybody </p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>other than Du Toit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>MR KOK:   The technical responsibility was basically that of Du Toit and </p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>myself, and it might be that somebody else gave us a hand, but I can't say for </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>MR KEMP:   The explosives were placed in the vehicle, what was the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>MR KOK:   It was a white Jetta. </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>MR KEMP:   Where did you place the explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>MR KOK:   There were charges under the four seats and especially under the </p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>mats.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>MR KEMP:   These charges were connected to cortex?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>MR KOK:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>MR KEMP:   And this cortex was linked with another device?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>MR KOK:   In the final configuration it would have been like that, but we left </p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>this for the last operative, the one who would be responsible for using this </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>device.  It would be safe to drive this vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>MR KEMP:   I just want to refer you to page 106 of the documentation. You </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>see in paragraph 6.3.1, the second line, the third last word refers to </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>(springdoppies) pellets.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>MR KOK:   No, it is a typing error, it should be pellet (springdoppie).</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>MR KEMP:   After you put these explosives in the vehicle, whose </p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>responsibility was it for eventually activating this device?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>MR KOK:   I don't have the information who was finally responsible but I left </p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>it to Deon Nieuwoudt who was responsible for this operation.  I explained to </p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>him how to activate this pellet initially.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>MR KEMP:   And how to arm it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>MR KOK:   I call it a link-up but it has to do with the arming of this device.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>MR KEMP:   Did you know for whom this bomb was intended?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>MR KOK:   Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>MR KEMP:   Later you heard the names of the people who were killed?  Did </p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>you know any of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>MR KOK:   Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>MR KEMP:   After you had prepared the vehicle, can you give an indication </p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>what time it was when you finished?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>MR KOK:   I can't remember an exact time, but it was during the afternoon </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>round about three, four o'clock that afternoon, I am not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>MR KEMP:   What did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>MR KOK:   We withdrew and went back to Pretoria.  Meaning us, I and Waal </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>du Toit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>MR KEMP:   Did you drive directly to Pretoria or did you sleep over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>MR KOK:   We went straight to Pretoria, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>MR KEMP:   And the next morning you were back at work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>MR KOK:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>MR KEMP:   When did you hear whether the bomb was successful?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>MR KOK:   I can't remember a specific day, it might have been the next day, </p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>when we came back to our office, I heard over the radio that there had been a </p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>bomb explosion in which four people were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>MR KEMP:   Did you at any stage doubt the instruction to ask for your co-</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>operation, that it was not a lawful instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>MR KOK:   I did not doubt it, that it was an unlawful instruction.  I never </p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>thought that people would be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>MR KEMP:   Mr Chairman, if you can just grant me an indulgence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  I don't think that was the question posed to you. It was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>whether it was lawful that you were justified in killing people.  The question </p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>was whether you doubted whether you should do it or where the instruction </p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>came from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>MR KOK:   I trusted Waal du Toit implicitly and I was convinced and up till </p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>today, I am convinced he would not have given me an instruction if he knew </p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>that was an instruction cleared by head office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Did he indicate to you that that was an instruction, an </p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>MR KOK:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  What did he tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>MR KOK:   He said there was a certain operation, I had to get all things </p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>together to prepare such an explosive device.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Did he tell you where this order came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>MR KOK:   I didn't ask him.  He did mention that it was a supportive function </p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>we had to do for the Port Elizabeth security branch in co-operation with </p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>Vlakplaas members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  You see, it is strange that you are saying this, but in your </p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>application on page 102 you say that he told you that it was a direct order </p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>from the security head office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>MR KOK:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  This is exactly why I am asking you, and you give a </p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>different kind of answer, that you trusted him and he didn't tell you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>MR KOK:   I can't specifically remember what I have written here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  It is not what is written there, it is what is the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>MR KOK:   I'm telling you the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Mr Kok, were you ever charged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>MR KOK:   Yes, I was. </p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   How did you plead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>MR KOK:   I pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   What was your version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>MR KOK:   I gave no version, I refused to say anything. I did not give </p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   How was your case presented during your trial regarding </p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>this alleged participation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>MR KOK:   I was charged as an accused in the murder trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   What was your version, was there any version put by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>State witnesses regarding your participation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>MR KOK:   Basically what is presented to the Committee, that was what was </p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>said by Snyman and Vermeulen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Were there allegations that you were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>MR KOK:   Yes, there were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   What was your reaction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>MR KOK:   I denied that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   So ... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>MR KOK:   To the contrary, I refused to say anything and I pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Why did you deny it?  Why didn't you just say that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>followed a direct order from security head office, I did not doubt it at any </p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>time; I will not doubt Waal du Toit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>MR KOK:   I was accused of murder and I was part of the system in which I </p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>believed. I was part of the group who rendered technical assistance. I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>definitely not going to protect myself, not testify against my other colleagues. </p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>On three occasions the Attorney-General told me to that they were kind of </p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>going to crucify  Waal du Toit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   But you did not plan it, you were just a person, a link in </p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>the chain, connecting all the various elements.  You were probably shocked </p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>when they charged you?  Really, you acted according to a direct instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>MR KOK:   Yes, I also say that ... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Or did you know this was a big problem, this is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>problem from A to Z?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>MR KOK:   No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   And that's why you just denied everything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>MR KOK:   In the way I acted, I believed that when we are approached for </p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>assistance, the evaluation or the determination of the merits have already been </p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>done. The research had been done and the necessary investigation also. At that </p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>stage I was loyal to my commanding officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>MR KOK:   And later when Mr De Kock came there and it seems that Mr De </p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>Kock is going to tell the truth, he is going to disclose the whole matter, what </p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>MR KOK:   What can I do?  I am a victim of circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   And you go on with a lie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>MR KOK:   I never told lies. I kept quiet, I denied to say anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   You refused to tell the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>MR KOK:   That is why I am applying for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>MR KOK:   I am sorry, this is why I am applying for defeating the ends of </p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>justice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KEMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Hugo?</p>

<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BOOYENS</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>	Thank you, Mr Chairperson.  Mr Kok, I just want to ask you one </p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>question regarding the Motherwell incident itself. Can you remember at what </p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>stage Col De Kock testified? Can you remember something in this regard, </p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>after the evidence of Mr Snyman, after the re-opening of the State case ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>MR KOK:   Please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>MR BOOYENS:   During the proceedings in the Motherwell trial, where you </p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>were an accused, can you remember that Mr De Kock only later during the </p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>proceedings, gave evidence after Snyman's evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>MR KOK:   Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>MR BOOYENS:   Can you remember that order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>MR KOK:   The State reopened its case and that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>MR BOOYENS:   And you say the State reopened its case and then De Kock's </p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>evidence was presented.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a>MR KOK:   Mr Snyman was a witness right from the start.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>MR BOOYENS:   Thank you, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BOOYENS</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Jansen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a>MR JANSEN: No questions on behalf of Mr Ras, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR JANSEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>MR CORNELIUS: Cornelius for the seventh applicant, Vermeulen, I have no </p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>questions, thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR CORNELIUS</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR FORD</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>	Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Kok, briefly at page 95 of the record, </p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>page 4 of your application, it appears that in 1980 you decided to go and study </p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>theology at the University of Pretoria. Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>MR KOK:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>MR FORD:   Do you regard yourself as a religious person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>MR KOK:   I regard myself as a Christian, not a religious person. (Laughter).</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>MR FORD:   Well, then obviously it was Christianity which you were to study </p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>at the University of Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>MR KOK:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>MR FORD:   Do you know the tenth Commandment says "thou shalt not kill"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>MR KOK:   Yes, I know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>MR FORD:   At some stage, notwithstanding your religious convictions, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>Kok, you made, it appears, an election that you were not to abide by that </p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>Commandment? What made you decide that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>MR KOK:   The circumstances allowed that I could not study any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>MR FORD:   No, I think you know what my question is.  When did you decide </p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>that you were not going to abide by the Commandment which says "thou shalt </p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>not kill"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>MR KOK:   It was not a question of a specific time when I made that decision, </p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>it was a conviction I had that I was serving my country and my people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>MR FORD:   Did you realise that as your career in the police progressed, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>you were going to be required to participate in the killing of people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a>MR KOK:   I served on the border where people were killed and the struggle </p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>in which we were involved, against the previous enemy, the ANC/SACP </p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>Alliance, would cause this in the end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>MR FORD:   And you were prepared to continue with that work </p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a>notwithstanding the fact that you would be required to kill people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>MR KOK:   Yes, I did, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>MR FORD:   And when the order was given to go with Mr Du Toit to Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>Elizabeth, you were under no illusions, as you have said, but that you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>going to prepare for the killing of people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>MR KOK:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>MR FORD:   And I think we have already heard, it would, as a more junior </p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>member of the police force, it would have been difficult for you to refuse that </p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>order at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>MR KOK:   It was not a question of refusing to follow an order.  It was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>question of loyalty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a>MR FORD:   But your, what I am putting to you, Mr Kock, is that your choice </p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>came much earlier. There must have come a stage when you realised that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>were being driven into a position where you were going to be committing acts, </p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>which were not only illegal, but which were irreconcilable with your religious </p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>convictions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a>MR KOK:   It is difficult to justify, as a Christian to justify that lives are </p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>MR FORD:   You see we are not only talking of a war situation where they are </p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>shooting at you and you are shooting back at them, this is prepared execution.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>MR KOK:   With a purpose, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a>MR FORD:   And you didn't have a problem with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>MR KOK:   I didn't have a problem with that at that stage, because in the light </p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>of the struggle against us - perhaps you were not exposed to all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>circumstances and to the methods and techniques used by the opposition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>MR FORD:   May I have a moment, Mr Chairman? I have no further questions, </p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a>Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR FORD</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Just to place it in perspective, in the same Bible where it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a>stated you may not kill, there are many stories of people who are being killed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a>So it is not strange to the religion that there were also religious battles and </p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a>that people were killed in battles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>MR KOK:   The most intense wars are waged because of religion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Did you know you had to kill your colleagues?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>MR KOK:   I did not know who the targets were. They were not known. As I </p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>have already said, at the stage when it comes to my level, I accepted the </p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a>motivation and I had no grounds to question that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   It did not matter who they were, women or children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>MR KOK:   I trusted the integrity of the people who gave the order, that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>are not waging a war against women and children.  You are not interested in </p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a>whom they were, this was just purely technical support. I was not involved in </p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>the elimination. I just prepared the device. I was not involved in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>elimination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   What device?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a>MR KOK:   I just prepared the explosive device.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   But that was the device which killed the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>MR KOK:   That is correct. My part in the operation was only to prepare the </p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>device.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   But it did not bother you against whom that would be </p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>MR KOK:   I absolutely trusted Waal du Toit, and there was no reason to </p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>doubt that he will involve me without any reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   It did not matter whether innocent people were killed, </p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>you did not care, you just prepared the device. You only believed in Du Toit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a>MR KOK:   No, I believed in principles. I never acted against innocent people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Would it have made a difference if you know you prepare </p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a>this deadly explosive, to kill colleagues?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a>MR KOK:   I would still have tried - it would have made a difference, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>would have tried to view it objectively.  Different people - at the stage that it </p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a>came to my level, we had no control concerning the execution of the order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   You are referring to the methods of the so-called enemy, </p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a>how horrible they were and that was your motivation, if I understand it </p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a>correctly. That was why you to a certain degree you felt that it was justified to </p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>be involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a>MR KOK:   No, Mr Chairman, the ANC/SACP Alliance waged war against us, </p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a>and I can read a part of my application if me want to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   It is not necessary, I have read through all of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a>MR KOK:   No, the methods they used, not so much that, but they manned all </p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a>those structures and they tried to destroy them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   In this case it was not the ANC, they were colleagues in </p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>the security police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a>MR KOK:   I am repeating.  It was merely a technical support action.  One </p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>feels sorry about the loss of life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Precisely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>MR KOK:   Because I view it as something given to us by God.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>It is a pity and it is tragic that the lives of people have so little value, and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>am not referring to only us in South Africa, but the whole of the world.  What </p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a>happened in the past is a great pity and everyone of us must decide what we </p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>did with the past and what contribution we will make for the future.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Especially for you, who was interested in theology, this </p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>was important.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>MR KOK:   That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>ADV POTGIETER:   Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Brink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BRINK</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a>	Thank you, Mr Chairman, when you saw, when you were called into Du </p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>Toit's office, do I understand your evidence, it was then that he merely told </p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a>you that you were to make preparations for explosives to be put in some </p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>motorcar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>MR KOK:   He shortly explained to me what the circumstances were, not in </p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a>any detail, and he told me that I had to prepare for a specific kind of device.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>MR BRINK:  At that stage then you weren't aware that it was to be used to kill </p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>MR KOK:   No, it was an explosive device to eliminate people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a>MR BRINK:  But you didn't know who those people were at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>MR KOK:   Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>MR BRINK:   When did you learn the identity of the people that you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a>prepare the explosive for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>MR KOK:   I cannot remember a specific stage, it was after the explosion, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>I only realised who they were during the trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>MR BRINK:   I want to be quite clear on this, because it may be of some </p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>importance.  Do you say that you only knew of the identity of the people who </p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>were killed after the explosion took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>MR KOK:   Yes, I did not know them at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>MR BRINK:   You didn't know who these would be, they might not be </p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a>political activists, they could have been bank robbers or common criminals or </p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a>whatever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a>MR KOK:   I was shortly explained that they were Askaris. This was how I </p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a>can remember that independently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a>MR BRINK:   Was that after the explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a>MR KOK:   That was during the short discussion I had with Du Toit in his </p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a>office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a>MR BRINK:   So when you prepared the explosives and you were on your way </p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>to Port Elizabeth, you had no political objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a>MR KOK:   I did, he explained to me in more detail that mentioned Askaris </p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a>that had defected to the ANC or who were in the process of defecting, I can't </p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a>remember specifically, and then we discussed the technical details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a>MR BRINK:   I understood you to say you were only told about the possibility </p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a>of these being Askaris, shortly before the explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a>MR KOK:   No, I heard it during the short information session in Du Toit's </p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a>office, where he told me what to do and gave me instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a>MR BRINK:   But you were to kill Askaris, that is in effect what he told you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a>MR KOK:   He said Askaris were involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a>MR BRINK:   Did he say how they were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a>MR KOK:   I can remember that it was something concerning defecting to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a>ANC or something like that. I can't remember distinctly, because that was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a>my main motivation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a>MR BRINK:   You see, I get the impression from your evidence that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a>couldn't really have had a personal objective, you were merely following </p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a>orders from your superiors, prepare explosives, we are going to Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a>Elizabeth, we are going to blow up people.  That's all you knew. Isn't that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a>truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a>MR KOK:   If you want to put it as simplistic as that, that was what it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a>like.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a>MR BRINK:   Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BRINK</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mention of askaris was made to you before you left for Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>MR KOK:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Were you not told of members of the security branch to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a>victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>MR KOK:   I don't have an independent recollection, I can only remember the </p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a>word Askaris.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Kemp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a>RE-EXAMINATION BY MR KEMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a>	As the Committee pleases. Just two aspects, Mr Kok.  Is it correct that </p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a>you never testified at the trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a>MR KOK:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a>MR KEMP:   And secondly, what I want to ask you; at any stage before you </p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>put the bomb in the vehicle, was it explained to you why the people who had </p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a>to be eliminated like that, had to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>MR KOK:   No, never.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a>MR KEMP:   No further questions.</p>
