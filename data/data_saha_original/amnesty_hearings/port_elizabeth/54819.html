<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>NICOLAAS JOHANNES VERMEULEN:  (Duly sworn, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>EXAMINATION BY MR CORNELIUS:   Thank you, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>Chairperson.  Mr Vermeulen, you have completed an application in </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>terms of Act 34/1995 and it was handed on the 13th of December </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>and that is the application mentioned on page 160, 166 of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  As appears from page 169 you gave your full co-</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>operation to the Investigation Committee of the Truth and </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>Reconciliation Commission, the investigating team of the Attorney-</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>General's office and you also agreed to testify against your former </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>colleagues in the Motherwell Supreme Court trial. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  And as a result of your evidence inter alia a </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>conviction followed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Did you received an indemnity in terms of </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>Section 204 of the Criminal Procedure Act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Was an opportunity given to you to make further </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>representations to the honourable presiding Judge to be able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>qualify for a Section 204 indemnity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  And you haven't yet received judgment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  You have read or attached the documents and </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>records of the Supreme Court trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  The Chairperson pointed out that we should get </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>to the matter in hand very quickly. You were in the service of </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>Section C(1) of the South African Police special unit there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  And you served there from 1985 to 1992? Is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  It is common cause that in December of 1989 </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>you were summoned to the offices of Mr Eugene de Kock, who was </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>the commanding officer of the C Unit, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  And yourself, Lionel Snyman, Deon Nieuwoudt </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>and Martiens Ras were present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  What instructions or orders did you receive </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   The order which we received was to travel to </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>Port Elizabeth, to carry out a task.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  What was this task?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   The task was to in respect of members who </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>had defected and given information to the ANC/SACP, to eliminate </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>such members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Did you regard this order as a justified one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Did you regard it as being in the national </p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>interest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  It is common cause that you left there with two </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>Vlakplaas vehicles and you drove to Port Elizabeth. You and Lionel </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>Snyman in the one car and Deon Nieuwoudt and Martiens Ras as </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  What happened when you arrived in Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>Elizabeth?  Did you go to a so-called safe house and you stayed </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>there overnight. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  The next morning you and Deon Nieuwoudt and </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>the rest of your comrades travelled to a remote area outside of Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>Elizabeth. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Would you be able to identify that area again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Because I am not familiar with Port Elizabeth </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>and it would be difficult for me to point that area out again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Yes, and it has also appeared from evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>before the Commission that you were in fact misled in that all kinds </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>of circuitous routes were taken with you to mislead you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  And that is also the reason why you gave weak </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>testimony in the court, you were in fact misled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  When you arrived in the area, as appears from </p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>previous applications, there was a white Jetta car which had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>prepared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  What had been done to this car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Explosives had been placed in the boot and </p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>also in the passenger cabin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  What type of explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Use was made of commercial explosive and </p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>also military type of explosive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  And the detonator mechanism, what was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   The detonator was a radio-controlled </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>detonator.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Did you assist in the placing of the explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Were you present, should you be needed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Who actually placed the explosives in the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   It was Mr Waal du Toit and Mr Kobus Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  After the vehicle had been prepared, what </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   We then moved back to Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  That evening, along with Snyman and Ras you </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>returned to the so-called Motherwell crossing, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  After that, where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   From the crossing, Motherwell crossing, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>went to the place where the Vlakplaas vehicle had been secreted and </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>I stayed behind there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Why did you stand behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   I stayed behind to look after the vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  How far was this point from the Motherwell </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>crossing where the bomb actually exploded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   About two to three kilometres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Can you tell the Committee what happened later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   I waited at the vehicles and about 45 minutes </p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>later Mr Ras and Mr Snyman arrived there, and told me that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>operation had been successful. We then got back into our vehicles </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>and drove to Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Did you hear the sound of an explosion or see a </p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>flash?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Was too far away from that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  When you returned to Pretoria, did you report to </p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>Mr De Kock, Lieut De Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  What would have happened, Mr Vermeulen if </p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>you had not carried out Eugene de Kock's orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   If I hadn't carried out the orders, there is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>good chance that I would have lost my job and that perhaps I could </p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>have been eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Did you fear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  As the honourable Judge said you found yourself </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>in a Catch 22 situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Your loyalty would have been seriously </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>questioned if you didn't carry out the orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  And since you possessed extremely sensitive </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>information you would have posed a serious threat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  You had been involved in many operations </p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>before the Motherwell operation of '89?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Did you also operate on the need to know </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>strategy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  You were not aware of the fact that there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>ZN detonator, Soviet-origin detonator left on the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  And at that stage you were not aware of the fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>that you were deliberately misled by other colleagues, so that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>couldn't make this identification?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Mr Vermeulen, did you believe that you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>acting in the national interest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  These acts which you committed, they are </p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>obviously illegal acts, what was your political objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   My political objective was that the members </p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>who had given information to the ANC/SACP, they at that stage, </p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>they were my enemy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Did you regard these members as supporters of </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Or associates of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Did you at all times act within the normal course </p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>and scope of your duties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Did you feel that your execution of your duties </p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>had the approval of your superiors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Did you believe that any order which you carried </p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>out, was in direct compliance with the authority structure in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>security police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Did you act in a bona fide manner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Did you at all times believe that your conduct </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>was promoting the objectives of your employer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  And that it enjoyed the approval of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>employer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Even though these actions were illegal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Did you benefit personally from this Motherwell </p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Did you know the victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Did you entertain any personal malice against </p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>these victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   No, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  You are applying for amnesty, on page 179 of </p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>the application for all common law crimes and offences which may </p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>arise from the Motherwell incident, as well as conspiracy to commit </p>

<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>damages which may arise from this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Hugo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR HUGO:  	Thank you, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>Chairperson, Hugo on behalf of Mr De Kock.  Mr Vermeulen, can </p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>you recall whether Mr Nieuwoudt was present at Vlakplaas when Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>De Kock gave you the order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>MR HUGO:   Can you tell us what the precise purport was of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>motive explained to you by Mr De Kock, the motive for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   That there were members in the PE security </p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>branch who had been causing problems and that an operation had to </p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>be carried out in Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>MR HUGO:   Did Mr De Kock at any stage indicate an Askari or </p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>Askaris?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   As far as I can recall there were three people </p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>and an askari.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>MR HUGO:   Yes, but the question is; did Mr De Kock use the word </p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>Askari or Askaris when he told you about the problems these people </p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>were causing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   I can't answer that because I can't remember it </p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>well.  As far as I can recall, I am sure that the word Askari was </p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>MR HUGO:   And are you saying that Mr De Kock told you that </p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>these people were in the process of going over to the ANC or had </p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>already done so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>MR HUGO:   I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR HUGO</p>

<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Kemp?</p>

<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR KEMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>MR JANSEN VAN RENSBURG:  Mr Chairman, maybe I should just </p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>come on record to say on behalf of applicant Ras there is also no </p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR JANSEN VAN RENSBURG</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I apologise, I overlooked you, I'm </p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>sorry. Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR FORD:  	Thank you, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>Chairman, for and on behalf of Mrs Mgoduka and Mrs Faku.  Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>Vermeulen, do I understand your evidence to be that your colleagues </p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>during the preparation stages in Port Elizabeth, deliberately </p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>confused you or misled you with regard to the identities of those </p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>participating, was that the effect of your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   No, the evidence is that they misled us by not </p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>finding the proper venue where the car was prepared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>MR FORD:   I see.  So you were aware at all times of all of those </p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>involved in the preparation of the bomb in the motor vehicle, by </p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>whom the motor vehicle was brought, et cetera?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>MR FORD:   Was Mr Lotz at any stage present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   I don't know, I have never seen him at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>MR FORD:   Now you have suggested in your evidence that if you </p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>did not carry out this order, there was a real chance of you losing </p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>your work and also that you could be eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>MR FORD:   What brought you to that conclusion, Mr Vermeulen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   At that stage I was involved in lots of </p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>operations before that, and I know about a lot of sensitive </p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>MR FORD:   Now you heard Mr De Kock's evidence of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>relationship which he had with his men and which he stated quite </p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>clearly that what his attitude would have been if one of his men had </p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>felt unable to participate in a certain operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>MR FORD:   If I understood his evidence it was that it may have led </p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>to - certainly not a question of elimination of that person, he may </p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>have been less readily promoted, but there is no question of him </p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>being eliminated, just because he didn't feel capable of participating </p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>in a special operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct, it is not necessarily that </p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>elimination would have come from Mr De Kock.  The senior people </p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>higher above could have decided something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>MR FORD:   Did you ever have any reason to suspect that if you had </p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>declined to participate in this operation, Mr De Kock wouldn't just </p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>have appointed somebody else in your place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   He could have, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>MR FORD:   Were you - happy is not the appropriate word, but you </p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a>were ready to participate at all times?  Did you have any hesitation </p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>about this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   No, I didn't have any hesitations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>MR FORD:   Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   Because when I received orders from my </p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>seniors, I always tried to comply, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>MR FORD:   The point I am trying to make, Mr Vermeulen, is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>you obeyed this order, not because you were afraid of being </p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>eliminated, but because that was the way you operated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>MR FORD:   And I am putting it to you then, Mr Vermeulen, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>your suggestion that there was a real possibility of you being </p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>eliminated in these circumstances, is just not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   No, I won't say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>MR FORD:   Just give me a moment, Mr Chairman.  Thank you, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR FORD</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Brink?</p>

<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR BRINK</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Any re-examination?</p>

<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Vermeulen, you obeyed the order </p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>because you simply had no choice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  And depending on the breach of your security </p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>measures, that will depend what type of action will be taken against </p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>MR VERMEULEN:   That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>MR CORNELIUS:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR CORNELIUS</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, you may step down, Mr Vermeulen. </p>
