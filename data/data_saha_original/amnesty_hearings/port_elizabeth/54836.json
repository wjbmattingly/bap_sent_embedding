I joined them at a later stage since I had some other arrangements, personal arrangements to make.  I had to collect clothes for myself, I had to purchase food for the road and just outside Blouwater Baai, outside Port Elizabeth we stopped to eat.  When I got out of the car and looked back in the vehicle to see whether the deceased had any interest in food I noticed his right leg, I noticed that it was open and naked.  I then determined that he was only wearing underpants.\n\tI asked the members why this was the case, why he was not fully dressed and they informed me that it was very difficult to dress him since he was clumsy and stiff.  I then realised that it would be even more difficult to dress him in the back of the Land Rover.  I accept that I made no effort to dress him.  I also accept that this was inhumane.  However, I do want to mention at the same time, that there were a number of cell mats on which he was lying as well as a number of blankets and a pillow, that he was fully covered.
