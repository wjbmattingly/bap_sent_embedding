<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm going to ask you to stand to take the oath.  Can you give your full names for the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">HLUMELO MZWANE MKHULU MXUTU:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, you may sit down.  Ms Dambuza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Mr Chairman, I would like to indicate that because of the problem of communications with the applicants, no affidavits were prepared for them and therefore I shall just lead them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, that's in order, we understand the position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS DAMBUZA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>	Mr Mxutu, are you an applicant in terms of Sections 18 and 20 of Act 34/95?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> And are you applying that this Committee grants you an amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Which acts are you actually requesting amnesty in respect of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> It's that I took part in the group that was planning the coup.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> How did you become involved in this planning of the coup?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> I was involved in the planning itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Were you employed at the time this happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> I was a soldier in Ncise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> And what rank were you at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> I was a Warrant Officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Who approached you to become involved in the coup?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> It was Mr Mazizi Ntisana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> And can you relate then to the Committee what happened after Mazizi Ntisana approached you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> Mr Ntisana came to me and he told me that Col Duli wanted to see us, it would be myself and him and Mzwamadoda Ntisana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Did you then go and see Col Duli?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> Yes, we went to Col Duli.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Where did you see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> In Queenstown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> How did you get there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> There was a car from him that took us there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> What happened when you met Col Duli, what did he say to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> Col Duli said that as we knew that Ms Stella Sigcau's government was overthrown by the soldiers and these soldiers said after six months it would change and then he said that that six months had elapsed, so he wanted us to do what had happened to the previous government.  He wanted us to overthrow the military government so that the government can be returned to the people.  We agreed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Had you in fact been involved in the previous coup when the government of Ms Stella Sigcau was toppled?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> Yes, I was involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> What happened then after you agreed to participate in Col Duli's coup?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> He told us to tell the soldiers of the special forces that they should be aware of what was going to happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Yes, and what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> We indeed went to these soldiers and we told them, told certain soldiers.  After that - this coup was supposed to be on the 15th of January, if I still remember well, but a day before we heard that this plan would not succeed so we decided to abort the coup and after that, on the 15th we went to work normally and then the 16th we were arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> And were you actually subsequently convicted and sentenced in respect of this deed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> Yes, I was sentenced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> To how many years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> 8 years, 4 years suspended.  We served that sentence and then we were released after serving the sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> When were you released?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> I think it was November or December 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> When Col Duli invited you to take part in this coup, did you foresee that there would be bloodshed or even loss of life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> It was not like that, he said that it would be like the previous one, the Ms Stella Sigcau one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Are you now applying for amnesty in respect of the acts that you've outlined to the Committee just now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Mr Chairman, that is the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS DAMBUZA</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Ms Dambuza.  Mr Nodada, have you got any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NODADA:</span> One or two, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>	Mr Mxutu, did Mr Ntisana actually tell you exactly what Col Duli wanted to see you in connection with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> No, he did not tell me, he said that we would get all the details from Col Duli.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> Did you ask him any questions when he first approached you? - that is Ntisana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> I asked him and then he said that he did not know why we were needed, but he said that because we were working for Col Duli before, maybe he wanted us to do something for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> And at that time you knew that Col Duli had just been released from detention in Port Elizabeth, isn't it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> Yes, I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> Right.  Did you actually meet him in Queenstown or at Stutterheim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> In Queenstown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> Did he actually give you the details of the modus operandi that was planned for the coup?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> No, he did not give us details, he just said that on the 15th we had to wait for him, he would arrive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> And was that the only meeting that you had with him before the 15th of January?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> Yes, that was the only meeting whereby I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> Are you aware of any other subsequent meetings that were held with him before the 15th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> There's only meeting I know, it was with him, Ntisana and Bongolani Ndamase.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> And you knew that when the coup was actually implemented, the soldiers that would be involved would be armed in order to overcome the opposition which was also made up of soldiers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> The way it was said there was not going to be any bloodshed, that's what I knew, as it happened with the previous coup.  Because he said that most of the senior soldiers knew about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> And when you actually met Col Duli in Queenstown, did you ask him how the whole thing was going to be implemented?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> I didn't ask him that way, we were just asking him how he's going to do this.  He said that we must go and tell the soldiers of the special forces because they were not aware of this, so that there could not be any conflict.  He said that the officers in Ncise were aware of this, so we must not be afraid or scared of anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> And what role were you going to play in this coup, you personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> As I was his secretary before, I was going to be the one who was going to take the documents that were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> I see.  Mr Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NODADA</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Nodada.  Mr Malan, have you got any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR MALAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Mapoma?</p>

<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Would you could who you were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> It was myself, Hhlumelo, Mzwamadoda Ntisana, Bongolani Ndamase, Zandisile Bongweni and Col Craig Duli.</p>

<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MXUTU:</span> It was Col Craig Duli who was speaking to us, Mazizi Ntisana was not in that meeting, he was in another car.  It was Col Duli who told us what he had told us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Okay, thank you.</p>
