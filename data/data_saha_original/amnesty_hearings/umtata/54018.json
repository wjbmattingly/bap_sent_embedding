I phoned my brother, the deceased DM and I told him that no-one came back to me to tell me what was happening to Mlungisi and I asked him to accompany me to the camp.  When we got to the road junction there were roadblocks, we could not get into the camp in time but eventually we managed to get inside.

Rev Lila came and asked me where I was going and I told him that I was looking for Mlungisi, I wanted to know what was happening because when we went to the hospital to see the casualties we were refused.

If there was a great miscarriage of justice in the criminal matter, it is not for this Committee, with respect, to rectify the omissions in the defence by means of this forum.  \n\tIt was as early as our first consultation that I informed them of my opinion that they will not qualify for amnesty due to this fact.

            "Thank you, Mr Chairperson.  Basically, insofar as the other three applicants, that is with the exception of Mazizi Ntisana, I don't seem to be having any problems.  But my main problems actually relate to the testimony of Mazizi Ntisana, as regards the full disclosure of the relevant facts that he's required to make.\n\tIf one looks at his evidence closely, objectively as well, he wants to create an impression to this Committee that he did not know much about what was going to happen, but if one looks at his affidavit he states clearly that he had several meetings with Col Craig Duli who approached him, apparently immediately after he had been released from prison, he knew him very well, they had known each other since 1975, and he appears to be one of the persons who were aggrieved as a result of the military coup that was led by Col Duli and Bantu Holomisa, which led to the military council government in Transkei, the former Transkei.   And his dissatisfaction and grief actually emanates directly from the fact that he was a member of parliament of the civilian government that was led by Stella Sigcau and then he definitely must have involved himself in the planned coup which actually was led by Col Duli in particular, in fact it appears that he was also playing a leading role in the planning of that coup.  He gives the impression that although he had so many meetings, not only in Queenstown and East London where he fled and stayed, but also in Johannesburg and perhaps some other places.  But despite that, he has not honestly and openly told this Committee about the details of those meetings.  \n\tWe are told not only through his affidavit but also from his evidence, that he is the one who was actually sent by Col Duli to make contact with the members of the TDF at Port St Johns.  He started with his brother, Mzwamadoda Ntisana and also he made contact with other members like Ndamase, Mxutu and others that were based at Port St Johns and at the Ncise base in Umtata.  And all that is being disclosed by him is that he just told them that Col Duli wanted to see them.  And this is also repeated by the other applicants who state that they were just told that Col Duli wanted to see them, and we are not told as regards exactly the questions that they must have posed.  I mean you cannot just be called by a man that you have known to have been in detention and subsequently released through a court order, who definitely must have reached a stage where he developed some misunderstanding with his Chairman, that was Bantu Holomisa at the time, to respond to a call when you owed the allegiance that you had taken as a soldier to the military government which was ruling at the time.\n\tAnd we also hear that he actually provided transport to Stutterheim, according to him, where the meeting was with Col Duli, but he does not appear to have been involved in the deliberations in that meeting and as regards what Col Duli actually said.  He seems to be wanting to take advantage of the fact hat he was a civilian and not a soldier and therefore he could not have taken part in those discussions and he knew nothing that was being said.  Yet, he clearly informs this Committee that he was going to be the leader of the second part of the operation, that is Operation Dawn, and he had some tapes that were in his possession.  He does not tell us what was contained in those tapes and what was going to be done, save to say that he was going to meet the four paramount chiefs and also four senior chiefs that were going to take over power as soon as the coup was successful.\n\tAs regards the discussions that he had with Col Duli before they left East London on the morning of the 21st or rather, on the evening of the 21st when he was to pick up some liberation, the Lesotho Liberation Army members in Queenstown, he just skims over the events that took place.  And even as regards the communication, the constant continuous communication that he had over the radio with Col Duli, he wants to give the impression that well really there was nothing really important that was being discussed and yet that was actually the eve of the main event.  \n\tHe plays the role of - whilst admitting that he was going to be involved immediately after the coup, he wants to give the impression that he knew very, very little and he keeps on telling this Committee that whenever he has to answer a direct question which would actually cause him to disclose any relevant factors, he decides to hide behind the statement that he was dealing with a very clever man.  He kept on informing this Committee that Craig Duli was a very, very clever man and he hid most of the information from him.\n\tNow he was a member of parliament, he gives the impression that he was an active politician and was very much interested to have the power returned to the civilian government and yet he involves himself in such a serious act of high treason without exposing himself to know exactly the details and what to foresee and what to expect as to the manner in which this whole coup was going to happen.  Like for instance, as regards the involvement of the South African Defence Force he was questioned directly as to whether he knew that the SADF members were involved, he said no, he did not know. \n\tAnd he was taken further and asked whether even after the event, up to now, he has not heard that the members of the SADF were involved and when he was asked by Mr Mapoma, he denied knowledge of that until he was specifically asked by Judge Miller when he was referred to the involvement of Eugene de Kock, then he started disclosing that he had heard in the media that Eugene de Kock had supplied the arms to the people who were going to stage the coup.\n\tIf I may just go back a little bit to the members of the Lesotho Liberation Army.  He gives the impression that those people were not armed, but up to the end of his testimony we do not seem to know what their involvement was actually going to be and what role they actually played, except for conveyed in his motor vehicle from Queenstown to Maclear and Tsolo and then back to Maclear and then back to East London.  In fact he does not even say where he actually left them.",

            "Over 70, yes.  And he didn't know their names, but they were members of a liberation army and they came here to play a role, what role did they play?  They were in his motor vehicle, they were in his group, they were going to be involved in the coup, what role did they play?  That leaves a lot to be desired.  And it is my submission that when a person makes such an application, at least - although he's not required to give all the details, the Act requires that he must make a full disclosure of all relevant and material facts that will assist the Committee in coming to a decision whether the application should be granted or not.  And I submit that he has failed to do so and it is my submission that in the circumstances I'm of the view that he has not satisfied the requirements of Section 20(1)(b) of the Act, and as such I would not expect his application to be granted in those circumstances.\n\tInsofar as the other applicants, as I've indicated, it would appear that they were soldiers and apparently they were hand-picked.  I'm not sure about Ntisana, whether he was hand-picked by his brother or it was the choice of Col Duli, I'm not very sure there, but according to the evidence of Mazizi Ntisana he approached them.  And also the evidence of Mzwabantu(?) Ntisana, his brother himself, he was just approached and told that he was wanted by Col Duli, he wanted to see him.  The same applies to Mxutu and Bongweni.  \n\tAnd without asking questions, without really wanting to know about what was going to happen, they give the impression that they just got up and went to see Col Duli and when they got there Col Duli told them that he was going to take over and that he had already made contact with his senior officers, they were aware of this and they were ready to assist him, and then they were sent to go to the special forces at Port St Johns just tell them that this is what was going to happen.\n\tAnd those members, those applicants were members of the TDF and they were employed full-time, like we have heard from Mxutu that they were arrested on the day they were going to work.  I also feel that really although their case is not, insofar as I'm concerned, as bad as that of Mazizi Ntisana, there is a lot that they have not disclosed to this Committee and all the attempts have been made to extract the information from them and this unfortunately has been in vain.\n\tI also submit therefore that there is not much that has been presented by these persons, that is the other three applicants, that would make them qualify for the application that they are making.

            "Chairperson, I just have very few points in respect Mr Mazizi Ntisana's application, as some of the issues Chairperson, have been covered by my learned colleague, Mr Nodada, regarding his application.\n\tChairperson, I have got some concerns regarding the requirement of full disclosure as well when it comes to the application of Mr Ntisana.  It will be recalled Chairperson, that Mr Mazizi Ntisana was a member of parliament prior to the overthrowing by Gen Holomisa and in fact he was a businessman in Transkei.  One of the reasons why this government was toppled by Gen Holomisa it's a matter of public record, were accusations of corruption and nepotism.  He was a personal friend of Mr Craig Duli for a number of years.  In fact in paragraph number 4 on page 61 of the bundle he says -\n\"During 1988 I was taken into custody for a period of three weeks, due to the fact that I dare to question the government of Gen Holomisa.\"\n\tThis shows that immediately after Holomisa came into power he had his own problems with that government and has never been satisfied with it.  And he goes on to criticise the Holomisa government and he says on page 62 of the bundle -\n\"I was convinced that the coup d'etat was the only avenue left to get rid of Holomisa and to force him to hand over power and authority back to the Transkei people in order to establish a democratic government.\"\nI leave it there. \n\tChairperson, this I would submit gives an impression that we are dealing with a man who all along, after Holomisa came into power, became convinced that the only solution is to get him off power through a coup d'etat.  Now he meets with Mr Duli after his release from prison, he gets conversation with him to the extent that he is sent to call some soldiers.  Interestingly enough there Chairperson, he pleads that he is ignorant of what the plan is.  And I submit Chairperson, this is highly inconceivable, that at that stage during January, we are dealing with a man who did not know what these soldiers were wanted for by Mr Craig Duli.  And that is important Chairperson, a disclosure to be made because it impacts on his role in the planning of this coup d'etat.  It impacts as well on his role in the actual coup itself.",

I've got a feeling Chairperson, I would submit, that he has not been candid enough before the Committee to give as complete a picture as possible of what their plan was in this coup.  It is not enough Chairperson, I would submit, to say that because he was to be involved in Operation Dawn and not Operation Sacrifice as such, that would mean that he did not know at all what Operation Sacrifice would entail.

And therefore, even though he does not align himself with the coup of the 16th January or 15th January, the planned one, it is my submission that the background that he has given, there are no flaws of significance that can be cause enough for the application not to be granted in his favour.",

Mr Mazizi Ntisana does not say - his evidence does not indicate that he became agitated or dissatisfied with Holomisa's government immediately after he took power, he said the agreement or the understanding was that he was going to take power for six months and thereafter he would release the power back to the people.  \n\tNow in paragraph 4 he does indicate that what happened is that the corruption that was present on Ms Stella Sigcau's government escalated and it, I submit, was sufficient ground for him at this stage to think that if we let this go on and on, things are going to get only worse.
