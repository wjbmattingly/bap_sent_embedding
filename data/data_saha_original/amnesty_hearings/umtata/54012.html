<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Ntisana, do you hear the interpretation?  Will you please stand to take the oath.  Are your full names Sidwell Mzwamadoda Ntisana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">SIDWELL MZWAMADODA NTISANA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, you can sit down.  Yes, Ms Dambuza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS DAMBUZA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>	Mr Ntisana, is it correct that you are an applicant in terms of Sections 18 and 20 of Act 34/95?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Is it correct that you are a brother to Mazizi Thomas Ntisana who has just testified before the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Yes, he is my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> And is it correct that you have deposed to an affidavit on the 2nd day of November 1999, in support of your application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Is it correct that until 1991 you were employed by the Transkei Defence Force as a Sergeant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> From 1976 up until the period when I was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Is it correct that in January 1990, whilst you were employed in the Transkei Defence Force you were approached by your brother Mazizi Ntisana, who informed you that the late Col Craig Duli wanted to see you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Did he tell you - that is your brother, did he tell you what Col Craig Duli wanted to see you for?  If so, can you tell the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> He never mentioned to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Did you know Col Duli before this day, before your brother approached you as you've already said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> I used to know him because I was working with him in the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Who were you with when you went to see Col Duli as requested by your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> I was with Hlumelo Mxutu, Sandisile Bongweni and Bongo Ndamase.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Where did you meet Col Duli?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> In Stutterheim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> How did you get there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> We requested my elder brother to take us there because we did not have transport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Are you referring to your brother, Mazizi Ntisane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> When you met Col Duli in Stutterheim, what did he tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> He told us that he was released from prison and he had decided to take over the Holomisa government by the soldiers, so that the government could go back to the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Did he tell you why the government had to be returned to the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> There was a time-frame that had elapsed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> What was your response then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> We agreed to what he was saying and we did as he told us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> What exactly did he tell you to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> He told us to try and recruit in Port St Johns, recruit the special forces and explain his intentions.  That was agreed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Did you at that time believe that Col Duli's intentions were justified in trying to take the government back to the people of Transkei?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> As I was working with him he was the ringleader of the people in a coup d'etat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Which other coup d'etat was he a leader of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Coup d'etat of Nkosazana Stella's government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Were you involved in that coup?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> As a person who was working for the Military Intelligence and he was a leader there, I was also amongst those people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Pursuant then to the request by Col Duli to recruit other members, who did you approach and what did you say to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> In Port St Johns we met with Xweta Ndeleni, Zamikaia Armens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> What were their ranks at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> They were Warrant Officers but from different companies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Did they agree to participate in the intended coup?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> When was this intended coup supposed to take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> On the 15th January 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Did it in fact take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Why, if you know, did it not take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> It became apparent that there was some misunderstanding in Port St Johns and the information leaked and when we got to Umtata on the 14th of January, we were told that everything that we were intending to do was well known.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> What then did you do when you discovered that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> What we did on the 15th, we woke up, we went to work and got our cheques and we went to our homes and we had told ourselves that we are not going to go ahead with this plan because it was rather dangerous.  On the 16th we went to the offices and we were arrested on the 16th of January 1990, in our offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Is it correct then that you were then detained for almost two years and ultimately charged with conspiracy to commit treason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Is it correct that you were convicted and sentenced to 8 years imprisonment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> How many years did you serve in prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> I was sentenced in 1990 up until 1994, December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Are you now applying for amnesty for your acts as you have just outlined to the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Yes, that is correct, because what is more important is to get my fingerprints, the criminal record against my name be removed as a person who was found guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MS DAMBUZA:</span> Mr Chairman, that is the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS DAMBUZA</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Ma'am.  Mr Nodada, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NODADA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>	Now how many were you as members of the Transkei Defence Force stationed at Port St Johns, who were involved in this conspiracy to overthrow the government of the military council at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Four of us from Umtata, the other two were from Port St Johns.  Those were the people that we were to talk to in Port St Johns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> So you were based at the Ncise base in Umtata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Yes, I was here in Ncise, Umtata.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> And you were the only four members who knew about this coup, at the Ncise base?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Only the two of us from Ncise and the other two from Port St Johns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> So all-in-all you were six members of the TDF that were in favour of this take-over by Col Duli?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Six of us knew about the plan, but we were not going to face any problems when we meet the whole of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> When you meet the whole of you, what do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> We would meet with Port St Johns and the people from Ncise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> Who actually fixed the 15th of January 1990 as the date of the take-over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> It was Col Duli.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> And when was your first visit?  That is the day when Mazizi Ntisana took you from here to Stutterheim to meet Col Duli, what date was that? - if you can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> It was the 7th of January 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> So that was your first meeting with Col Duli for the intended coup?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Yes, I just saw him for the first time after he was released from prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> And a week thereafter was the intended date to actually give effect to that intention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Please repeat the question, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> You met on the 7th of January 1990, and that was your first meeting and the beginning of the planning according to you, and the actual coup was going to be staged on the 15th of January, that is a week from the date of your first meeting with Col Duli.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> Was it hoped that within that short space of time you would have successfully mobilised other members of the Transkei Defence Force to welcome and assist Col Duli in the take-over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> He had told us that there were senior officers that he had already talked to, therefore we had to be there on that particular day to recruit Port St Johns, because he never got a chance to talk to the group from Port St Johns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> Is it correct that you subsequently established that there were no such senior officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> We realised that on the 14th, when we heard that we are going to be arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> As you were a member of the Transkei Defence Force based in Umtata, did you get the feeling that the bulk if not the entire TDF, was in favour of -or rather, was not happy with the ruling of the military council?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> I cannot say for sure because we were based on different sections at work, some people had their own opinions, different from the others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> Where were you when the aborted coup was staged on the 22nd of November 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> I was in Mount Ayliff in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> You were already in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> I was arrested on the 16th January 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> Had you already been tried and convicted when you were at Mount Ayliff Prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> Not yet.  And you as a person and a member of the TDF then, you cannot say to this Committee that Col Duli had the full support of the Transkei Defence Force when he wanted to take over the Transkei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> May the speaker please repeat the question, there was a slight problem with the headset.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> Alright, thank you.  You personally, you cannot say from your personal knowledge, that Col Duli when he planned to stage a coup in Transkei, had the full support of the members of the Transkei Defence Force of the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> I can say he had a full support from the TDF members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> On what basis are you saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> I saw that from the first coup when he was overthrowing Stella and there was no resistance from the soldiers and even when the Mzimwusi ...(indistinct) was resigning, there was no opposition or resistance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> Now when he actually staged the aborted coup on the 22nd November 1990, were there any members of the Transkei Defence Force that supported him, to your knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> No, I do not know because when this happened I was already in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> And you heard that his forces that came with him to Umtata, when they got to the Ncise base, they attacked one of the camps and the camp that they attacked was mainly made up of recruits and that is where they had most of their casualties.  Are you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> I heard that through the media.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> You heard that.  And certainly you will agree with me that if there was any support from the Ncise military base, there would have been no point for Craig Duli and his followers to first attack that base when they arrived in Umtata? - instead of coming straight to where the military council was seated at ...(indistinct).  If they had the full support of the TDF.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> I cannot respond to that because at the time I was in detention, I had been there for quite a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> Yes, but subsequently you were released from detention and you heard how the whole thing happened, isn't it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Yes, I heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> Does it not surprise you that their first target was the military base in Umtata, if he had the full support of the members of the TDF?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> When I got out of jail that was no longer in my mind because I had been in detention for a very long time, suffering, I couldn't see my wife and my children and my parents and then I decided to disassociate myself from all those and attend to my domestic problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> Apart from Craig Duli's involvement in the 1987 coup which culminated in the military council ruling this country, what other reason did you have or can you give for concluding that during this second attempt by Craig Duli, he had the full support of the members of the Transkei Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> It is because of his utterances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> Is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTISANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR NODADA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NODADA</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Nodada.  Mr Malan, questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No questions, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR MALAN</p>
