Then when she was in Engangaliswe, she only - she was sick and always at Engangaliswe they used to phone your offices at Norwood but you wouldn't come to fetch her because she complained she was sick and then it was only on the fourth day that she was fetched, not by you this time, by two other people she doesn't know who were part of the assaulting team.

We have been here in this part of the Eastern Cape.  We always wondered why it looks like there's not be any atrocities reported in this area and we felt hurt that no one was prepared to come up.  Now that Mr Siqhola has come up we say we are very encouraged by the decision that he has taken.\n\tWe also want to put on record, that is this sitting here, we know there are a lot of others who were involved.  We see some of them sitting here.  We have taken note of their reflection of events.  We know for a fact that they were directly involved, we see them here, we can quote their names.  They know.  We know that Capt Siqhola was not the only one who committed atrocities.  We wish to express our disappointment to this Commission that there are still people who are sitting here and still prepared to hide what happened in this part of our country. \n\tTo the Commission we want to say that if Mr Siqhola qualifies for amnesty in terms of the requirements of the law, we as victims have got no problems with that.  As we said earlier on that we are encouraged by the decision that he alone has taken.  I do not know what the other members of the then Transkei security are prepared to do but we're saying we know as well as they do that they committed atrocities and we're saying we wonder as to whether they are prepared to extend their hand of friendship to us.\n\tAnd lastly to Mr Siqhola, we're saying we hope from now we will be able to put the past behind us and we hope again we'll be able to interact as there are many, many other issues that we still want information about with one of our own friends who died.  Mention was made here of Solly Present, who to some of us as a friend.  Gift Maqekeza, a number of them who up to date would not know what happened to them.  We still hope that we'll be able to interact with you and be able to get to understand some of the issues that happened.

            "Yes, thank you Chairperson and Honourable Members of the Committee.\n\tThe main issue at this stage is whether the applicant through his evidence which was tested at length by cross-examination qualifies for amnesty in terms of the Act and the tried points which are embodies in the legislation we are dealing with here, Mr Chairperson, one is whether the killing was motivated by political objective and secondly, whether he was disclosed all the facts fully for purposes of qualifying for an amnesty and thirdly, whether the gravity of the offences he committed are commensurate with the objective which he aspired to achieve.\n\tFirstly, our submission Mr Chairperson, is that there is profound evidence to prove that the deeds were motivated by a political objective and we submit that, with all respect, we would be astounded if there is any legal representative here who gainsays that there was a political objective for all the offences committed by the applicant.\n\tSecondly, the aspect which I would like to highlight and which forms the crux of all evidence led before this court, only the applicant has testified under oath and submitted himself to extensive cross-examination and at times very tedious and laborious.  Applicant remained unexhausted throughout and was consistent and his answers were compelling in all material aspects.  I admit that there were certain discrepancies in his evidence but with due respect, Mr Chairperson, one should understand the lapse of time which was a dominating factor throughout his evidence.\n\tHis testimony or his demeanour was quite impressive and his testimony was straightforward and consistent as well.  I'm not in a position to highlight any material discrepancy which, Chairperson and Honourable Members, would find against the applicant.\n\tThirdly, Honourable Committee, out of the solo testimony which has been examined extensively by this Committee, through legal representatives, one, the senior members of his security branch, despite their presence, elected not to give any evidence.  I accept that they were not the applicants but they elected not to give evidence and made the evidence of the applicant in these proceedings much more stronger and secondly, the victims did not give evidence in these proceedings.  I do not say at all that the victims avoided to be cross-examined, I don't say that at all but what I'm saying is that by a process of evaluation of evidence before this Committee, there is only the version of the applicant and it is for this Committee to decide whether the applicant has given a compelling version of the events.  I take note of certain statements which are contained in the bundle which was used in the proceedings, statements made by each victim and most of issues raised by each victim in his or her statement were admitted by the applicant is of no point to say that the applicant has not disclosed the truth if you compare his version with that statements.\n\tThere are a few aspects where there will be mention of a particular victim being treated in a different way but the applicant has conceded and taken full responsibility of whatever atrocities took place whilst he was a member of a security branch.  To make an example, there has been a detailed cross-examination of the plight of Mrs Matoti and the applicant has unequivocally taken full responsibility for what happened to Mrs Matoti.\n\tAnd again I reiterate, Mr Chairperson, that the applicant here has said more than three times that no one persuaded him to come and apologise to the victims and apply for amnesty.  He voluntarily took the risk of coming before this Committee and endeavoured by all possible means to tell the truth.  \n\tGoing further, Mr Chairperson, the applicant voluntarily explained his empty-headedness regarding his role as member of the security police.  He grew up in rural areas without any political environment for him to acquire the positive political education.  He had a rudimentary education, that is passed only Standard 10 in rural areas of Gumbu and his pathetic - if I can put it in the stronger terms, his pathetic position politically was aggravated by the security policemen who indoctrinated them.  This Committee, we submit, should accept that the applicant was indoctrinated more especially that not a single senior policeman came here to rebut his version.  Instead all of them elected to listen to the evidence and through their attorneys put questions to convey a bad denial on each on every material aspect which the applicant was addressing for the purposes of this application.\n\tMr Chairperson, at the time the applicant got his indoctrination at the hands of the security police he was only 21 years having been born in 1959 according to official application form for amnesty.  It's not a question where a senior policemen would sanction or give instructions to juniors to assault people.  Here we are talking about an ordinary junior constable who occupied that rank throughout and had a limited authority to exercise a discretion as to what to do in the circumstances because of the provisions of the ...(indistinct) Act which was applicable then and the Act itself states out clearly that only a commissioned officer would authorise the arrest of a detainee.  He went further in his testimony to explain his plight, that is his purpose there was only to accept orders from his seniors and he actually understood that assault and torture of detainees was the culture of the security branch in Transkei and he understood that as an semi-educated person the only way of extracting evidence from detainees was to assault them and this was achieved because for example when Dugard Maqageza was assaulted he revealed that there were so-called terrorists in Willowvale. \n\tOur submission, Mr Chairperson and Honourable Members, is that there has been full disclosure and again I'll reiterate that the fact - the issues of details which my colleagues, particularly Mr Mgidlana, concentrated on time and again, are issues which at that stage are completely relevant, with due respect, because it doesn't matter whatever form of torture was used by the applicant to each and every detainee, the applicant has unequivocally accepted full responsibility for his conduct.  Whether there was cigarette burns used in the body of a particular detainee, water poured or whatever, he has taken full responsibility of whatever damage caused to each detainee and again I want to ask the Committee when assessing his evidence to apply it's mind fully to the question of lapse of time which seemed at times to confuse the applicant but despite that the applicant was ready to admit if he was not in a position to remember certain events.  He was ready to concede where it was necessary to concede.  I'm not at all saying that he presented here a perfect testimony, it was a testimony which there were at times certain mistakes which he committed but on the whole it was a formidable and a detailed account presented by the only security policeman in the Transkei who has voluntarily decided to come and tell the truth.\n\tNow I don't want, Mr Chairperson, to give details of what he said about Mr Nyoka, Mr Mtimkulu, Magwentshu, Ms Matoti and Ntshikilana, etc.  The fact of the matter without being repetitive, the fact of the matter, whatever one says as a victim he has taken full responsibility for his wrongful acts.

            "Thank you Chairperson.  I think Mr Mtimkulu has put clearly the attitude of the victims which is to the effect that if the applicant qualifies to be granted amnesty in terms of the requirements of the Act they will have no quarrels with that.  I would have hoped therefore that in his address the representative of the applicant will be mindful of that and I hope that those who were the victims who seem to be the only ones that are prepared to extend a hand of reconciliation are not going to feel bad out of some submissions that have been made on behalf of the applicant which, with respect, I think some of them have got an element of arrogance in them.  But be that as it may, it is not for the victims to come and give evidence, to try and show that the applicant has not told the whole truth and subject themselves to cross-examination.  We had avoided that purposely because we did not want the situation wherein it will turn out into a fight between the applicant because from the very word go it became clear that the victims were interested in the telling of the truth.  I must say that during the testimony of the applicant I had a feeling which feeling I must say it was not my personal feeling but out of interacting with the victims, they were not satisfied at the level to which the applicant was prepared to tell the truth.  Of course I'm heartened because towards the end of the hearing during the cross-examination by the legal representative of the Police, the implicated members of the Police, it was then that it seemed that he was now loosening up and willing to fill in the gaps that we would have thought that he will be prepared to fill in earlier on and it is my submission that it is on that basis that there has been also this feeling amongst those that I represent that if for whatever reason he qualifies then he shall be granted amnesty.\n\tOne could go on length in addressing the question whether or not he has satisfied the requirement insofar as a full disclosure but I would like again to be brought in the same trap of trying to down play what has been said by Mr Mtimkulu on behalf of the victims.  I will rather leave it at that for as long as it is taken note of course we are disappointed by some of the arrogant submissions that have been made on behalf of the applicant.  However, we wouldn't like to deal with them because it will just change the complexion of the attitude of those who are the victims.  Thank you.",

She wants me to mention that out of expediency she was to speed up the proceedings, she did not want to delay them and simply out of that fact this is the reason why she did not want to testify and she wants that to be taken note because she wanted to explain in detail what happened.\n\tThe other factor is that she would rather leave this whole issue to be decided by the Committee and she also wants me to recall that the victim, shortly before we made this or resumed the adjournment, she came to her and apologised for everything and when confronted about the lack of trust she said she did not, she had forgotten, but the problem with that is that she did not admit it whilst she was being cross-examined.

            "Yes Mr Chairperson.  Mr Chairperson, throughout the cross-examination that I conducted it has transpired that more specifically with the incident at Willowvale that the applicant cannot say unequivocally who gave the instructions on that day to destroy property and to shoot but what I submit what he wants this Commission to find is to assume as he claims that that was a security branch operation.  To assume that, therefore, because all the other forces that were there had gone to assist the security branch.  The security branch's senior officers who were there and even those who remained here in Umtata are the ones who gave orders whilst he has admitted that he cannot say who gave orders when the bombing occurred, he was behind in the forest.\n\tFurthermore, it's also my submission that even regarding these other instances where people were tortured, assaulted and ill-treated, he cannot say that it's General so and so or so and so said I must assault so and so.  He specifically told this Committee that what he did to the people that he had encounters with was what he copied, was what he saw, that was what was being done to suspects by the members of the security branch.  In other words, nobody specifically said you must assault suspects, you must torture suspects, you must ill-treat suspects.  He says it himself that he did what he saw being done there, there were no specific orders and he keeps on all along to say he, as a junior officer, non-commissioned, he could not have signed a warrant either for arrest or detention.  We have no problem with that.  Nor can it be said that the gentlemen, the handful of them, the top management of the security branch that he had mentioned in his application are the ones who signed the warrants of arrest and detention because we are told that the only person or people who have powers to sign warrants of arrest or warrants of detentions are any members of the security branch, that is commissioned members.  Any commissioned member of the security branch could authorise that so and so be arrested, so and so be detained, it's not as if it was clear cut that only the top management of the security branch would authorise warrants of arrest and warrants of detentions.  Hence it's the submission of my clients that they did not know that when those warrants of arrests and detentions were signed and handed over to the applicant and others were attached to the investigative unit of the security branch.  Suspects that were arrested and later detained were thereafter subjected to the type of treatment, torture, assault that the applicant has described before this Committee, nor did they sanction that they be treated in that manner.  It is therefore my submission that the warrants of detention and arrest were issued to applicants did not authorise applicant to carry the deeds that he carried out.\n\tI'm further submitting, Chairperson, that the operation, the joint operation, that occurred at Willowvale, it's not clear to be honest.  I've been listening throughout the proceedings.  It's not clear, it cannot be clearly said that so and so was in command of this operation.  Can it be said that someone from Pretoria or someone from TDF or someone from security office branch was in charge of the operation?  That's all Mr Chairperson.",

I have not heard submissions being made in respect of that particular activity.  I am saying this, Chairperson, because the political objective which was intended to be achieved by going to the Jafta's homestead was to apprehend persons who were perceived or who were referred to as terrorists and upon arrival there the incident took place.

He did not refer to the security branch from Transkei at all and then he boldly says that \"I was part of that operation.\"  \t\n\tChairperson, it is my submission that that is not sufficient for him to be claiming responsibility for that or to be found liable for that and under cross-examination, Chairperson, he was even asked why was the house burned down and the shop.

He went on, Chairperson, to say that the house was burned down after Boy Jafta was already apprehended.  That is his evidence.

My point is that in considering this application, the Committee at the end of the day will have to decide whether he has made a full disclosure of his role as a security policeman and that was an endeavour to avoid hiding some pieces of evidence because if he were to be asked by any of legal representatives of the victims of the policemen here about his role as a security policeman at the premises of Mr Jafta, he would have been exposed as somebody who was not honest to the Commission. \n\tBut be that as it may, I must reiterate, Mr Chairperson, I'm in no way pursuing, I mean arguing that it was correct for the police to destroy the house of Jafta family, I'm not at \nall.",

You see the problem as I see it as Mr Mapoma is putting it is that your client is a constable and as such he is applying for amnesty pursuant to section 22(b) as an employee of the State or any former State or a member of that State's security forces.  Now for there to be a political objective it's got to be against a known political organisation, liberation movement engaged in the political struggle.  Now if there is no political objective then the act, no matter how he might have thought it was, can never be something that amnesty can be granted?",

It would be irresponsible for me as representative of the applicant to cause damage to the moving speech made by Mr Mtimkulu before this Committee.  It is true that the applicant is extending a hand of reconciliation hence that he has volunteered to appear before the Commission.  There is, with respect, no element of arguments at all on the part of the applicant.  I may indicate that there seems to be a misunderstanding when I indicated earlier on that the victims did not give evidence.  That is true but I was putting this in the context of evaluation of evidence before the Commission.  Not because I was saying that the victims are to be blamed.",
