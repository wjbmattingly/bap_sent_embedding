This was on a Monday in 1986, if I'm not mistaken the date was the 13th of March.\n And he came back on time for lunch, and that was at 11 o'clock.  He came home out of breath and you could see that he was running.\n When he came home, he said that he was in a hurry, because the teachers were in a meeting and had released them from class late, so he was very in a hurry.\n He took bread and milk from the table and just had two bites and ran out with bread still in his hand.\n I think not even 15 minutes after that, I heard a shot.  But I did not pay attention as to what it was all about, because they were busy fixing roads at that stage.\n Not long after that there was an even louder shot.  I came out, when I came out of the door Spokazi was coming in \nQUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n2 NNE PLAATJIE\nby the gate, crying and she said to me, Ma Luthando, Luthando.\n I tried pacifying her thinking that she was crying because she was running and she had left him behind, but then I saw the school children coming up the road, coming running up the road, crying.\n Some had their hands on their heads, some were saying it is Tiki, it is it Tiki, Oh, my God, it is Tiki.  I did not know who this Tiki was, or because I didn't know this name.\n But they were just saying Oh, Tiki.\n But coming up my road, in stead of passing my house, they came to my house and one of them said is it Plaatjie and from the back said, yes it was Luthando.\n And others started running to this place where he got hurt.",

Before I even got there, the police, White policemen were there at U9, where he had passed by a friend's house.\n They were standing there with their guns in their hands.  And I made my way through the crowd since it was full.  I got there and he was laying on his stomach with his QUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 NNE PLAATJIE\nhead of his arms, bleeding through his ears and through his nostrils.\n That was the last time I was at my full senses.  After that I just found myself at home, I must have fainted in the interim.\n When I came to I was hysterical, I was crying, I wanted to go out of the windows to my child in the hospital.  The police had taken him to hospital themselves.\n The following day we went to look, we went to the police and there we were asked whether we knew which police had shot him and we did not know.\n We were sent to the State mortuary to look for him.

When they were\nQUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n5 NNE PLAATJIE\n arrested there was, nothing much came of it because we had already given up by then, because it was 1987 or 1988 by then.\n An attorney from Cape Town came after lunch on a Wednesday, and was looking for the Plaatjie family.  My husband was at home then because it was his day off, he was working at a butchery and fortunately he was in.\n This attorney wanted to know how we were related to Luthando and we said that we were his family.  He said that he was there for the trial in the killing of Luthando.\n He gave us a lift in his car, wanting to know if the place where he was shot, was far and asked us to show him where Luthando had been shot.\n This attorney looked at this place and once again we got into the car with him and he brought us back and the following day he came to fetch us and took us to court.\n When we got to court they proceeded with the case in a private court.  And the trial was conducted by a few people.\n During the trial it became apparent that these police are becoming nervous because this attorney has them under cross-examination and he seems to be succeeding.\n We were very happy in our hearts that this attorney was succeeding.  But then the Magistrate said that he would like the court to adjourn, for them to meet outside.\n The Magistrate and the Prosecutor and these two policemen then went out into the passage and we don't know what they said in the passage, but when they came back inside, they said that they apologised because that happened by mistake.\n Because those policemen had not shot at Luthando.  Luthando was a man standing next to a house.  I suppose it \nQUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n6 NNE PLAATJIE\nmeans that he was just a rubbish that was standing there.  \n It seems as if the police were shooting at a man that they had been looking for for a while, who had run away from Cape Town with dagga and they were chasing this man and had shot Luthando by mistake, not knowing that it was a school child that was going to school.\n But Luthando was wearing a school uniform and he was on his way to school, he had on a white shirt, a grey pants, green socks, green and white socks, black shoes.
