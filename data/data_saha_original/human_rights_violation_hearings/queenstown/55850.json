            "Boniswa Oliphant, we thank you for the story which has become somewhat familiar to us people that were living in this area during the time when we were under a very corrupt Government of the Ciskei.\n The way in which you have spoken speaks to our consciences.  When the Headmen system was imposed and the way in which this led to the killing of many people in the then Ciskei homeland.\n When we leave from here we are going to have a hearing at Bisho where we are going to be sitting especially for the things that happened during the Bisho massacre, as well as other related issues, issues related to the Bisho massacre.\n We hope that people who were in Government, soldiers, policemen who were in positions during the time of Brigadier Oupa Gqozo will come forward and give us a picture of things that happened then.\n You have already asked us to forward this question that you want to know exactly, you want to know all the details surrounding Welile's death, your husband's death.\n We sympathise with what you have told us, we thank you for it and we thank you for the courage you have shown and also the time in which your husband passed away, which must have been a very painful time for you.\n I trust that the Commission has gathered information while you were talking and also about the children who had been left behind, the Commission who will submit, make submissions to the President, I am sure that they will pursue this issue and see if anything can be done for you and your children in terms of what the President will say to this request and we would like to thank you now and ask you\nQUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n12\n to take up your seat once more.  Thank you very much.",
