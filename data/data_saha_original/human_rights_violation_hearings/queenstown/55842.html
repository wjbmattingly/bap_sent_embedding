<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you very much.  I was just a bit worried that these times had changed women to men.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> I have found that Ester Madolo is unable to come and testify personally before the Commission, and she has asked that you testify on her behalf.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Thank you very much sir.  We would like to welcome you and we would like to give over to Ntsikelelo Sandi and let him lead you in your evidence on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  You said that your name was Patrick Madolo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You came to give evidence on behalf of Esther Madolo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> I came on behalf of my parents, because they couldn't come because of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You are going to testify about what happened on the 28th of October 1989.  What happened to Pasika Madolo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What was Pasika Madolo to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> He was my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Can you please tell us what you know to have happened to your brother on this day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>QUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>2 P MADOLO</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> Yes, I can tell you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Please tell us, Patrick.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> This whole thing happened as a result of the unrest that started at school and when this happened, my brother was away at school.  He was at school in Lady Frere.  He had come back the Friday to come and get groceries and he came at the time when the police were shooting in our street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a> And it was something that had started back at the school.  I had gone to work after six on that day and had left them in the yard at home. </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a> Apparently there was a meeting at school on that day.  The meeting had come out already, because he had come by bus after five.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you know if the meeting - what the meeting was all about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> The meeting was about - for the parents and the children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What were they going to talk about at this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> They were going to talk about the cause of this unrest at the school because apparently some people were taking the law into their own hands.  And the cause of this unrest was that one of the ladies on the Board had - there was conflict between her child who was a student there and in this conflict her child was beaten and she went onto the premises and hit the child that had assaulted her child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a> So on that Friday there was a meeting for the parents who were complaining about Board members who were taking the law into their own hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were they not going to discuss a student that had</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>QUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>3 P MADOLO</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>been shot by the police at this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> There was a student that had been shot at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Who was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> I cannot remember if it Mulelo Beger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Where was Pasika shot?  Where exactly at Indwe was Pasika shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> He was shot in the location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Would you be able to elaborate on the manner in which he was shot and by whom he was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> According to information we received, since the police had shot that Friday night and did not want anybody walking around the streets, he had left home and walked halfway with a friend of his from school and the following day, at approximately past six when I came back from work, when I was going to undress and get ready for bed, I heard a scream from the kitchen side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a> When I jumped to see what was happening, another cousin of mine was explaining that she thought it was Pasika who had been shot and had been locked up in another house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a> I hurriedly, while my father was still going to get dressed, I ran to this house.  This was Maqonge's house.  When I got to this house, there was room in which the boys stayed and it was closed up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a> When I opened it, he was laying there and he was finished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Whose house was this in which he was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> This was Maqonge's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Can we please keep quiet, this is the last witness.  We had shown respect to all the other witnesses.  Can we please do the same with this one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>QUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>4 P MADOLO</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> And one man came there, this is the man that had seen him.  When I asked what had happened here, he said that he had also been looking out for his children and he just found Pasika's corpse laying on the ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a> When I opened him up to see where the damage was, I did not see any wounds in front and when I looked at his back, there was probably some sort of punishment that they had inflicted upon him and there was a wound which was sustained on his left and that is what I saw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a> And this man then continued to explain that now this child, according to what he had heard, this is something that happened the previous day at about six o'clock.  It became apparent that after he had been shot, he ran to a nearby house and that lady there, was not fair because she - when she saw that his strength was fading, she chased him away and said go, go, go.  I don't want the police to come into my house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a> So it became apparent that there were people that dragged him when they saw that his strength was fading and put him into this house and this is where we found him dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> ; If I understand you correctly, you are saying that Pasika and them were being chased by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> I am trying to say that a group was being chased, because I am not too clear on what happened with him, but they say that he went into this house and that the gang that was being chased by the police, found him along the way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a> Apparently he was weak already and they dragged him into this house, into this room and this is where we found him, dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is there anyone that, is there perhaps an eyewitness to all this without saying that what you are</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>QUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>5 P MADOLO</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>saying is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> There are people but it is difficult for them to come forward and say exactly what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Pasika was then buried at home.  Were there any conditions laid down by the police in connection with how the funeral should be conducted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> No, there were no restrictions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were there any incidents on the day of the burial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> No, they co-operated with us, because they closed the road so that the funeral procession could continue unhindered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Was there any case that followed his murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> No, we waited for something to happen after the post-mortem, but nothing happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> The attorney that your family went to, did you say, who did you say it was again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> I cannot get his name precisely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Was it not Mr Roshen Dehal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> I am not sure, but there were steps that were taken.  I wasn't at home that much during that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Your mom says in her statement that nothing became of the case.  Did the attorney give you any reason for this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is that all you have to say?  Is that your testimony?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> Yes, that is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did your mom or are you - what do you want the Commission, or what does your Mother want the Commission to do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> When we discussed this, we found that an investigation can be conducted even though the investigation QUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>6 P MADOLO</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>will not bring him back to life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a> Because when he died, he was in standard 9, so this will not bring him back for us to see him again.  That is one of the reasons why my parents just gave up and didn't, couldn't come here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is that all you want to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Can I hand you back to the Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> Yes, you may.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you very much, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> I am now going to ask - can we please keep quiet.  Thank you very much.  I am going to ask Revd Xundu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Was your mother's health affected by this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> My mom got very sick, so much so that she suffers from her heart, a heart complaint and my father was still working when he also got sick and he had to stop working because he is a diabetic and he has high blood pressure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> How do they survive.  Do they receive any pensions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">P MADOLO:</span> Yes, they do receive pensions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Thank you Patrick for being a man and coming to represent your family in this situation and bringing your home closer to the Commission.</p>
