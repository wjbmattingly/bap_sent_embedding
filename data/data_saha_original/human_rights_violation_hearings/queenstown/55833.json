It concerns the killing of your son on the 11th of September 1980 in Sada after he was shot by the police.\n Would you like to tell us what happened please.",

            "It is like that.  In 1980 in September there was, there were boys from the secondary school Emhlotshana, they were students there and a certain teacher there asked them to collect money in preparation for a journey.\n Well, after they had collected this money it happened that they did not undertake that journey and time went on and when they saw that they were not going for the journey, they went to the teacher to demand for their money.\n And it was then that there was  a clash between the boys and the teacher and the teacher decided to phone the policemen in the Ciskei.\n So the policemen came and they had shambocks with them and the school boys ran away.  They went to all the neighbouring schools.\n So they came to the school where my son was schooling and they asked them to go out of the class rooms.  And the \nQUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n2 T DECEMBER\nboys went up a hill, they were in the company of some girls and Sipho December, my son, also went up the hill.\n The name of the hill is Emhlotshana and when they were there, they gathered together and they were intending to hold a meeting up there in the mountain.\n And the matter to be discussed was the money that they had given to the teacher and go and tell the authorities that they were not getting the money from the teacher.\n Whilst they were still there, the policemen from the Republic came, driving in land rovers, there were about three land rovers.  They drove up this hill a little and there was a wind coming from the other side and the policemen threw tear gas at them, at the children.\n Then they started as a result of the tear gas and some of them climbed further, then I don't know whether that is when they got hold of my son.\n Those who were arrested were beaten up irrespective of whether they were boys or girls, so my son was taken into the police van by the Ciskei police and they took him to Frontier Hospital on the 11th day.\n Then on the 12th, and I was at work, the policeman came to my house to explain that Sipho December had died.\n I was at work then they called me back from work, so I got the news that Sipho was dead.  At that time, I can't tell who took him to Russel's, whether it was the policeman or it was Russel himself.  Then a messenger from the court came with a letter that we may not bury on a weekend, but we were to bury on a week day.\n So we did exactly that, we buried him on a Wednesday.  So there was nothing we could do, we did not investigate as to how he got hurt, because at that time, we were not \nQUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 T DECEMBER\nallowed even to say anything against the Government of the Ciskei.\n So we buried my son and it was just that.
