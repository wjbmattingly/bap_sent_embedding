<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MFENE SIMON YOYO:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Thank you. We shall now ask Revd Xundu to lead the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Mr Yoyo, we greet you in the name of the Commission. By the way, where were you born?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> My birth place is in King William's Town in the locality of Tamaga in Nonewe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> What is your clan name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> My clan name is Mtene Shatilesa Jambasi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you Jambasi. By the way in your story you say you were arrested. What was the cause of this arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> Sir, I was arrested because of this country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Say it again. I didn't understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> I was arrested for the history of this country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> What was your contribution to the history?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> I contributed to the history of this country because I had heard that our land had be taken away from us by the Whites.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a> And then I decided to be committed and have a contribution. Then I was deeply involved in the struggle of fighting for the liberation of this land from foreigners.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a> Then I found myself in jail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> What organisation were you a member of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> I was a member of the PAC, commonly known as</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>QUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>2 MS YOYO</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>Porqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Were you arrested in East London and who tortured you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> Truly speaking I was arrested in East London at three o'clock on the 12th of April 1963. I was then sent to the Cambridge police station by those policemen who had picked me up on the streets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a> They handed me over to a man named Donald Card at the police station in Cambridge. </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Then how did he handle you? Did he lay a charge against you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> When I met that man Donald Card, he asked me what church was I getting to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a> Then I said I was an Anglican Church member, then he asked me about politics. Then I said I knew nothing about it, then he asked me why I didn't know anything about politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a> Then I said to him I was not so much concerned, because I was concerned about my home affairs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Were you saying that because you were running away from accusations because you were actually Porqo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Go on. How did he handle you during the time of the detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> Then Card said to me, all what you are saying is not acceptable to me. I don't hear it, because I have got a lot of information about you that you go up and down the streets of East London organising people that they should be against the White rule.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a> So what you are saying is not the truth. Now could you tell the truth. Then I said I had no other truth but what </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>QUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>3 MS YOYO</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>I am saying, then he clapped me and I tried to protect myself, then they hit me with a baton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a> At the same time, I stood up because I wanted to fight back, then the other policemen held me, stopped me. They made me to sit down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a> They took a chair and then they lifted up my hand and my legs and put them on the chair and one policeman held my hands behind the chair, one other one held me on the legs and then Donald took his baton and he beat me severely, such that my feet were swollen in a very bad way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a> Then after finishing, he said, this person does not want to tell the truth. Then I think let's throw him out of the window. Yes, they did that. They lifted me up, there were about four of them. There were also Black men, but they were not beating me, they were just helping.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a> Then they let me hang out of the window. You see the police station there, this office was upstairs, then they let me hanging there and they threatened to just let me go out through the window.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a> Then I didn't say anything, but after a time, they pulled me into their room. Then Donald Card said to me, you don't still want to tell the truth, then I said I had nothing to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a> Then I asked him what is there around your waist. Then he said, this is my rifle. Then I said to him, why don't you shoot me with it, because I've got no other truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a> So he went away. They left me with the Black policeman because I think they had gone for tea. At the time from seven o'clock at night until ten o'clock I was beaten and kept there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a> Then they gave up at that time and took me to the cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>QUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>4 MS YOYO</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> When did they take you to the cell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> No, I was in the police station in Cambridge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Now, according to the statement, they said they took you to Nonqoqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> We were sent to the Nonqoqo prison. After they had beaten us and those places had subsided, then we were again kept in the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did you not appear before a court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> No, we did not. In stead we, it took us eleven months, we were kept there for eleven months whilst they were investigating about us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Then, what did they do with you? Did they send you to Robben Island?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> They sent us to Nonqoqo prison. After that we were sent to court, that was in 1964, on the 10th of February, then we were sentenced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> How many years sentence did you get?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> I was sentenced three years and the sentences varied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> There in Robben Island you were later transferred to Victor Verster prison. Were you also tortured there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> Yes, we were ill-treated even there, because we were beaten up even on arrival.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Do you perhaps know the names of the policemen who were ill-treating you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> One that I noticed was Kleinhans who used to beat us up. He was Kleinhans, that is the name of the policeman who used to beat up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Then in Robben Island and Victor Verster what happened, when did you leave the places?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>QUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>5 MS YOYO</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> We then got transferred in 1966, if I am not mistaken to Victor Verster prison. At Victor Verster prison it was slightly better, though the treatment was harsh, but we were united there, so they did not exceed in stead I could see that there was some cruelty, because one time we were given some food that was contaminated with a glass, fine glass.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a> That was when we were coming from work and as we were sitting and I was trying to show, I could feel the glass particles, then I announced that there was something wrong with the food. There was glass mixed with the food.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Do you know who gave you this food?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> Oh, I have forgotten, it was a White man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Yes, we understand your story. Now do you perhaps have any requests or any wish that we should investigate this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> I can't hear with this other ear. My wish to the Commissioner is that this men who used to beat me up and I had not done anything to him, he was beating me for my, for what belonged to me, that is Donald Card, should be investigated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Do you have any other wish that you would like to tell us about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> Now I should say my requests is that this Commission because they should consider I am old, I wish the Government therefor could be of help to me, even to my children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Now, do you mean your own children or you mean your grandchildren?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> They are my children, I am talking of my children. Because when I left this country I was a bachelor and</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>QUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>6 MS YOYO</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>therefor I had to get married in my old age. The first of those children is 15 years old, that is my first born.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a> He is 15 and he is in standard 5.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> The second one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> The second one is 12 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> In what standard is he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> And he is in standard 2. I only have two children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you then. Is there any other thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did you have any cattle to pay lobola with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> I have another request. I would like to give some message to the Africans here as we are gathering here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Oh, please wait. Let's do it this way. You are now through with what you asked the Commission to do for you, because this Commission wanted to listen to how you were tortured and also your organisation you supported, is well known.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a> Thank you. Over to you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> We would like to thank Revd Xundu. Should I check with my colleagues if there are any questions. Adv Denzil Potgieter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Mr Yoyo, just one thing. You said to us that you were sentenced to three years imprisonment. On what charge was that? Why were you sentenced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> I was charged for continuing with the aims of a banned organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Ntsiki Sandi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Donald Card, do you think that he is - where is his whereabouts today? Is he still with the police</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>QUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>7 MS YOYO</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>services?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MS YOYO:</span> After coming back from jail, I understand that Donald Card was elected a mayor of East London. I do not know whether he is still the mayor or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Mr Yoyo, we would like to thank you. As I am looking at you, you still have very young children. As I am looking at you, you are quite an elderly person, but even though the things that you are narrating before this Commission, as I am trying to look back, it was at least 32 years back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a> But as you are now narrating to us, it is clear that you still have a vivid memory as relating the atrocities which Donald Card did against you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a> We have no doubt as a Commission that those things are still stuck in your mind, as even though they happened some 32 years ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a> That is in fact a testimony to the effect that there are things which we may not forget, there is some people who say that we must forget the past, but it is clear that we can never forget the past.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a> Those things which happened, those years, they are still in people's minds and what we think we should do is to never to forget, but to think our history alive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a> We would love to thank you dearly for your contribution as a person. We would love to thank the organisation that you stood for. Their contributions to the liberation struggle were so enormous at that particular point in time, to fight racial discrimination, we would love to salute you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a> But on the other hand we will not allow you to give a message, because that will be setting a bad precedence for us and perhaps we might find ourselves being converted into </p>
