A short while thereafter they went up the street.\n After a time, we could still hear the singing and this time they were now stoning with - they had taken the stones from a nearby house, because there were some bricks there that were going to be used for building a house.",

Vuyisile was in the bedroom and I was moving in and out of the kitchen and the bedroom, looking after the children.\n Then I went to him in the bedroom and I told him that they were demanding for the car key, then he said ... (tape ends) ... had done whatever they had done to take it out of the garage and it was now in front of the kitchen.\n Then we saw the car burning.  The next minute I saw the children walking outside, then I called them in.\n I called them into the house.  Bondiwe said, Mama, they have instructed us to go outside.  So I went to Vuyisile, then I said, Vuyisile, the children are outside.\n Then he said, all right.  Then he said it is all right.  So I went back and I decided to talk to this people who were stoning and chanting to ask them what do they actually want.\n Then they said they wanted Phaka, they were desperate, they wanted Phaka.  And they asked me to go out because the house was burning.\n Then I saw some fire and I went out.  I did not even have the chance to go back to the room, I just went out.  The gate was locked, because we normally lock in the evenings.\n But I managed to squeeze myself out of the yard, and I had forgotten about the children because I was confused.  Then one of them said, here are your children.\n As we were standing with people still chanting, one girl talked to me and asked whether Phaka was my son.  Then I said, yes, it is my only son that I have.\n Then he said he was an informer, therefor I should hand QUEENSTOWN HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 SL PHAKA\nhim over to them.  Then I said, all right, I am handing him over to you, even to God.\n Then he said, don't pray.  Don't pray old woman, then I said, okay.  Then the house got burnt with Vuyisile inside.",

Then if there is anything that the Commissioner could help you with, we shall make a proposal to the President.\n So we thank you for coming forward and we shall therefor ask you to go back to your seat.",
