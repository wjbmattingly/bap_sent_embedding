My husband said now the children have requested to go to school, now why did you not just punish them like normal kids.  Why did you have to assault them like this?  It was at about five o' clock when we locked ourselves in the house and stones were thrown and these people could not get into the house.  I was pressing the other door while my husband was blocking the other one.  They decided to get into the house through the ceiling and they assaulted us.  They were throwing stones at us, they were hitting us with shamboks, with knobkirries.  While we were busy fighting for the door it was obvious that we did not have any chance.  They were already in the house through the ceiling and my daughter had a child in her hands.  I decided to get the child.  They called me, they said get into the van.  My husband was thrown into another van.  He could not even walk.  I was in the van and he was in the other van.  He was together with the members of Imbokhoto.  One of them hit me with a gun-butt.  I was asking them why were they doing this?  This man drove.\n I know the name of a person, but I cannot call him by name and he said this woman is already injured and she has a baby.  I want you to let her escape.  These other gentlemen agreed.  Then he took me to number two and I was left behind in the van with this other man who was sitting on my left side.  He came back from the shop with Ultramel\nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n4 B SKOSANA\ncustard.  We gave this child the custard.  When it was dark we left and we passed through number one.  They turned right at the corner that was a house where S S was staying.  They drove straight.  I started crying.  After a long silence the driver asked me what is it that I want them to do.  I said to them I want to go back home.  They took me back home and they said do not sleep at your home because when they come back they are going to kill you.  I went to my next door neighbours.  I spent some few hours with them.  \n At about three o' clock in the morning I wanted Bonanie to take my children and, indeed, they were on their way to come to where I was.  We decided to leave, all of us, to go home and when we arrived I saw my husband lying on the stoep and I touched his pulse.  He was cold, he was already dead.  We called the policemen and they came to take him.  The axe that was used to chop my door was taken by the policemen and they took all the pieces that were there and they took the axe as I have mentioned already.  I will stop there.

We were just coming for break and they were just at home.  Mr father was also at home because he was sick.  My father asked them why are you so early from MOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n7 S SKOSANA\nschool?  They said to him we were asking to have afternoon studies at our school, but Imbokhoto does not want us to have afternoon studies.  As we were talking in the house we decided to leave because we were still at primary school and my elder brothers stayed at home.  I think it was this discussed that they should go to the Tribal Authorities, but as we were on our way to school we saw that the high school pupils were not getting into the school yards.  There was not any way for us to go into school anyway.  We decided go back home.\n When I arrived at home, it was at about four o' clock I took the axe to go and chop wood.  Even before I could finish chopping the wood a car drove in, many cars driven by Imbokhoto members stopped at home and I left chopping the wood.  I ran to the stoep where my mother and them were sitting and I took the child.  They were talking and my father said to them, please, do not get into my yard because I am the owner here and I pay the rent.  They did not know what to do.  They wanted to get into the yard, but they stood back and one of them forcefully entered the yard and my father fought with him.  My mother went into the house to get my father a weapon.  They tried to fight.  We thought that they were driving away, but from far away another car approached and they started shooting.  They started pushing the doors and my parents were already in the house at that time blocking the doors and realising that the doors could not get open.  They jumped over the roof and they got into the house through the ceiling.  They climbed on top of my father's car and all the windows were broken.  My mother took the child from me and my mother said to them, I am leaving with this grandchild of mine.  I said to mum, mum \nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n8 S SKOSANA\ntake the child, at least they will save you.  \n Then they all left.  We decided to go to our neighbours to spend the night there.  At about 12 o' clock, midnight, we were told that my mother had arrived and she had been taken to another house.  Very early, at about two o' clock in the morning our next door neighbour said to us there are people getting into your home, do you want to peep through.  We said, no, we are scared, we do not want to.  At about five o' clock in the morning when it was light we said let us go home and find out who are these people who were getting into the house.  \n There was a white van at the gate and we went into the house.  Just before we could get into the house my father was lying on the stoep.  He was already dead and we said let us go and find out where mum is.  On our way we met her and we said to her, mum, father is at home and he is dead.  We all went back home.  The police were called to remove the corpse.  That is it.",

We said to them there is no way to dictate terms to us, we have a very large family.  The comrades were in the yard and they were drinking tea.  The soldiers arrived and they said can you please disperse, we only want 50 people.  The comrades were stubborn and they were promised teargas and one of the comrades said let us go, it does not help to be stubborn because they will end up shooting us.  The boys left and the soldiers left.  The comrades realised that the soldiers were gone and they came back.  The soldiers realised that they went back to the house and they threw their teargas.\n Another man stood up and he wanted to talk to the soldiers to tell them that the man who had just passed away is the owner of the house and friends and relatives are here to bury, but the police could not listen.  They threw teargas.  The soldiers picked the boys up and they took them to Kwaggafontein.  On the day of the funeral we were driving in my father's car and we were on our way from the cemetery.  Teargas was thrown at us by the soldiers.  They kept on shooting their teargas.  We were many in the car and they shot at the car.  The driver of the car was a very experienced driver and he dodged their teargas canisters.  \nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n10 S SKOSANA",
