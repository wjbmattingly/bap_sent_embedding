In terms of the Act we are obliged to find out what were the circumstances at the time, what were the different\nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n3 MAHLANGU\nperspectives and motives, what did which group do, what\nreally was the bigger picture.  Now you give evidence about the Mbokoto people taking you away on your own, torturing you, giving you a tough time, beating you up.  You were a leader, you were chairman of the UDF branch there at Kwagga.  We had a number of other witnesses today who talked about the youth, and they implicated the youth, on abductions, killings, necklacing.  You say in your own statement our programme of action was to fight or cripple but when I ask you you simply say to protect ourselves.  I mean what did you do to protect yourself?  Do you have any knowledge, can you help us?  Maybe even confidentially, not here, to give us a bigger picture of specific action.",

But if you would be kind enough to, when we see each in an in camera situation please share with us so we can get the bigger picture because we need to report to the nation so that everybody can understand.  May I then at this stage thank you very much for coming to the stand.  Also for your openness and your frankness.  We will certainly, if time allows, and it being occasioned for us, we will meet again.  At the moment we will study, as Dr Ally has said, what you have given us and we will follow through on that side and I personally look forward to spending some more time with you to just brief me more about getting to an understanding of the bigger picture of the conflict.  I really appreciate that and thank you very much.  You may step down.",
