<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I call Mrs Kate Sibanyoni to the stand.  Is she here?  Is the witness Mrs Sibanyoni?  Is my pronunciation right, Tom?  Is Fikila here?  Shall we then look at the next witness.  Sorry, going to the next witness.

<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> ... and we peeped through the windows and we saw Imbokhoto people surrounding the school.  We just went out of the classrooms to have a look at what was happening and they got into the yard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEROKE:</span> You said they came home and they pointed you, the three of you.  How many of you were you pointed out actually?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> We were many students at Magazinie where we were assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEROKE:</span> What was the reason behind this assault?  When you are assaulted you do not just keep quiet.  Were you asking them the reason for your assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> No, we did not ask because there was no one to ask.  They were busy assaulting us, nobody asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEROKE:</span> Did you not report this matter to your Principal that you have been assaulted and you do not know the reasons?</p>

<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>2 E MALAZA</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> No, we did not report this to the Principal.  We never reported this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Manthata.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Elsie, at this time had you heard anything about KwaNdebele Government and independence and talk about independence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> No, I was not aware of anything.  I never heard of KwaNdebele Government before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> And then after this day, did you not hear anything that could have had relation with what took place the previous day at school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> Can you please repeat your question, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> My question is after you were shambokked out of school, two, three days or so thereafter, did you not hear about anything that could have caused that kind of a whipping out of school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> No, I never heard anything, any reason for our assault because when we came back from Magazinie, I was at home.  Our grandmother was looking after us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> And as they were shambokking you at Magazinie, what were they saying to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> They were saying many things, but I was so heartbroken and I did not even listen to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> And thereafter did you make a follow-up of some of your friends who have been taken with you to Magazinie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> What are you talking about, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> I am saying you were not alone at Magazinie, yes.  What I want to know is did you hear anything about, did you learn anything about your friends thereafter?  That is those that you were taken with to Magazinie.</p>

<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> And none of you ever talked about the cause of the assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> Nobody said anything about the cause of our assault.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> At home were you the only child who was attending school at that time, in your family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> No, we were five in number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> In number and even at home there was never talk about the activities of Imbokhoto at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> Not at all, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Nor did they ever talk about the activities of the students with regard to, you know, the affairs of KwaNdebele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> No, my grandmother and my grandfather never talked of such issues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Thank you.  No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Dr Ally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Elsie, you say that when you came back from Magazinie your grandmother and other family members could not recognise you.  Could you just tell us in a bit of detail of the nature of the assault?  What was actually done to you and what was used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> They were using shamboks, they were using sticks and they were using sticks and just any other weapon.  They would hit us on the heads and they would go down until to the toes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> And how long did this go on for?  Can you remember, do you have an idea?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> They arrived at home at about seven and they brought us back the next morning at five o' clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>MOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>4 E MALAZA</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> And did this beating take place throughout that time?  From the time that you got to Magazinie to the time when they took you back home?  Did they continue to beat you all that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> Yes, they assaulted us throughout the night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> And how many people were involved in this?  Can you remember, do you have an idea?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> I cannot remember, but there were many of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> And the people beating you?  Were there many of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> It was the whole group of Imbokhoto.  There were many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> And do you know any of them today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> I can only identify them, but to mention them by names, really, I do not know their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> But you can recognise them by their faces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> Yes, I can recognise them by their faces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Elsie, just to go back to your, what was happening at your school.  I know you say that you were new at the school, it was your first year in high school, you were in standard six.  This event took place in the early part of the year in April, but can you recall whether, from the time that you got to the high school, the beginning of the year, to when Imbokhoto came into the school.  Were there any boycotts or class disruptions or anything happening at the school?  Can you shed any light on that?  Do you recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> There were no boycotts in 1985 and 1986.  We were going to school every day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Elsie, you said you did not see any doctor, that your grandmother attended to you.  Is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>5 E MALAZA</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> I never went to the doctor, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> And how long did it take for you to recover from this?  Can you remember, was it a long, did you stay out of school for a long time after this beating or when did you actually go back to school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> After the assault by Imbokhoto people, it was quite a long time before we could go back to school.  My shoulders were injured and I spent a long time at home, but when it was time to go to school we all went back to school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Thank you very much Elsie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Joyce.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEROKE:</span> Elsie, you say in your statement they were assaulting you and some of them were cutting your hair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> After we had been assaulted in the morning before they could release us they cut our hair.  That was Imbokhoto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEROKE:</span> Is that after they had assaulted you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> Yes.  They took our hair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEROKE:</span> Were they doing this to everybody who was there or to the girls?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> We were the girls in this ward and we were taken outside and they just cut the hair on top here, not the whole head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEROKE:</span> Now, did you not ask them where they were taking your hair to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> No, we did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Elsie, you say in your statement that the other two people who were taken with you, abducted with you, were Winnie and Hessie Malaza.  Do you know whether they made statements to the TRC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> Yes, they submitted, no they have not submitted</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>MOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>6 E MALAZA</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>their statements.  They are not residing in this area.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know where they live presently?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> Yes, I know where they stay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you give us their address please or can you tell us whereabout they live?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS MALAZA:</span> Yes, I will give you their addresses after this session.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you very much.  Elsie, thank you for coming to us.  We will have to look at some of the matters that you shared with us.  It is very confusing if there is no external evidence to the fact and especially if one cannot understand it and, unfortunately, your not having asked questions at the time makes it very difficult for us to understand the frame of mind of those that did assault you, but nevertheless, thank you very much for having come to us and we wish you well.</p>
