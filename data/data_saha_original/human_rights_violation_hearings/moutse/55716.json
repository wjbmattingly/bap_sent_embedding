They make me take my clothes off and assaulted me.  When I went into the car I was not able to see myself and my whole body was numb.  They sticked me on the stomach and one of the intestines appeared outside.  It appeared right inside the stomach.  They assaulted me really.  A person is very hard.  It is only God who knows him.  I do not know why because I did not even do anything outside the law.\n When we arrived at Siyabuswa they put soap and they\nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n2 J M SEKHUKHUNI\ntook a hosepipe and they poured water.  Then in that foam they put us in that foam and they came with shamboks.  We were beaten.  Yes, they really assaulted us.  Yes, they assaulted us.  Skosane tried to speak.  They said this old man what does he want here?  Then Makawe, they said this little Sotho is adamant.  Then he sticked me and I tried to defend myself.  The Ndebele people assaulted me.  Yes, they did.  They released us.  The way they assaulted me, I left my shoe, that I was even frightened to go back and collect that shoe.  I have no further words to touch there and there.
