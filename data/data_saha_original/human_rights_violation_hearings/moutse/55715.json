            "Mr Chair, I remember very well on the 12th June 1986 I was at home.  There came a certain man by the name of Petrus Mahlangu.  In fact it is a business person.  He said to us, we were two, that it is getting to Pretoria so therefore has suspected a lot of cars and his suspicions was Mbokoto.  He told us that he resides at Tweefontein Erf.  He gave us his kombi to go and see whether it is true what has said.  Fortunately enough we met with a lot of cars.  If my memory still serves me well I think we were about to eight.  Therefore we met with those cars  at Tweefontein E.   Don't remember what I have said, I said on the 12th June 1986 and therefore those (indistinct) stopped us and then the questions they asked us they said they wanted the comrades who burnt down their shops.  We said we don't know nothing about that because we said we want to negotiate with them.  They failed.  They caught us, particularly some of us escaped but unfortunately enough to me they caught me and then they asked me about the leaders.  I responded to them that I don't know nothing\nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n2 NTULI\nabout the leaders and then they said they are abducting me, they are going with me, I am going to show them the leaders and they after that I must bring back their shops, everything.  And then they started to beat me like a wild animal, busy beating me and then in turn they were, what can I say, they were holding all types of weapons that even others maybe never been into existence in this world, held by the Mbokoto.  Mbokoto took a litre, they gave me, I drank it.  They said to me I must drink that particular litre of petrol, they want to set me alight or to burn me down.  I said what have I done.  They said you know.  There were many, even at that time I don't know if it was the Mbokoto Youth League or was Mbokoto what, something.  Don't know what was their strategy.  They beat me, I fell down.  There came two bakkies, there were some tyres.  They poured petrol and then at that time I was already laying down bleeding.  My question I said are you really killing me.  They said yes boy we kill you today because we caught you.  Therefore a certain man, I can't remember him very clearly facially, he was holding a beitel.  He chopped me here, he chopped me here,  he broke my right leg and then one of them took out his firearm and he pointed at me.  Somebody stopped him, said no don't kill him we want to burn him.  It was a surprise to me because I didn't know what I had done because I said it is the wrong idea that you want I must adopt it because I am not following your procedure.  That is just before I am youth, then you get at me that maybe I have done one, two, three and that is an implication.  Therefore I think it was past nine to ten that time, I was busy lying down, people were going up and down screaming and then two cars came and then they said to me we are coming back to\nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n3 NTULI\npick you up.  We were two.  I was with my colleague, that is Sam something Matimunya.  Stays at Vlaklaagte number 1.  And therefore even himself was already assaulted, tortured, done everything the way Mbokoto was brutal minded against to the members of our society.  Then I said to him let us escape because on Mbokoto's return we are going to be abducted or captured or kidnapped.  Then we started crawling because we could not walk on our own.  We were assaulted, we were injured, we went to another.  So that everyone should understand what I am presenting here.  We entered into one  yard.  When we arrived there we were badly injured.  They put us under dirty clothes.  Mbokoto was busy.  When they came back they asked where are these boys.  At that time we were hiding.  We were crying, we were assaulted, blood was all over.  We stayed there until a kombi came there collecting people who were injured and people who were standing outside they said some of the boys are in this yard and they came there, they picked us up like a small child.  We were put inside that kombi.  I don't remember the colour of the kombi, we were taken to Kalafong Hospital in Pretoria.  My leg was broken, I was waiting to be plastered, to be stitched.  I can't remember the days but I think three, four, five days.  Members of the committee came there to see us in hospital.  They wanted to see us when we came out of the hospital.  They were worried about our safety.  We asked them what was happening here that we were assaulted like this.  That is the time when we were recovering from the injuries.  We were unconscious when we came there.  They said to us Mbokoto assaulted us. They said Majozi was there.  Piet Ntuli was there.   They called all their names because Mbokoto was everywhere.  I can't furnish their names because\nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n4 NTULI\nI was not a member of Mbokoto.",

We were just an ordinary committee that we understand fundamentally that human right violation it is very much unconstitutional and therefore the way Mbokoto did against ourself it was absolutely rotten so therefore that particular committee was not against the properties of Mbokoto because the property has done nothing to the community at large but we said what is wrong with Mbokoto because we said if we can sit down with it and discuss and get our differences I think at the end of the day there will be agreement between the community and that particular brutal committee or brutal group.",

All of us have political positions, political sympathies, we all have our own political views. Within the Commission though it is important for us to try and get at the nature of the conflict without taking sides on the nature of the political issues involved.  That is a personal and a private matter for individuals.  Within the Commission it is necessary for us to understand this conflict in all its aspects from all sides, and that is the reason that I was asking you those questions.  Not in an attempt to say which political position was right and which political position was wrong.  But to try and get as accurate a picture of what was happening as possible.  Now we have heard testimony that people who were perceived to be members of Mbokoto yesterday\nMOUTSE HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n8 NTULI\nand the day before speak about property being destroyed, speak about people being necklaced and implicate youth and implicate comrades in those activities.  Now you spoke about yourself as being involved in a committee as showing some understanding of the conflict.  Now if you don't know anything about who was doing that to Mbokoto then that is accepted.  You obviously can only answer on what you know about it.  But I asked you a question very directly about the Mbokoto necklacing and the Mbokoto destruction of property and you said to me that in your understanding it was Mbokoto itself who was doing that.  Now I want to come back to that and I want to know whether that is your response or is your response that you don't know who was doing those things to Mbokoto?",
