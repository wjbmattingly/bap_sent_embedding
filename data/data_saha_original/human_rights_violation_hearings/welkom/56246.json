            "Well, I think the most important event were that - ja, what happened to me - I must just get started now.  This thing happened in September - I'll get you the date, Sir - September 1987, the Children Conference, around the Children Conference in Harare.  That is what it was all - in that period, I must explain, I was the chairperson of the Dutch anti-apartheid movement for many years.  Of course, by then I must have been quite known to the South African whatever department of police was involved in this, because I had been active since 1970.  I have always been part of the group who were strong supporters of the ANC, so we were not like, say, the British and the others, you know, sort of - we were very strong ANC supporters - what makes us a little bit different than the other groups.  Also, what must have brought special attention, especially from people like Craig Williamson, to the Netherlands is the fact that Buren Scheitema (?) and Breyten Breytenbach, of course, operated from here.  That the whole ... (inaudible) ..., I think, was very much done from here.  So they must have had a lot of information about the Netherlands and the who was who, who was who list and another question what - another thing that might have made them a bit more aggressive towards us is the fact that, well, it was said in the press and in a way it was true, a lot of people were also members in the Communist Party and I think that always upset them more than anything else.  So for years we were - we were, especially when it came to economic boycott and that sort of issue, you know, we always went for the tougher issues, not so much for the kind of issue where it was something ... (inaudible) ... with all respect.  And I was involved - just to give you the picture of the time, 1987, I was the chairperson, I was the most visible person.  I had contacts with Craig Williamson, not - I can tell you later on, I can tell you a bit more about that, not so - not very friendly or not very open or something like that, but he knew who I was and he had an extra sort of aggression towards me, because he couldn't get a grip on me, but he tried a few times is that he would arrive, say, very early in the morning at Schipol Airport, phone me from there at my home, saying, \"Listen, hey, I'm at the airport and I've got no money.  Please come help me out, you know, with some money and I'll return it to you\", and, of course, he could do that because was working in Geneva for the IUF so - but that was, of course, you know, to establish - yes, to establish a relationship, you know, and then - because he couldn't do it by another way, he did it like that.  Well, I always sent the secretary of the movement, Fons Felix (?) ... (inaudible).\nDR DANIEL (?): So he couldn't get close to you in any way?",

That was in 1974 or 1975 - a conference organized by the United Nations against apartheid and he was there and that was - I mean, for him it must have been a terribly interesting conference, because Thabo was there and Mzo, Jele, you know.  I mean, the guys who were at that moment - also people like Vilakabo was sort of like a rising star at that time.  He could see, you know, the way they were operating and I was close to them.  So who was getting some importance and who wasn't.  Anyway, Williamson was there and he tried all the time to invite me for lunch and for breakfast and I don't know what, but I was hold back by - especially by M P Naicker, who was an older ANC man, who said to me, \"Don't do it, you know\" ... (inaudible).  I thought at that time that it was a sort of - almost a sort of jealousy that they didn't want me to go out with another guy.

There was, let's say, the anti-apartheid movement level, there was the open solidarity movement with people like Klaas and Helene, who were, let's say, operating in Africa.  So that was a bit different.  We would take up their cause, of course, but they were not so much - but then there was something that made us particularly scared also when these things happened is that my involvement in Operation Vula, because that was something that was not supposed to be known by anybody and I think they didn't come back, but ...

That is what was most important of everything, so we wanted to use this - \"We\" is in this case Joe Slovo, Mac Maharaj and Oliver Tambo.  They wanted me to come to Africa for consultations and use that sort of conferences, you see, to - so I went.  I first went to Lusaka.  I stayed in the Ridgeway Hotel in Lusaka, let's say a week before the conference started, or a few days, and in that hotel I had some contacts with people - the Dutch people who were based in - actually, especially, no, one, one, Lucia Bratsoles (?), who was based in Lusaka, and in charge of communications.  The communication was set up and - she was involved with the operating inside the country, I think that was it.  No, no, that was not yet but she was in Lusaka for the set-up of the whole thing and I was in there and I had seen a few people.  I saw, for example, Siphiwe, who came for his second disguise round to be, you know, and I had to take all sort of measurements, etcetera, so on, and he came to my hotel room to do that, you know.  He was brought, I think, very late and even very early in the morning.  Other people I had contact with was Joe Slovo came to the hotel.  Well, for talks, of course, we went out.  It was also quite normal.  They could do that.  I'm making excuses that we were sort of - but I was also the chairperson of the anti-apartheid movement and we were all friends, you see, so they would come to the hotel, we would have a drink and a meal and be quite noisy, you know, to make sure that they saw that we were still very good friends.  Occasionally we went to see them and - but the talks you would do in a car.  You know, they would take them in a car - talks in the car.  Other people come with you ...

You see, that is the sort thing - I mean, we were busy there.  Chris Hani, I think, he came to the hotel because I had to take a print of his teeth, you know, for a new set of teeth for a disguise, and I think that he'd been to the hotel room and left late, because he was brought in the dark, of course, by two guys who stood outside because they didn't want him to be seen - to be seen humiliated by me taking prints of his teeth.  I'll never forget that scene.  He left and then so I slept and then the next morning we had - then I had a meeting with Rashid.  He picked me up in his car.  He sent one of his assistants ...

I didn't give it to the reception and then I opened the door and the bed wasn't made, nothing was - it was really too early, you know, because the girls who were cleaning the room were sort of a floor below, they were busy or just started or something, but there was one chair.  It's next to my bed.  There was a bottle.  It was a brown glass bottle.

Now, one thing, I mean I was alert but I was not - you know, I was actually - looking back, I can't understand, you know.  I see what a sort of a half nervous wreck I am now, how cool and calm I was in those days, you know.  Actually nothing could really upset me, but, seeing the bottle, I knew immediately that it was something - here was something wrong or, you know, strange, because, I mean, you know if you bring in a thing like that yourself or not.  The door is locked.  You've got the key with yourself.  So I didn't touch it and I looked for that lady who cleaned the room and I asked her - I said, \"Have you been in my room?\" ... (inaudible) ... \"No, no, no\", and I could see that she was honest, you know, because she was sort of making an excuse, as if I was complaining.  So then I went back and I looked at the bottle and there was liquid in it.  There were no pills in it.  There was liquid in it, because - and I thought, well, anyway, somebody put it there, so I can just, you know - it won't go off, you know, when you touch it and I wanted to know.

That's why I know it was the day of my going from Lusaka to Harare, and Siphiwe came - Ngabuza - came by just for a last thing - what I don't know, but anyway he came by and he came into my room and I said, \"Look at that\" and he said, \"Jesus, don't touch it, get it out of here\", you know.  And I said, \"Can't we get, you know, your people to come in?\"  He said, \"We don't have that sort of people\", you know, because this was Vula, you see, and Vula was a very small group then.  They didn't have - they couldn't.  It was a difficulty because, as Vula, they couldn't go to their own, you know, people with experts to say, because then they had to reveal why, you know.

I took that thing, put it in the waste bin in the bathroom and also the dirty, you know, tissues and whatever I could produce myself for making it really stink and ugly, you know, so that - because my fear was that when the woman who would come to clean, you know, would just see it, you know, All Vitamins.
