He could also see the problems that the blacknation had. Then he took a decision that amongst all other things he will workfor his nation, especially strive for freedom. In other words he got involvedin politics. At that time when the UDF started he was the chairperson of theUDF in Welkom. In 1983 Edward Viyu Charles was arrested for the very first time.His second arrest was in 1985, near Welkom and Odendaalsrus, on the way to Kroonstad.In 1985 it was a little bit difficult during those times. His life was a littlebit more in shambles, and he spent most of his time in prison, and he relatedhow difficult it was there. He even told us about the torture that went on inthe prison. At that time he was in Mpohadi College, and his parents wished thathe should finish is education. There were people who kept on harassing him.Those were the law people. They were using constant death threats, and theythreatened that they would wipe the whole family out. And there came a timewhere he was told that he would go because he did not want to leave the causefor freedom. He used to talk with us to make us aware as to all that the previousregime was not protecting his nation. He  took an oath and he told himself that he will continue",

The other one survived andhe surrendered, but my brother was killed by the boers. They killed him in avery painful manner. Amongst all other things when he was being buried he wasburied by the police. I believe they just buried him like a dog or a puppy.They were just seeing a corpse, an unknown corpse. There were two policemenwho couldn't - who had a problem burying him. This was a very painful experience.The most cruel of them all was that when we last saw him he was fine and alivein flesh, but now when we had to see him for the last time he was only bones.We buried his bones in 1991.

The police were spreading tear gas and theywere shooting children. He was shot on the way home. Though he was walking withcrutches he was shot, because he was paralysed. I think they shot him roundabout one, because I was fetched by my children when he was already shot. Thatwas a boy and a girl.

I told themthat my child wasn't in the street but he was on his way back from the hospital.They had shot him in the stomach, as well as on the shoulder.  They also stabbed him on the tummy. He stayed there for thewhole day. They took him round about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. At the timewhen they took him they said I will get my child at the police station mortuary.We went there the following day. When they had taken him from the ground I wentto the funeral parlour, but I turned on my way there, I went to look as to whetherthere wasn't any blood there. I got a white man there who was looking there.I asked him what he was looking for there. I asked him whether he was lookingfor the bullets with which he had shot him. Then he was startled, then he stoodup. At that time I left him and I went away. When I tried to get to where myson was they said to me I mustn't get in there. They told me that I'll get himat the police mortuary. The following day I went there. We took him and we buriedhim.

And then it's that time I joinedwith Bram Fischer, and then the others, all the leaders of the Communist Party,Moses Gutane and the others, Sam Khan and so forth and so forth. And then Icame in the Free State then, organising the Communist Party, and after someyears again I went to Johannesburg, came back again to the Free State as anorganiser on the Communist Party in the Free State here. And then I decidedto join the Advisory Board by that time, because I thought that they are gettingthese things right. Once you'll get into these organisations - our townshipswere so bad streets, no water, no houses, all such things. Well, I was a memberof the Advisory Board for about a year, and then I again was chased out of Brandfort,you know, under the pass laws, that I was not working, just a loafer in thetownship here, and intimidating people to be against the Council and so forth, and just like that. ThenI was sent back again to Johannesburg, where I came from, because they saidI was a loafer. So there's a word in Afrikaans that, \"Ons gooi op jou oor dieluin\" - \"You must get out of this area because you are a loafer.\" And then againI came back in the Free State, I started again organising trade unions and soforth and so forth. I started organising the Brandfort Workers Union. I foundthat people were just working there, you know, for nuts, and it was necessaryto organise them into a trade union there. I started to form what they callthe Brandfort Workers Union. Well, I went on just like that until comes rightagain. Just not - to be very short, in 1989 - no, let's say 1976, when theseyoung kids started to be against the Afrikaans. In Brandfort we had what theycalled the Khosas, the students formed themselves into a group, and then itwas called the Khosas. Then these Khosas were, you know, fighting each otherin the black townships. The others did not like the Khosas, and then the policehave to intervene just like that. And then they started to have what they calledthe anti-Comrades. They were fighting now, the schoolchildren, by that time.We had a group of about 15 children who were against the scholars, fightingthe scholars. And then it's where again the clash started again with my wife.She was in there. I couldn't get too much in the whole thing because I was restrictedand banned and house arrested, because I was being restricted and banned from1946, when I was in Johannesburg. And 1950, when these organisations were bannedI was also banned and house arrested and restricted not to go to the churches,and it was just like that. And",

Andthen we started to join up with the Town Council. My wife went in there as acouncillor. I couldn't get in there because I was on the banned list, I wasrestricted not to attend those things. And then she was there for about two,three years as a councillor, and then they, the people of Brandfort, they encouragedus that we should get in there because they know what kind of people we were.Well, we tried to get them houses, to put everything in order, so they werevery much pleased with us. And then at a later stage again they said I shouldalso join with my wife there, you know, to fight for our local rights in ourblack area there. So I got in there too. Well, we got fightings with the localauthorities in Brandfort, fightings with the Provincial Councils, to get sitesfor us there. Well, I managed to get about three locations at Brandfort therethrough my efforts and my wife. So then in 1989 those small kids, or those youngboys were fighting the scholars, the so-called Khosas. Then those anti-Comrades,they started to join with the ANC in Brandfort, and then they started to callme that I am a communist, I am a sell-out, all such things, because before theydid not like me, because the white guys were telling these youngsters and Brandfortpeople that, \"You must hate this Phehlani ... Afrikaans sentence ...\" So someof these youngsters, you know, they were encouraged by whites that they shouldhate me because I'm a communist. And then in 1989 they started to be ANC members,and they too now they started to hate me that I'm a Communist, and then theystarted to say that, \"This man",

I can't do youth work during this time when I am so grown up.\" And thenthey started to say that we should resign from the Council. Well, I said tothem, \"We can resign from the Council, but as soon as we resign everything'sgoing to be at a standstill in your township here, because you can see whatwe have done for you, you people here, you youngsters.\" Well, that group whowere the anti- Comrades, four, five, six of them, they were now the people really,you know, after us, howling, harassing us, swearing at us, doing anything tous, making petrol bombs and all such and such. And then I have to report thematter to the ANC out in Johannesburg, and then they said they knowing all aboutthose children, or the so-called youth at Brandfort. Because I make a reportto the ANC that, \"These children or these youngsters they used to be just hooligans,dagga smokers, rapists. How can you call them youths of the ANC?\" And then theysent some delegation to Brandfort there. They found they couldn't do a thingabout it. In 1992 the squabble was just on - petrol bombing my place and harassingus, and fighting each other. And then they started to kill some other youthsin our township there, the very same guys who were calling themselves ANC youths.Then it happened that in 1991 again they said we should resign from the Council.In July, on the 14th of July, I was at my place there, and I left during theevening. Because my son is a taxi driver I thought of going to the station togo and help him with some passengers who were coming into our area there. Well,I went to the station to help my son. It was around about half past eight. At9 o'clock, when I was from the station, I find my place burning there. The wholecafe was in flames, and I went there shouting, looking for my wife, I couldn'tfind my wife there. I called the police, the police said, \"No, we can't do abloody thing, man, your place is burning.\" \"So where is my wife?\" No, the policecouldn't do a - couldn't help me, so I have to get myself into that burningcafe, drag my wife out there, out of the cafe. The police were standing therejust looking, because they themselves they did not like me in Brandfort of theprevious cases I had with them. And then I asked them, \"Is them no way of helpingme put the flames away?\" They said, \"Ons kan nie jou help nie, Mnr Phehlani.Jy wiet ... Afrikaans ...\" so my cafe have to burn to ashes.

So he said in order to meet us halfway he is going to Johannesburgto get funds from the organisation in Johannesburg. And he had got a telegramthat was signed Joe - signed by Joe, that he was coming. So when this Joe camethey came in the morning. There were two of them in an Opel Kadett car. Whenthis Joe came there were two of them, and I can't remember what he said thisother one's name was. But normally he used to take me to work, so this otherone, the one who died with him, accompanied him and they took me to work. Butthis other one remained home and said he was tired, so Mpho prepared his bedroomfor him for him to sleep there whilst they were taking me to work. At 4 o'clockwhen I knocked off Mpho, together with this one ... (incomplete - end of SideA, Tape 6) ... all three of them were there. They had supper and they left.During the night - we hadn't locked the back door for them to come in, so thatthey don't disturb us. During the night at about 9.00 pm I heard thatthere was somebody in the house, so I got up, switched on the light. This otherone who had said he was tired when they came in the morning was sitting in thelounge on the couch in darkness. Then I switched on the light and asked him,\"Why are you sitting in darkness?\" He said, \"No, I don't want to disturb you.\"But what I noticed was that he was hiding his face, he didn't want me to beable to see him. Then I asked him where the other two were. He said they werecoming. All right, I left him and I got back to bed. At about 12 midnight Icould hear that Mpho and the other were in too. Then I asked Mpho, \"Are youhere?\" He said, \"No, Mum, I didn't want to disturb you. We are leaving now.\"That was the last I saw of him. In fact I heard from him. The following daywhen I came back from work I asked if Mpho hadn't phoned, and they said he hadn'tphoned. Then I suspected that there was something, because he never used toleave home and not phone for such a long time. Then I started asking his friends,\"Where do you think Mpho is?\" None of them knew, and then I said to them, \"Okay,I am now going to the police for them to help me look for Mpho.\" And what theysaid was, \"Please, Mama, don't go to the police, because the minute you go tothe police Mpho will be harassed. Every time there's something he'll be takento gaol.\" And from what people used to say, people who had been in gaol, thenI felt I would rather not go to the police, because I didn't want him to gothrough what the people said they go through when they are in gaol. We startedtrying to look for Mpho until towards the end of February. Unfortunately I can'tremember the date well.  In The Sunday Times there was an article that three schoolchildren,three students, were killed. The names were there, but fortunately Mpho's namewas wrongly written, so I didn't recognise it. Then that Friday we got a telephonecall from Nelspruit SACC offices to say we should please come to the SACC officesat Nelspruit. So that Friday night we drove over to Nelspruit. When we got toNelspruit we got there Saturday at about 11.00 am, so when we got there thosegentlemen who helped us said they think they have a clue as to where Mpho is,but now we would have to go over to Swaziland, and because it was a weekendwe couldn't go, it had to be the Monday. We had driven over to Nelspruit beingfour. It was my husband, myself, and a friend of mine, a Mrs Ramagaga, and whenwe got to Virginia we picked up another gentleman who's my friend's husband.So we all drove over to Nelspruit. So on noticing that we had to stay over forthe weekend my husband and this gentleman from Virginia came back, and I remainedwith Mrs Ramagaga. The Monday morning we left for Swaziland. When we got tothe border I couldn't cross over, I didn't have a passport, so they said wecould get emergency passports at the offices, which were about two kilometresaway. We drove back to those offices. When we got there they said they didn'thave forms for emergency passports. Then I remained at Nelspruit Hospital. Ihad a colleague there I knew. Mrs Ramagaga and these two gentlemen from theSACC offices of Nelspruit crossed over to Swaziland. I stayed in the hospitalthat whole Monday, until in the evening when they hadn't come back they prepareda bed for me and I slept in the nurses' home. Tuesday morning at about 9 o'clockMrs Ramagaga came in.  They said they couldn't come to me the previous day becausethey came back very late from Swaziland.

            "Before I start, there was a boy named Aron Mohutu.He was an ANC Youth League member. He used to come to me and recruit me to jointhem and stop being a member of a Dikwankwetla. I told him that I wouldn't beable to join them. It took time, and thereafter he came to me. He said theywere talking about me at the Catholic Church, that if I don't join the ANC YouthLeague they were going to attack me after two weeks and they were going to killme. I will never ever get any forgiveness. He said he talked to them not todo that, then he was giving me two weeks to decide. I refused and told themthat I wouldn't join them. On that very same year that I had my supermarketI lost my supermarket. I tried to earn some living, so I went to Cape Town,to Johannesburg, as well as Durban. When I came back in August 1987 I saw Casspirsin my yard. It was on a morning. That is when I saw my property burning. Thatwas my bedroom suite, as well as saxophones, trumpets, trombones and base tenor,together with property to the value of R4 000,00. By then I had already openedup a tuck shop which had stock that was worth R6 000,00. They told me that Iwas an informer. The Comrades kept on harassing me. My life was now in danger,and by then I was a member of - a parliamentarian during T K Mopede's reign.They kept on harassing me and attacking me until 1990. By then I bought a kombi,and they prevented the people from boarding my kombi, until 1990 they attackedmy home for the second time. It was round about quarter to eight when I wentto J Section. I met with my wife along the way. She was bleeding. She had hireda car and she told me that our home was being attacked. When I got thereI found the furniture burnt down. The windows were broken with stones. I don'tknow how big were these stones. There was absolutely nothing that was salvaged.All my property had been burnt down. I asked her about the children, then shesaid she had hidden them in the toilet. Then they were saying to me why can'tI call Mopede to come and help me. I kept on being attacked until I took himto Qwa-Qwa. I still feel very painful about my property that got lost. My contractwas stopped. I still remember it was Mr Tele Shuping. I had bought stock tothe value of R33 000,00. They told me I must go to Qwa-Qwa because I am a Sotho.He threw me with my identity document and told me that, \"It's been long thatI have been telling you to go to Qwa-Qwa.\" I went to Botshabelo and I lost thatR33 000,00-worth of stock. And at some stage I got my shop broken into and allthe stock stolen. From 1987 my first wife had lost her mind - until the 1984elections (sic), when we separated. I was helping the students at thattime. State President P W Botha had a law that said the children shouldn'teat during break time. During that time I was hiding those students in my officesin the storeroom. When the police came they used to ask me why I didn't givethem permission to come in and assault the children. I told them I was againstthe government of the day. Thereafter I felt very bad when the youth of Botshabeloturned against me, whereas I was fighting for their rights and I was fightingthat they shouldn't be assaulted. I feel very bad. It's a wound that will neverheal to me, because I left my house in Thaba Nchu that I had recently built,which could be to the value of R39 000,00. I had a double garage. I hadto leave the house because I was a Sotho, and I had to go to Botshabelo or Qwa-Qwabecause I was a Sotho. Throughout my life I have lost so much. Thank you.",

You shouldhave taken him home.\" Morakile said to him, \"I promise you we dropped him offzone one.\" After a while that we've been there speaking to Morakile anothergentleman came in.

It's important for the purposes of ourrecords that we know which year it was. Can you remember? It doesn't appearin your statement either. Can you remember what year you buried your son? ---It was in 1990. It was in July, on the 8th of July, if I still remember well.\nAnd that happened in Zone One, Thaba Nchu, is that correct?--- Yes, in Thaba Nchu.\nMrs Daseko, thank you very much for sharing your story withus today. We've heard stories similar to yours from so many - particularly somany mothers about the deaths of their children, and previously when we heardabout these things, particularly for those of us who did not experience sufferingover the past years, we would read about it in the newspaper, or we would hearit on a radio that this person or that person had died, and it would come acrossto us as a number, as a statistic. And what is important about your story isthat we realise that for every number, for every statistic, for every personwho died, that there was a mother and a father, and perhaps a family who mournedthose people, that for every person - the person who died was precious to somebodyelse who was left behind. And if we think of how many people like your son havedied over the last 10, or 20, or 30 years, we get some idea of the amount orthe extent of emotional loss and suffering that his weighing down on this countrylike a grey cloud.\nAnd so we hope that just by telling your story, not only tous here, but to those people in the hall, and to the many, many people, thethousands of people who are listening to it on the radio now, we hope that itmakes your burden a little bit lighter, and that it will make those who arelistening to your story even more determined that this sort of thing shouldnot happen again in our country.\nThe Commission will do its best to try and find out further details about how your son died, and why he died, butthat cannot be done immediately, these things take time, but details will begiven to you when we are in possession of those details.\nSo thank you again very much for coming, and we wish you welland we wish you strength.

In 1989 on the 25thof December he went to the U Section, visiting for Christmas or for the festiveseason. On that very same night of the 25th of December - there was a politicalorganisation called Dikwankwetla. They also call themselves Mopede's Reserves.On that very same night they attacked my aunt's home and my brother was there.When they were asked as to what was the problem they said they were lookingfor the Comrades. My aunt never wanted to open the door, she refused. Thereafterthey kicked the door. They bore holes into the door. It was no longer a door.Then they went away and they promised that they were going to come back on the26th of December. My aunt, as well as my elder brother, as well as my aunt'schildren, they just thought they were threatening, but the following day at8 o'clock in the morning there came a group of people. They were more than 100.When my aunt went outside to ask them as to what they were looking for, theywere still looking for the Comrades. They said she must take the Comrades outof the house because they were looking for them. My aunt flatly refused. Theyheld her, they took her to another man's place where they made arms or weapons.I asked what the name was, they told me it was Mr Mokwena. When they took herto Mr Mokwena's place at U Section they harassed and assaulted her and saidthey wanted the Comrades. They left her, they went to try and attack my elderbrother, as well as my aunt's children.  They wanted my brother mainly because they said they were burninghouses. But when I look at the U Section there wasn't even a single house thatwas burnt down. When they got there they stabbed my elder brother, they shothim with arrows. My brother tried to run away, he ran to my other aunt, butthey chased him, they followed him with spears. My aunt's children also ranaway. When they got to my other aunt at the W Section my aunt closed the doorand they remained outside. She said that she didn't want her house to be destroyed.There was a shack outside at my aunt's place. My brother went into this shack.My aunt's children were able to get into the house. When this mob came, thisvery same Dikwankwetla mob, they tore the shack apart because they were lookingfor my brother. When my brother came out they chopped his head with a panga.My brother tried to run away, but he fell on the street. Each and every oneof them wanted to take his part or to make his share. Then they started stabbinghim each one of them. When we went to report to the police the police askedus whether my brother was dead already. They came after three hours. When oneof my aunt's children went to report to our other elder brother at home - he'salso staying at the W Section - my elder brother went to my home. It was roundabout 10. When he went to my parents he told my parents, but they just couldn'tbelieve it. He didn't die at that very same moment. He was taken after threehours. He was taken to the Universitas Hospital in Bloemfontein. That's wherehe died at 12 o'clock in the evening. Our father went to Universitas to lookfor him, as well as my other sister. They were told that only my father couldsee my brother because his condition was not satisfactory, he was critical.That was the end of my brother. ",

            "My story is this. It was on a Sunday when T K Mopedehad come to Botshabelo. It was a Sunday. On that Sunday I didn't go to church,and I went to listen to T K Mopede's speech with regard to us being Dikwankwetla.When he had finished delivering his speech we went back home. We dispersed,we went to our respective places. On our way back apparently there were Comradeswho were watching us. There were two of us. As we were on the way home theycame and they grabbed me by the neck. I thought they were just joking, but whenI looked I realised that it was quite a group. There were children, boys andgirls. They picked up stones. They were busy following us. We even went into another man's yard.The woman there chased us out of the yard. We didn't even know the people. Theykept on harassing us. They even pelted us with stones. They pelted me with astone on my right shoulder because I was trying to protect the gentleman withwhom I was going. As I was doing that the stone hit me on the ribs. I felt aterrible pain on the ribs. I tried to go on as if I wasn't feeling any pain.I tried to fight back, but they were busy pelting us with stones. At that timepolice appeared. They were driving the big kombi. What surprised me was thatthey didn't come to where we were, but they just went around the street, whichmeant they gave the Comrades a chance to run away. They chased them and theComrades ran away. I had fallen down at that stage, and the person I was withhad also fallen down. I dusted myself off and I was taken by the people whoknow me. I was taken home. When I got home I found that I wasn't feeling well,I couldn't breathe properly. My grandson heard. He took me in his car to thehospital. When I got to the hospital I spent a long time without being attendedto. By the time they came to me it was already in the afternoon on that Sunday.Then they took me to the x-rays. They just gave me tablets and said I must gohome, they'll see what to do with me. I was taken home. I slept at home. Thefollowing day I could not bear the pain. I couldn't breathe properly. My shoulderwas very painful. I came to Bloemfontein to see Dr Smith. He is the one whotried to help me. Because I did not have money I couldn't go back to be re-attended.Because of my ribs that were broken Dr Smith told me that had I delayed I couldhave died, but he helped me tremendously. So I went to him twiceand I got much help. I was supposed to have gone to him again but I could notafford to, because my health isn't quite well. Thereafter we were called tothe offices in Botshabelo. When we got there we found that it was a group ofpeople. There were attorneys from Bloemfontein. We couldn't discuss anythingbecause the ANC members asked that this case be dropped, and that the Dikwankwetlagroup shouldn't be assaulted. This matter ended unresolved. Thereafter I gota letter that said I should go to Botshabelo office. Then I went there. Thenthey asked me about this whole thing that took place. I explained it to them.That's where I'll end.",

I explained to themthat I was not a member of the ANC, I didn't even belong to any political organisation,but they nevertheless arrested me. They kept me in custody. Maybe they thoughtthat I was going to give a statement and explain to the Magistrate as to whatwas happening. On the very same day of the arrest, round about 12 midnight,two sergeants arrived. It was Mutsamayi and Marume. When they came they tookme, they put me into the back of the van, where there was a dog, and there wasalso a sack. They made this sack wet and they started assaulting me with it until they took me backto the charge office.

Just before the sun could rise I was on my way toschool, and I heard a knock at my door. When I opened the door I discoveredthat it was two policemen, and they pushed themselves into the room that I wasstaying in at Selosesha. I was a principal at a place called Kroondraai. Thepeople that are at Botshabelo presently were first living in Kroondraai. I hada few teachers assisting me. Those were the people who sacrificed a lot. I wasstaying in Selosesha and I had a small room. My original home is far. It's about40 miles from Tweefontein to that place. Now, every morning I would be preparingmyself to go to school. On that particular morning the police came in and theywanted my identity document. I gave them and they started searching the house,and they found a book called, \"Up from Slavery,\" that was written by T Washington,who was a principal at Etuski College(?). They took that book and they said,\"Get out of this house because you are a terrorist. You are teaching at a Kroondraaischool. What are you teaching those children? Are you teaching them terrorism?\"And they were behind me, coming - you know, pushing me, and they pushed me intoa big lorry that was parked there. I found many people in that truck, and theytook me to Selosesha Charge Office. I was accompanied by one policeman to thecharge office, and he said to the other policemen there, \"This is a person whohas been",

When the sun sets the police released me,they said, \"Go, but tomorrow you have to be here at 8 o'clock.\" I left the chargeoffice. They gave me my keys and my identity document, but they kept the bookwith them. The next morning before 8 o'clock I was at the charge office, andthey said to me, \"We are taking you, we are going to your place now,\" the placethat I have referred to which is 40 kilometres from Selosesha. The police said,\"You terrorist, we are taking you to your house, we are going to search.\" Wedrove until we reached my place. When we arrived there my wife was not at home,she went to the church meeting. Now, the person who was at home gave us thepermission to get in. It was a police officer and two other policemen. Theysearched the house. Together with our officer we were sitting in the lounge,but there was another room in which my two sons slept. The other one was attendingFort Hare University, and the other one was at Jordan High in Sebokeng. Andthey came out with something from that room. They said, \"Look at this.\" Theyhad Steve Biko's portrait. His hands were handcuffed. His hands were handcuffed,and they showed me the picture, they said, \"Look at this. It's from inside yourhouse.\" I said to them, \"I am from Thaba Nchu. My two sons sleep in that room.The other one is at Jordan High School, the other one is at Fort Hare. You pickedme up at my small shack from Thaba Nchu and you pushed me with your rifles,and  you are here to tell me that I know this Steve Biko photo.\"It was even my first time to hear the name Steve Biko. They showed me that photowith his hands handcuffed. That photo was taken from the room where my two sonswere sleeping, and I said to them, \"That is my sons' room.\" They asked me, \"Whichson? Which son can we associate with this photo?\" I said, \"I don't know.\" Andthey took one of his photos, they asked me, \"Who is this person the photo?\"I said, \"It's my son, and he is at Fort Hare University.\" They took that photo.Up to this day I have never received that photo.

You know, I was like a criminal. I was escortedinto her house. I don't know what could have happened if she was there. I thankGod she wasn't there. They took the photo, the Steve Biko photo with his handshandcuffed, and they took one of my son's photos. They said, \"This photo mustbelong to one of your two sons,\" and I said to them, \"I do not know whose photois that.\" The third point that they indicated was very bad. The Secretary tothe Bantu Education, that's where I complained. It was a letter because I wascomplaining. It was just a copy of the letter I wrote, and they had this copywith them. They said those were the three items that they found unacceptablein my house, Steve Biko's photo, the letter that I wrote to the Secretary ofBantu Education complaining.

We caught him at a place between Section C and Section W. Now, whilewe were passing a place called Simpowani - it was past seven to six, and thenwe heard a Hippo coming behind. And we did not run because we knew we were innocentbecause we only had this person in our company, we wanted to take him to theparents so that the parents can talk to him. The police arrived and they stopped.When they got out of their car they were pointing their guns at us. They askedwhat happened. We explained everything to them. They insulted us. They said,\"You Comrades, you've decided to take our jobs now. We are going to show you,\"and they threw us into the Hippo. We were so many, but we could all fit intothe Hippo. On our way we were trying to explain to them what happened, but theyassaulted us. They let us put our hands on the chair, and they took an emptybottle of cool drink and they started hitting us on the fingers. They had bottlesof beer in the Hippo and they were drinking. They took us to Section H. Thepolicemen on duty would take turns hitting us. We drove with them until we wentto the police station at Botshabelo C Section. The Hippo stopped. They couldn'tlet us out of the Hippo as normal people. They escorted us and they took theirguns and they hit us with the back of their guns. They took us into the policestation, and we thought that they would take us to the cells. No, they didn'ttake us to the cells, but they took us to a room called Room 13 ... (incomplete- end of Side B, Tape 8) ... to assault us. While standing against a wall theywould pull us. They continually assaulted us, tramping on our bodies, and theywere insulting us, telling us that our mothers are bitches and they will onlyfeel where they are asleep that we are in trouble. They took something and theystarted assaulting us with that. When we tried to stop they would use their heels to trample your hands, and I felt that it wasso heavy on me. They would let us stand up, and took our penis from behind andthey would hit us with something, and we couldn't identify. You can imagineyourself, you don't see this person assaulting you. I was clever enough to takea look at them, and at one stage they decided to take a look at us, and twoof the policemen were assaulting us. It was a violent area, and they have beenevicted from their houses, and I told them, I said, \"Please, can you pleasetake me home because I am not feeling well.\" It was to 12 in the evening, andI said to them, \"Take me home so that I can take my medication.\" I continuallyasked them, but they refused. But one of their surgeons came and said, \"Takethis gentleman home so that he can take his medication.\" They first took roundsin the township, and while doing that they were continually beating me, andthey didn't want to listen to anything I was trying to tell them. It was atnight and I couldn't identify the section. We drove past Simpowani again untilwe reached our section. You know, I wanted to run away. I said to myself, \"Shouldthey make mistake I am going to run away,\" but one of them said, \"If you cantry to run away we are going to shoot you.\" We had a dog at home, and I flutedso that my dog could realise it was me, and I got into the house, I took mytablets. They escorted me, but I could manage to write down a note. And I saidto them, \"Gentlemen, there is a key that my sister puts here,\" and I knew thatmy sister wakes up very early in the morning, and I took the key that I hadwith me, I put it on top of the note and I left it there. When I arrived atthe police station my friends were so badly assaulted. I remember one old man who was inour company. He wasn't actually our group member, but they hit him until heurinated on himself. Some of our officials from the choir were not arrested,and they managed to go home to report to our parents that we had been arrested.They went to the school to fetch my father. He went together with them to thepolice station, and we were told that we would write statements. My hand wasso swollen, and I said to them, \"Look what you have done to me.\" They said,\"We don't take care.\" We opened a case at the police station at Botshabelo,but we don't know what happened to those charges we laid.",

I am the eighth child.I am one of the persons who also got injured, or who got involved with whathappened to Mr Molehe. As he has already indicated I was belonging to the ANC,and I was a supporter thereof. I was in this gospel group when the two gentlemencame, and they wanted a girl, because she was going out with one of those twogentlemen. And we refused because we had - we had a rule. We didn't allow anybody - we didn't allow a girl or a boy to attend to hisprivate matters during the practice. Now, these two boys arrived and they werearmed. They were in a fighting spirit. And then we chased them until we werebetween the W Section and J Section, and we caught them just in the middle.We actually caught the innocent guy, because he was invited by his friend tocome and fight us. We left with this gentleman to the J Section. There's a placecalled Simporoneng. There's a factory called Rubex there, and a Hippo approachedus. And the police didn't ask anything. They just picked us up, they said, \"Comrades,\"and they pushed us into the Hippo. That's where we felt the pain. That's wherewe felt the pain, because they didn't want to listen to our story. I rememberthere was a cool drink bottle, and they used that to hit us on our backs. Theycontinued assaulting us. That was a group doing a night shift. When we arrivedat Section H there was a new shift coming in. This outgoing team told them,\"A group of Comrades belonging to Satan is here.\" It was after eight, I rememberwell. We left. From H we went to Botshabelo Police Station, and they had alreadystarted assaulting us. They first got out of the Hippo and they formed sortof a guard of honour, and when we got out of the Hippo we had to pass througheach one of them, and we didn't know where they were taking us to, we just sawourselves in an office. When we were in that office they said we should raiseour hands, we don't have to look them in the face. It was cold, it was in June.I remember very well they pulled us with our ankles and we could - then we fell.And every time you use your hands to protect yourself they would say, \"Comeon, start afresh.\"  And when they do this the second time, you know, the cementwas so cold. They ran, they trampled on us with their boots, and they would- and they said we were clean, they wanted to make us dirty. They used broomsticks.The first one broke, the second one broke, and they were busy trampling on us.If you tried to turn your head to take a look at them they would use their bootso that you can face down.

And the defence force has also played a verynegative role in our country, and it was used to support the work of the police,and to harass and assault people who opposed the policies of the Government,and this should never have been allowed to happen, and we must guard againstthat sort of thing ever happening again.\nAnd it's very ironic that in two short years the defence forcehas changed from being the sort of organisation that you have described, ithas changed, transformed into the sort of organisation which by and large isplaying a role in protecting and preserving our new democracy here. We fromKwaZulu-Natal have recently had our local government elections, and it was statedin the paper after those elections went off successfully that the defence forceplayed a very, very crucial role in ensuring that violence did not happen, sowe are certainly very glad that the defence force has managed to start transforming itself from the organisation it was when you weredetained and assaulted, to the sort of organisation that it is now.\nWe will try and investigate what happened to the cases thatyou initiated against the people who assaulted you, and we will try and findout who was responsible and why those things happened.

Where I was staying in Thaba Nchu each time I go to geta pass they would tell me that I am a Xhosa from Transkei. I asked them, \"Howcan I get to Transkei and get an identity document, because I wasn't born inTranskei?\" They told me I am a Xhosa, I should go back to Transkei. I was workingin Mafikeng. I went to Mafikeng to get an identity document. They referred meto Bloemfontein so that I could get my identity document there. In Bloemfonteinthey made me a temporary document. My ID took a long time. I went - I took thistemporary ID and went to look for work because I couldn't get any work. LuckilyI got work. It had already expired. I went on trying to change the date so thatit would be extended so that I could get some work. When I went to check ifmy ID had arrived they told me that I must go to the nearest South African town,which was Lichtenburg. I went to Lichtenburg. When I got to Lichtenburg, afterstanding in a long queue for my ID, when I got to the window I was balancingon the window as I am indicating. There was a black person at the counter. Heasked me what I was looking for. I told him I am looking for an ID. He justclosed the window without any care. He told me that I should see that it's lunchtime.

            "We were in transit in Dakawa. I had said that I wasgoing to a university, so we were waiting for scholarships. The others weregoing for training. It so happened that one day when I got to Dakawa I had aproblem with the ANC alliance as well as the South African Communist Party.When I encountered this problem I approached the authorities. I had made a decisionthat I wouldn't be able to be a member of ANC because of its alliance with theSouth African Communist Party. When I got to this authority, who was a Pioneer,he was a security. The security was dealing with everything that was happeningthere. I told him my problem, then he called all the others, as well as theco-ordinator of the transit camp. They sat down. They said I should explainmy case. I went on to explain, and I told them that I had joined the AfricanNational Congress, but I learned later on that it had an alliance with the South African Communist Party, andaccording to my beliefs I don't go along with that, so I felt I should resignfrom the South African National Congress. They told me that they would callme later on, but that I knew what was happening so I wasn't supposed to communicateit to anyone else. I told them that I knew it because that is why I had approachedthem. So I went back. A day thereafter somebody came to me. I was called tothe office once more. I went. He introduced himself as Nthu. Nthu was a securityfrom Mazimbo. He said to me I should relate that - I felt I should resign fromthe African National Congress. They persuaded me that I should not resign, becauseif I resign life is going to be tough for me in Tanzania as a refugee. So theydidn't want to see people from South Africa suffering in Tanzania. I said Idon't know about that, but it's going to be difficult for me to go on in somethingthat I don't believe in. They said to me I should go and rethink the matterover, then they would call me once more. I should go and sleep over it. Fromthat day on I observed something that wherever I was going there was alwayssurveillance. Whether I was going to the bush or whether I was going to relievemyself there was always somebody watching me. I approached the security to findout what was going on. He told me there was nothing going on, and he asked mewhy should I ask such a question. Then I left him alone. Nthu came back. Thenthey asked me what was my decision. I told them that I had made the final decision.They left me alone, they never said anything, then they went. I stayed therewithout encountering any problem. Life was normal. Then it so happened - I think it was - I am not sure about the times at which this happened.It was in August. We were taken in buses from Dakawa to Mazimbo. At that timethe then President of the African National Congress, Oliver Thambo, was coming,so we were going to meet him. He was going to address us. Everybody was happy.I was also happy too, because it was going to be my first time to see a manwho had been referred by the boers as a terrorist or somebody who was abominable.I was happy to go and see him. When we got to Mazimbo there were a lot of people.Mazimbo is just outside Morogoro. The place was full. We had come to see thePresident. Our bus arrived a little bit late when he was about to finish hisspeech, so we were standing at the far end. We couldn't see him properly. Atthe time that he was leaving, when he was getting into his car, everybody triedto rush and have a glimpse of the President. Where I was standing, when I movedon to get a glimpse of the President I felt somebody pulling me from the back.When I looked I saw a Pioneer. He asked me where I was going. I said I wantedto see the President. He said I mustn't do that. He said just like that. ThenI said what did he mean. He said to me I shouldn't do it. I didn't understandwhat he meant. By that time people were getting into their cars. He got intohis car. The convoy left. We got into our buses. I was very troubled by thePioneer's behaviour. I was asking myself as to what was happening. We went backto Dakawa. Life just went on as normal. Nthu paid me regular visits, but hewasn't saying anything in particular. We stayed there until December, if I rememberwell. It happened that we went out with other Comrades to a village. So we wentto that village. We came back a little bit late. When we got therewe found that the supper had already been eaten, but we couldn't get any supper.When we got back we were so hungry. I decided to go to the dining hall. WhenI got to the dining hall I went to the logistics and I spoke to one ComradeKenny Rogers. I told him that I was hungry, please organise me something. Weknow that we are late. He started talking funny language, then he asked me whosent us out, we are not going to get any food. He further told us that therewas food, but we weren't going to get it. I pleaded with him to give us somefood. He told us that he wanted us to feel that he was the boss in the logistics.He was in charge and he could do anything, and there was absolutely nothingwe do about that. We kept on begging him. Comrade kept on talking and we feltvery disturbed by what he was saying. I started answering him. I told him, \"Thisis not your food, this is the ANC food, so we want the food so you must givethe food to us.\"",

He took me to the admin block. When I got there he said I should sitdown, he is coming back. He went away, then he came back with Nthu, as wellas two others, or three. They closed the door behind them. They told me that,\"You are going to tell us who you are.\" I asked them what they meant. They toldme that I am going to tell them who I really am. They took out some rods, somevery heavy rods. They told me to sit down flat. They started assaulting me,and they started hitting me with fists, and I fell down, and they told me tosit down. They started using these rods, hitting me on the whole body. Theywere telling me I should tell them who I am, what was happening? I was causingconfusion, and why was I causing the confusion? I asked them what confusionI was causing because I was merely asking for food. They kept on kicking me,they kept on trampling on me. I started bleeding through the nose, as well asthe ears. They kept on assaulting me, and they told me that I am going to tellthem who I really am. I asked them why they were doing this to me. They couldn'tunderstand, they kept on assaulting me. They assaulted me throughout, kickingme, using these rods. They were also trampling on me, and I was bleeding atthat time, and I was lying flat on the floor and I kept on pleading with them.From there they told me that I am going to tell them who sent me to the ANC.They told me that I was going to tell them. They continued assaulting me. WhenI had fallen down and I couldn't stand they stopped assaulting me momentarily.They kept on repeating the very same thing, that I was going to tell them. Oneof them came back. They dragged me on the floor, dragged me through the doorand out. I don't know where my shoes ended, but they dragged me. There'san engine room. They put me inside the engine room. They put me in there, theyshut the door behind them. It was late at night. The place was full of greasebecause there was an engine. I was dizzy at that time, I didn't know what washappening. Later on they switched the engine off. After some time I felt like- I was asking myself why should this happen to me, and I was beginning to suffocate.I was able to break the door and I went out. When I went out I proceeded tothe tent where I was staying. When I got there I was asking myself why I wasassaulted. Then I decided to go and report them. I went to Mazimbo to reportthem. When I got into my tent I was walking on foot, I didn't have any shoes,so there were boots in my tent that we were using to work there. I took my boots,I put them on, then I decided I was going to Mazimbo to report the police, becausethey said they are going to assault me. I went there to the village. When Igot to the village I couldn't walk properly. I got another man at Mazimbo village.He gave me headache tablets, he told me to rest a little bit. I think I stayedthere for about three days, sleeping there. The other thing that they did wasthey had assaulted me or hit me underneath my feet with these rods, so it wasdifficult for me to walk. But after about three days it was fine, then I wasable to go to Mazimbo. When I got to the gate in Mazimbo I got some Tanzanians.They called them FF. They asked me where my permit was. I told them I didn'thave it. They said I couldn't get in. I asked them to call a certain guy forme who was in there. I told them I didn't have permit but I wanted to see him.I tried to speak to them but they just couldn't understand. When theyspeak to you and you don't respond they always take action, so I went away,I left them alone. I went back. On my way back to Dakawa I thought that thepeople were going to assault me so I turned back. I waited at the bus stop.I was waiting for a bus. As I was waiting there I saw a car. I stopped the carthat belonged to the ANC. Fortunately it was Nthu. I climbed into the car. Thenhe told me that they said they didn't know where I had gone to. I told him whathad happened. Nthu took me to Morogoro. When we got to Morogoro he left me inanother house. I stayed and he left. Then there came two Comrades. One of themwas P4, the other one I don't know, I don't know his name. They took me. Wewent to the office of the ANC. When we got in there they put me in another room.I sat there all by myself. Then they came back and took me out of that room.When I got into the room there were people, Comrades, sitting there, quite anumber of them. I don't remember how many they were. When I got in there P4indicated and said, \"Here is this man. He is going to tell us today who he is,what he wants, why is he causing so much confusion.\" I was dumbfounded, I justdidn't know how to respond. They took me to another room, where they said Imust sit down on the floor. As I sat on the floor P4 came to me holding knobkerriesas well as sjamboks. There came another five. They said I must put my handsinside my thighs. They kept on assaulting me then. I was kicked and assaulted.I kept on begging them, I kept on urging them to spare me, but they kept ontelling me that I should disclose the identity of the person who sent me tothe ANC. They kept on assaulting me. I was already bleeding through the nose.They kept on kicking ... (incomplete - end of Side A, Tape 9) ... assaultingme on my whole body, kicking me all over. I told them that I will tell themwho sent me. They said I must tell them. I told them that I didn't know whatthey were talking about. They started once more to assault me. They assaultedme and I told them that I would tell them. They said who sent me? I said Mulemehad sent me.

They took me into another room. Theysaid I am going to give them full details as to why I was causing confusion in Tanzania, andwho sent me to create such confusion in the ANC. I pleaded with them. I kepton asking them. I told them that I didn't know anything about that. I told themthat I had actually made a false statement due to being threatened. Then therecame another hefty guy. His name was James. They called him Dada because hewas the head of the security there. He told me that whatever they did to mewasn't the real thing, the real thing was coming to me. He said to me I mustlook behind me. I saw knobkerries, sjamboks. They indicated that I could seethem. I also saw spears, and they told me if I didn't want to talk they wouldsort me out. They left me there and they told me that they were coming back,and when they came back I should be very prepared to make a statement. Theywent away and they left me inside the room. As I was sitting there I realisedthat these people may kill me. The person I was left with probably is the onewho was keeping guard on me. I realised that he was a bit intoxicated. I realisedthat here I can escape. When we were coming I realised that the main road wasn'tvery far from where we were, and I had seen an office of UNH, so I told myselfthat when I leave there I am going to the UNHCR office to ask for assistance.I went out, I went down the street until I got to the office of UNHCR. Theyasked me what I wanted. I told them that I wanted the High Commissioner forRefugees. They told me to sit. Thereafter they took me and put me into anotheroffice, where another woman came in, a white woman. If I am not mistaken I thinkshe introduced herself as Mrs Zulu or Mrs Phiri, one of the two, I don'tremember quite well.  Then she told me she is the High Commissioner for Refugees,then she sat down. I explained to her the hardships that I gone through fromTanzania up to Zambia, and these people were threatening to kill me. I urgedher to assist me because whatever they were alleging wasn't true, I knew nothingof it. So I urged her to speak to them because I knew nothing about the allegations.She told me about a certain brigadier that I should go to who was in Lusaka.Then I said these people were going to meet me along the way and they were goingto assault me. Then she told me she was coming. She said I should wait. I wentto the reception. I waited for quite a long time, then she called me in. Shesaid to me she was going to attend to me, I should go out side and sign andshe will say that they should call me. I stood outside the building, just nextto the door. As I was standing there, it wasn't a long time, a car just camein speeding through the gate. It went straight - it came straight to me. Atthat time they opened the doors and I realised these were the people. They pulledme and put me inside the car. They said I thought I was clever, I am going tothe United Nations and to all those places, and the people had told them thatI was there. They took me, put me inside the car. They said they were goingto teach me a lesson. They took me back to Rest Two. When we got to Rest Twothey put me in a room. They started assaulting me, and they assaulted me upto such an extent that I couldn't stand. They left me. When they left me therethere were other rooms just behind. They took me, they put me in one of therooms. Those rooms looked like cells. I stayed there locked up in there untilwe went out of Zambia and went to Angola.",

I had no senseof balance whatsoever, I was falling all over the place, and they would makeme stand erect. They kept on assaulting me. When I fell down they ceased assaultingme.

Thank you for being patient and having waited all day to give this story.It's clearly a story that you needed to tell very badly, and we are glad tohear it. It is a sad story, and it is sad that you, having left the countrywith such enthusiasm, should have returned a disillusioned and a sick personas a result of what happened to you, and it seems to me that your life has changedsubstantially as a result of that decision that you took to go into exile. Thosethings should never have happened to you, particularly at the hands of an organisationwhich has always had such strong views about that sort of arbitrary violence.\nI note from what you said in your evidence that you have rejoinedthe ANC, and it does indicate that there is some reconciliation between youand that party, and we can certainly continue a mediation process between yourselfand the ANC if you wish. We can arrange that for you. Furthermore, if you requiretreatment, further medical treatment - I note that you are getting treatmentfrom the Botshabelo Health Clinic. If you are not satisfied with that treatment you may be able to get treatment through theroute that we have organised with the Ministry of Health here in Bloemfontein.\nSo thank you once again for coming in and for telling us yourstory, and we wish you well.
