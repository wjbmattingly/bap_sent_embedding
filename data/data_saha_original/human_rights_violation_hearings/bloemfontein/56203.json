            "Thank you. You may now proceed and tell us what happened onthis - in 1986 when your brother had to suffer the tortures and the injuries.--- He was arrested in 1986. I don't remember the month, whether it was Aprilor May, because he wasn't staying with me. The person who was staying with himcame to tell us that he had been arrested and taken by the police in Ladybrand,but even the Bophutatswana Police were involved. Then he said I should go andsee where he stays. I went there. The ceilings were torn apart and put downbecause he was suspected that he had kept guns in the ceilings. When this boycame to tell us that he had been arrested I went there to see. I discoveredthat the ceilings were torn down. He told me that the manner in which they hadassaulted him he doubted whether he was living or not. I went to look for himat the Bophutatswana Police quarters. They told me that they didn't know anything,they were not the ones who arrested him. We kept on searching for him without any success. We went to different prisons without anysuccess. One policeman told me, but he said we shouldn't tell anybody what hewas about to tell us because he would lose his job. We went to Ladybrand withthe policeman's wife. When we got to Ladybrand I asked as to whether there wasany person. The policemen there denied and told us that he was not there. Idon't remember the name of the policeman I spoke to. We waited there. They phoneda white policeman to come. When he got there he asked me what I was lookingfor there. I told him I was looking for my brother, the police in Bophutatswanahad told us that he is in Ladybrand. But the policemen in Bophutatswana hadnot told us that, I just believed that if I said it he would actually help me.He told me that he had no knowledge of such a person. After a moment he saidI should produce my identity document, and my brother's wife should take outher identity document. He asked us whether we were the ones who sent him tobe a communist. We denied, and we said we were just looking for him becauseit was three months now since he disappeared. As he was still holding my identitydocument he told me that he knows me very well. He said it in Afrikaans, andhe said, \"I know you. I know where you are staying, you black.\" He said he couldarrest me. I asked him why would he arrest me. He told me that I was harbouringcommunists in my house. I told him that, \"You are accusing me, and yet my brotheris not here. How can you accuse me if you say the person you - you didn't arrestthe person?\" I said to him he can arrest me if he wanted. We argued until hethrew us with our identity documents and told us to leave the place. When wewere going out there was a policeman who was sitting at the securitygate. He looked more like a coloured. He told me that my brother is there inLadybrand, but he is not supposed to talk because he was going to lose his job.He told me that he had been severely assaulted and they won't show him to me.We went back home. I kept on pestering him and they kept on denying it. Sixmonths lapsed without us knowing the whereabouts of my brother. I kept on pesteringthe Bophutatswana Police to tell me where my brother was, and they denied knowinghis whereabouts. They told me they would not help me look for my brother, Imust do it on my own, because they were not the ones who arrested him. One daywe saw him coming. He had signs that indicated that he had been assaulted. Hehad scars. We asked him where he had been. He told me that he had always beenthere, and he had always been assaulted, and he further indicated that the policemenhad told him that we were looking for him. He was always taken regularly atnight to Kroonstad. They said he should reveal the whereabouts of other communistsfrom the ANC. They took him to Lesotho. He said at times along these travelsthey would assault him along the way to Kroonstad. At times they would takepliers, a pair of pliers, and they would squeeze his private parts, his penis,that he should speak the truth. He should also say if we as a family are involvedin this. On the first day that he arrived he started having fits. He was emittingsome white substance from - through his mouth, and he collapsed. We thoughtmaybe he was excited, he was relieved that he had arrived finally at home. Werealised that he had been mentally affected. He kept on having these attacks.The doctor said that there was a clot in his brain. He was taken for treatmentfor fits. He even had high blood pressure until he suffered a stroke. As I amspeaking now he can't do anything, he's a human cabbage. He can't speak properly.I had asked the hospital if I could not take him so that you can see him, butdue to his conditions I could not bring him with. His mother is 80 years oldthis year. She is staying with his children. She is a pensioner. She is goingthrough a lot of hardships.",

I found myself lying flat on the ground.I crawled. There were no people there. I saw the fire extinguishers, and thefiremen took me to the hospital. I was taken to General Hospital in Johannesburg.I stayed there for a week. After about three days it's only then that I regainedconsciousness and I was told what had happened. I was told that they would haveto amputate my leg. Then I had to sign. I refused to sign the document becauseI said I didn't know who signed for the first leg to be amputated. Then theyleft me. I stayed two weeks. On the third week they gave me - they transferredme to Roodepoort Hospital. I stayed for three months. As I was still there theother people with whom I was injured came. I asked if they had openeda case. They told me they hadn't yet started, but they will be notified later.Since then nothing has happened until I was discharged. I went to make a statement.They refused. They said I was limping so I couldn't come to them. I went therethree times. Each time I was using my own money, and each time they were refusingto take a statement from me. Until I went to Johannesburg to seek some help.At Johannesburg they phoned them. They came and asked me who were phoning them.I said I didn't know, it's the people I went to for help. They said to me theywere phoned by certain people who said I didn't want to make a statement. Iended up making the statement. I requested the case number. They asked me whotold me that they would give me the case number. I said I wanted it on my ownaccord. They took the statement and went away, and nothing came out of it. Theyasked me whether I knew that I had to be paid for being injured. I said thehotel should be responsible for the payment, it's the law. They left me then.My boss at that time told me that I would have to leave my work. I asked himwhy would I do so. They said I wouldn't be able to discharge my duties. I toldthem to pay me for all the 12 years that I have worked there. They told me Iwasn't going to get any money.

When we left we left together with my friend,as well as the fourth one. We were with another gentleman who is staying oppositemy place. We went when the disco closed during the night. When we got at thegate in Nalethi Sun we were accosted by two policemen in a police van. They asked us where we were off to. They saidwe should get into the van. One of them opened up the van and they said we shouldget into the back of the van. The others were put at the front. We were goingto Mokwena. We went to another police station in town. The van got into theyard. Two policemen got off the van. They left us in the van. They came backwith some sjamboks. They opened the door of the van. They also opened for thethree girls who were at the front of the van. They started assaulting us. Westarted running. We were scattered as we were running. There was a new roadthat was being erected that was under construction. They accosted me and theytook me and put me inside the van. They took me for about 30 minutes. When theyarrested me there was a gentleman who was knocking off from his duty. They tookhim together with me. They drove for quite some distance. We didn't see wherewe were going to. We went to the police station. They took us into the chargeoffice. Only one got into the charge office with us, the other one was leftin the van. They asked this gentleman whether he was with us. He said no, hewas from work. They asked me where my friends were. I said I don't know, becauseI didn't see where they were headed to when we were running. There was anotherfemale ... (incomplete - end of Side B, Tape 12) ... me with an object on thehead, and I fell. They started kicking me. As they were kicking me and assaultingme they were asking me questions as to whether I knew where my friends werestaying. When I tried to answer them they kept on assaulting me. They even askedme where I attended school. They told me that I had come to teach the ThabaNchu children about politics. They kicked me even in the ribs. I couldn't breatheat that stage and I lost consciousness. I only regained my consciousness whenthey were taking me to the tap and they opened some water. It was very coldand the water was cold. They put my head under the tap. I sort of regained consciousness.They started kicking me once more, and they chased me, they said I must fuckoff. The gates were locked, I couldn't get out. Two of them came to me. Whenthe other one was trying to open the gate the other one was assaulting me, andI couldn't run. As I was on the way, I wasn't very far away from the policestation, they drove towards me. There was this girl in the van, and I was walkingvery slowly. They got out and they further assaulted me. I fell on the new roadthat was under construction. They left me there. I struggled to stand up andwalk. I couldn't even see because my eyes were swollen. I could only see throughmy left eye. I got to a certain house. It was round about past six in the morning.I told them at home that I had been assaulted by police. As I was still explainingand relating this story one of the girls came in and asked me how I got home.I was so swollen I couldn't speak. They took me - they took me to the hospital.As we were at the hospital my mother went to fetch some forms at the policestation, because the doctor wanted to fill the forms in so that I could be ableto open up a case. They refused to give my mother the forms. The following dayon a Monday I went there. There was another girl who was also involved. Whenthey asked where this other girl was nobody knew where she had gone to. I wasultimately able to get the forms. I took them to the doctor, the doctor filled them in. I took them to the police station. They didn'twant to take the forms, they said I must bring all the people who were involved.On Monday - that was only on Monday when they released that other girl, andshe went on Tuesday. We all went to make some statements. They said they weregoing to let us know as to when the case will be heard. I was never notified.A month lapsed. After about a month there came another policeman.

You were the last person to give evidence today, you've waitedthe whole day. And thank you for reliving those events of six years ago.
