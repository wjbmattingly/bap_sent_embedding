            "Actually in our family there were 11 and Andrew was the 4th and the 6th.  It was in 1976, during that time he was not at school.  We had a school, but he wasn't there.  He didn't like school.  One day, I can't remember the date, but we were coming back from school. Our parents were working.  They were not at home when we came home from\nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 H N NGCOBO\nschool.  My mother was around asking for him, going even to the police station, going even to his friends' houses.  They could not find him. No one came to report at home.  \n After a very long time, the police came who were from Protea police station.  They came with his ID photo.  They said we are looking for your child, he is in Tanzania, he joined the terrorist organisation. We didn't know by then, we couldn't believe them.  During that time they started harassing us, they used to come to visit us at home.\n In 1978 or 1974, they phoned - it was the first phone call we received from him, he was phoning from Swaziland.  He was phoning from Swaziland and he said to us he is still alive, he is in Swaziland.  We were very excited at home.  All of us wanted to speak with him.  \n One lady from Swaziland came home after some days.  She is Eunice Gilinsa.  She said she is staying with him in Swaziland. She was coming to collect clothes and money.  We wrote a letter. We realised that this was not ready.  We gave the clothes, we gave the money, we gave her our photos and she went back to Swaziland.  \n He phoned.  His friend said he had received all the materials.  He used to phone us.  One day, after a call, the police came from Protea police station and said the terrorist called.  They said when he phoned they used to tape it at home.  When we called him it went to Protea police station immediately and the police will come.  All the time he used to phone us and police used to come daily.\n In 1984, I think it was in December, after having called us from Swaziland.  He stayed for a long time without him phoning us, even the lady was not phoning.  People used to come at home, who were not familiar to us, they were \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 H N NGCOBO\nstrangers.  Some of them were working at (indistinct).  They used to ask us funny questions.  The police would during the night, sometimes during the day.\n In 1994, on the 16th of December, we read in the Sunday newspaper, in 1984, I'm sorry, it is 1984, in December 16th, we read in the Sunday paper.  We heard it in Lesotho, we listened to the radio, the news, it was in the evening news.  We were watching television. They said he was coming from this family who was short in Swaziland.  \n My mother died in 1984.  She was a person who was eager to know what happened to my son, who sent the people to kill him in Swaziland.  Because she knew that she joined the ANC.\n I want to ask the Commission who killed my son, why, what did he do.  \n We went to Swaziland. It was my father, my mother and Chris, my brother.  We went there to fetch his corpse.  We were not allowed, firstly, because it was late and then they came back to South Africa.  They went back again on the 29th of December 1974(?) to Swaziland.  They found that he was not in the mortuary shelves. He was rotten, he was put in a plastic, the plastic which (indistinct).  My father came back home and my mother was left in Swaziland.  They went to the police station and the police said they will go with them and they are going to make (indistinct).\n They went to Swaziland and they agreed that the body should be brought back to South Africa.  We buried him.  We heard through rumours, and we are not sure, we heard when Eunice came to the funeral and she said they have children in Swaziland who are twins.  She went back to Swaziland without explaining to us properly.\n We ask this Commission to, because we don't know \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 H N NGCOBO\nwhether there are twins. We just heard there are twins.  We want the Commission to look for us.",

If a person comes to our house, the police will come to our house and say that they saw a terrorist coming to our home, even if the person was just maybe coming to our home to visit us.
