            "Firstly, my name is Luthando Dyasop.  I am originally from Umtata in the Transkei or former Transkei. I had done my education up to matric, that is in 1976, but I must say that when I went to school, I was more interested in education and I myself, I must say that I am an artist.  Something which is in the family, I must say. My father taught me art and I have always loved art.  When I went to school, it was for the love of education.  But then my father wanted me to be somebody. I shouldn't an artist like he was, I should be somebody, maybe a teacher, a clerk, but I was not interested in that.  But then I had to get something, a career. Then I got interested in architecture.   Then came 1976, I was doing my matric.  Of course there were the June 1976 riots, which influenced the whole country.  In Transkei, Transkei has been a place that has been, people have been politically motivated even prior to 1976.  In our local schools there used to be from time to time, schools like St Johns, there would be strives, which were politically motivated, and as you know, even the now President comes from that side. People who had been politically, been inclined sort of or ...\n So when 1976 came, I wanted, I knew that after my matric I had to do this architecture, but then I found\nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 L DYASOP\nthat architecture was not, there was no faculty for Black people in South Africa, for architecture.\n Now this really disappointed me and I wasn't going to change maybe to be a clerk or a teacher or really I got frustrated.  So I used to help my father, as he is a painter, would go painting around Umtata, even outside the Transkei, we will be moving around with my father.\n Until of course, some people whom I later realised to be ANC people, I befriended these people.  We got more and more political.  That was from 1976.  When I failed my matric in 1976, and when I repeated it in 1977 I knew that my mind was not there. So I soon, I just dropped out from matric in 1977 and later well, I just decided that I should go to exile and join the ANC.\n Of course, there was the raid of freedom, which was also encouraging us to join the liberation movements.  So in 1980 I left for Lesotho. I arrived in Carters Neck(?) in November, the 2nd. I was kept in that Carters Neck police station and whilst they were still connecting with the UN. Then I was in the 14th of November, I was transferred to Maseru.  Where I could have a chance to join the ANC and the MKs.  \n Well, Lesotho was a different passage as opposed to others like Swaziland and Botswana. People like there stayed longer than these other countries. In Lesotho I stayed from that November until September 1981.  That's when I left for Maputo where I didn't stay long and then I went further to Luanda, back to Angola. \n On December 17th 1981 I got my military training in Gamanlondi training camp.  We were later transferred to Quaqualama.  We opened this camp Qquaqualam in February 1982 SOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 L DYASOP\nand our military, our course was suspended for some weeks.\nThen it was resumed later.  After we had finished our course, around July 1982, I was taken to Quashito camp, also in Angola.  This Quashito camp is where people are prepared. They get their last preparations before they can infiltrate inside the country.\n I regarded myself very lucky to get the opportunity to come and fulfil my dream of fighting for my country.  But then there in Quashito I was to specialise in an anti-air gun, called Straler 2M.  So we got these instructors from the Soviet Union.  The course was supposed to be six months.  We did that six months and then we have some revision.  After that revision, well, there was a bit of a lull.  Then in August 1983 we were taken from Quashito.  In my group that was doing this Straler 2M was 16. By the time we were 15, because our commander was ill.\n The 15 of us were taken wholesome to the Eastern front. We were not briefed where we were going.  I thought I was coming back to South Africa to fight, but then we were taken to this Eastern front and I was there with my group, we were in this group called Kagiso.  \n In Kagiso we stayed. Of course it was a relief for some, for most members in the MK, who had been languishing in the bush, doing nothing.  Now having that chance, at least, to be within the community, to learn the beauties of some Portuguese and to have some experience.  Because that was the main thing that we were told, that we were going to this Eastern front to get some experience. It will be a matter of some three months, we get this experience, then we can use that experience here in South Africa.\n So we were fighting against Unita of Savimbi.  Now \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 L DYASOP\nNow as I have said, it was a relief to most of us, but then the reality was that we were fighting a war with people who were also fighting.  So when we got some casualties - our first casualty was when we were ambushed and the one comrade whose name was Caroline, died in that ambush.  What followed was that it was a hot pursuit after those who had ambushed our trucks, in which Caroline died.  \n Now one thing I must highlight is that we were fighting people who were guerillas, and we were also guerillas. We were not taught in counter-insurgency.  Having never been taught in counter-insurgency, we were not even assisted by the Government of Angola, because they had trucks, they had bigger guns, they had all the facilities, but we did this on our own.  \n Of course we were fighting alongside some locals who were not trained. They just got this crash course which would last some three weeks, then they will be handed an AK and we were to fight alongside such upstarts.\n All right.  Now the reality was that we were fighting and when we suffered these casualties and we made this hot pursuit, and we found out that Unita, Unita's strategy was to terrorise the people and capture them. They didn't mind capturing the whole village, and they would leave the old people, old people who cannot help them.  Then they take the young ones, together with food and they would go along with them, take them to the bush and train them.  \n Now we did our best and now on that hot pursuit, we arrested a lot of people, more especially people in whose villages we found our team staff which had been captured in that ambush.\n Now I must say that in trying to get evidence from \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n6 L DYASOP\nthese people, some of us got harsh on these local people.  To the extent that these people knew, the locals now tended to have a negative attitude towards us.\n Now these people are not well-educated people.  They know that we are from South Africa and they know that in the south the South Africans are killing their brothers.  They said to us but you say you are fighting against the racists in South Africa, but how come now you kill our own people, and yet the racists down south are killing our people.\n There was some disillusionment from the side of the Angolans, they did not want to co-operate with us, and now this was becoming dangerous for us, for our own safety.\n For instance, they didn't mind at the post, at the guard post, just to put the AK there and sleep this side, so that if Unita comes, the Unita can just take his AK and leave him alone.\n This was the case and what happened is that we continued with some missions, because one thing that we were told, is that we were to defend the capital of Malanga province, which is Malange, and Unita was aiming to capture the Malange province.  So we were a buffer between them and Malange.  Sokikosa was strategically a place where, a place which we ... (TAPE 1 - SIDE B).\n ... trying to trace now the Unita rebels, trace from their bases, because we had gathered information that they were across the river, the river Quanla.",

Okay, I will try to be brief and I don't\nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n7 L DYASOP\nknow whether you will understand. \n So I can say, what later transpired is that we got disillusioned of the whole Eastern front.  We said we have been told that we are going to be here for some three months and now we are dying.  That is around, after December, when some of us got, who were in an ambush, we were ambushed and there were six people who died there.  So we said no, we are dying here, why can't we go and die at home, rather than dying here in Angola.  Because that was the time when even Sebe and Umtanzani was killing people and so we felt rather use - we were fighting a useless, we were protecting, defending a country whose people were not supporting us.\n Now of course, one thing led to the next.  When we found out that our organisation for a long time has not been holding a conference, a national conference, where leaders can be elected democratically, it was something that was lax in 1969, the Morogo Conference.\n So we said let us, we were so concerned about our organisation and about the whole liberation, and I am not talking about me alone, I am talking about almost 99% of the people who were in Angola at the time.\n Now I am coming to how I got, myself got into Quattro.\n Now we demanded that we be withdrawn from this Eastern front, back to Luanda, where we can settle everything.  When we got to Luanda, our administrators in the Luanda camp, that is in Vienna, demanded that we should disarm.  We said no, we cannot disarm because we know that the security of the ANC and us are not on good books.",

            "Because I want to take you step by step so that you can understand how I got to Quattro. But okay, I am saying now, we were in this Vienna camp and we were ordered to disarm, and we disagreed. We said no, we won't kill anybody, this is for our security and the security of the ANC had said, had labelled us as mutineers.  We knew that being labelled as mutineers, is tantamount to being - the next thing we will be sentenced to death.  That is something which we knew.  Something we knew, we had been told of.\n Now we kept our weapons to us, with us.  Until of course many things happened, whilst we were there.  For instance, the administration said we should elect 10 people who will represent our grievances and all like.  We elected those 10 people and they forwarded our grievances.  But then we never dropped our guard, we were always careful.\n What happened is that on the 12th of February 1984, there was a pre-dawn raid on our camp by the presidential guard.  Now when we got to this Vienna camp, because we were so many, some of us said occupy positions around this Vienna camp.  We had some positions, we had our bivouac there. Now I was asleep in my bivouac on that dawn, when I heard a combat bell \"gang, gang, gang, gang\", which means in \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n9 L DYASOP\nmilitary language that we are being attacked.  I woke up and I could hear some fire.  All I did was to take my bazooka and my shells and my AK and I had around 500 to 600 rounds of ammunition and I ran - I didn't know what was happening, it was still dark, I was just running towards the trench, the nearest trench. I found that I was amongst the people who were related to wake-up.  So I thought it best that I should run to the nearest trench.  When I got to this trench there were another four people there.  Four comrades.  I thought the enemy would come from this side, so I was - we were just across the parapet, but then we find that the enemy was not coming from outside, it was coming from within. Although we had to aim now, we had to aim our guns and face whoever this enemy was.  We didn't know who the enemy was at the time.\n Then I could see that there were some armoured vehicles coming in and dropping soldiers, soldiers who - no, when they came, this was our Vienna camp and these soldiers were forming a skirmish around our Vienna camp.  Little did they imagine that they were encircled by us.  Because we were outside their own settlement.  So they were themselves encircled.\n So from my trench there was this APC, which was around 20 to 25 metres from our trench.  It was a trench to us.  Now at the time it was still dark, they didn't know, they didn't see.  They were only facing, they had their backs to us.  If we would have liked, we could have killed them, but we didn't want to, because we didn't know what was happening.  Until the sun rose from the east and they were getting tired, they didn't know what was happening.  Similarly they had gone inside the camp and found nobody, \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n10 L DYASOP\nonly a few people who were there.  \n Now they were surprised, where are these hundreds, and now they were getting impatient.  Now the driver of this APC climbed onto the top of the APC. He opened this flip-top and climbed on top, still with his back to us, still facing the camp.  But now when the sun rose, he got less interested in his target and he got interested in the beauty of the nature.  That's when he came slowly, just looking how beautiful the nature was and I knew that we were going to be in problems, once they spotted us.  And he did spot us. And when he spotted us, he jumped inside the APC, opened the side door and called the commander who was down the skirmish and said hey, here are these people. \n When the commander saw us, he came rushing and he said hey, come out of the trench. He was speaking in Portuguese, come out of that trench or I will kill you now.  We said but why, tell us why, what do you want here.   This commander was so impatient, he didn't even realise that we had our gains trained on them. He took out his grenade and he was about to throw it into the trench, and I imagined what would follow if that grenade landed in the trench.  What would follow would be our inevitable end.\n So what I did, with my bazooka, I pulled the trigger, aimed at the APC and I shot that APC.  When I shot that APC the sound that was emanated by the bazooka was the sound that disturbed this commander.  So he couldn't throw it at his own wheel. He was only letting go of it. It exploded some three or five metres from my trench.\n What happened is that my comrades assisted with fire power, their power, their fire power, but we were not aiming at these people, they were only aiming above their heads.  \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n11 L DYASOP\nWe were only scaring them away.  They ran helter-skelter towards the camp, towards the Vienna camp.  By the time this driver of the APC was trying to turn the APC towards our trench.  I had to realise that APC, and with the rest of my shells I shot that APC. I am made to understand the driver died. But I will be saving these other lives with my life too.  Successfully I saved those lives. They are alive now, happily with their families. I didn't know that that was going to be my scene.  Having saved those people, I didn't know, hardly you can imagine that it was going to change my whole life till today.",

So they realised that we had stopped our fire, they came and they shot at us.  We were just lucky, because these people were really shooting at us, aiming at us.  Those bullets were whizzing like this, past us. We managed to get to the trench. When we managed to get to that trench, it was then that the rest of these Fapla forces, that they realised that they were themselves encircled.  My other comrades had their guns also levelled at them.\n Now these others realised that they were going to die.  They said no, no, no, comrades, comrades, please don't shoot at us.  Now it was now going to be, we were now going to negotiate why people, why did you come here to kill. \n One other thing I must mention is that when they came, those shots that I heard, really, they were aimed at us, and one comrade died, that comrade Bugsy died.  So I, when I was shooting at that APC, I wasn't the one, the first one who \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n12 L DYASOP\nwas shooting.  They had themselves shot and they had killed. So it was a war situation.  Like I said, little did I imagine that I would end up in Quattro.\n So in short, that was the reason why I ended up in Quattro.  But let me just detail, continue, because what happened is that they didn't know who had shot the APC.  What they did, they arrested somebody else. I don't know why they, my own comrades wanted to arrest us, us.  Instead of arresting the Fapla forces who had come shooting and killing our own comrades, but they were prepared to arrest us, to arrest me.  Though they didn't arrest me, they arrested somebody else.\n Now so I escaped arrest, I escaped immediate arrest. I was arrested later in - when I was already in another camp called Bhengu.

The road was leading to Quattro.  When I was about to ask people that this road doesn't lead to - I mean, this road doesn't lead to Quashito, where are we going, they ordered me out of the Land Rover and they encircled me and with their AKs aimed at me, and they ordered me to lie down on the road.  I thought they were going to kill me, but they didn't kill me. I only tied me on my back and kicked me inside the Land Rover and piled a lot of newspapers on top of me, so that if we pass any control posts those local people wouldn't see that there SOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n13 L DYASOP\nis somebody who was arrested.\n So I got to Quattro, I didn't even know I was in Quattro.  But when I was in Quattro, one of these Land Rovers stopped.  They all got out and then I heard a voice that was Dan Mashego.  Dan Mashego who was a chief of staff in Quattro, ordered me to get out.

So he punched me and punched me back, I lost my tooth, even before I could even get into that reception of Quattro.
