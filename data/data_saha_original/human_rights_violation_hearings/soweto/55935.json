On that particular day I was not at home, I was in Transkei.  It was only children at home.  His brother was there. He is the one who was told by the people that he was shot on the\nSOWETO HEARING GAUTENG PROVINCE\n2 I NDIBONGO\nbridge.  He drove, he went there because by that time is was already announced that in Baragwanath Hospital it is already full.  The people should be taken to Krugersdorp.  It was already in the evening.  They did not even the know the way to Krugersdorp because people were getting lost there and soldiers were on their way, always stopping them until they reached the place.  \n When he was about to be examined by the doctor, while they were still waiting, he was delaying from the other side.  There were other people always coming out.  They decided to go and check what is happening because he is not coming out.  It is when they were told that when they brought him in he was already dead.",

So, it is doubly tragic in that sense that unknown gunmen and the problem of actually getting him to a hospital where if he could have been attended to in time, it was possible that maybe something could have been done to save him.\n I suppose from the Commission, what is important is \nSOWETO HEARING GAUTENG PROVINCE\n4 I NDIBONGO\nthat, hopefully, by Michael being acknowledged in this way, as one of those victims of that terrible event in 1976, maybe this will help in some way.  The investigations will certainly continue and we hope that the more people who come forward, the more we will find out about what happened, but I know that it may not be much of assistance to you because for you I am sure the important thing is to try and understand and know what happened on that particular day.",

Maybe you know that there is another Committee that we have.  The one that deals with the Human Rights Violations.  We have another one which is called the Amnesty Committee.  The one that is Amnesty Committee we are calling people who did some terrible things in the past to come and talk publicly about the things that they have done.  We hopefully think that people like you will hear the people confessing saying that on a particular day I killed people innocently.  We also hope that you are going to get peace if you know what happened.  Thank you very much.\nSOWETO HEARING GAUTENG PROVINCE",
