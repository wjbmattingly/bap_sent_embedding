I went to primary school at the St Mary's Anglican School in Orlando East and I went to high school at the Stofberg Gedenk Skool where I actually obtained my education in the medium of Afrikaans.  That was by choice.  My parents did not force me to go Stofberg Gedenk Skool.  I had a reason why I wanted to go to Stofberg Gedenk Skool.  After matriculating I worked as a switchboard operator for a newspaper called Eleto Mirror and thereafter I was offered a job at the World Newspaper.  I became a self-styled journalist.  I became in journalist in 1965 and I continued until 1992.  I am from a family of five children, two sisters and three brothers.  After I gave up my job as a journalist, I became a cognitive and life skill facilitator teaching thinking skills and life skills in prisons to prisoners.

            "Yes.  On the 15th of June 1976 I was working for Weekend World.  At about four thirty I was preparing to go home because it was not a very busy day for me.  Ten minutes SOWETO HEARING GAUTENG PROVINCE\n3 S THEMA\nbefore I left my office a young girl came into our office dressed in a black and white uniform.  She had an envelope in her hand and after entering our office she enquired from my colleagues who Sophie Thema was.  I heard her mention my name and I stepped forward and I told her that I was Sophie Thema.  She handed me the letter.  She did not wait for me to open the letter and read the letter.  She turned back and ran out of the office.  I remained reading the letter. It was a short note informing me that the following day there was going to be a march by students from the Naledi High School.  The letter mentioned that they were going to end up at the Orlando Stadium.  I took this letter to my news Editor who was a Mr John Miscally and we immediately make arrangements that a car pick me up from home the following morning on June 16 and six thirty.  A photographer was also dispatched together with a driver.  \n The following morning at half past six I, the photographer, Dan Kletekle, the driver who is now deceased, Stanley Mojale, left our homes and proceeded.  We were hoping to get to Naledi High, but we did not because we met the students at Sizwe Stores as they were coming from Naledi towards Lebonie.  Lebonie is just opposite the Sizwe Stores and that is where we met them.  The students were in a jubilant mood.  They did not give the impression that they were going to be violent or that they were violent in so much that at one stage I and Dan actually marched with them.  Dan particularly for the reason that he could get, you know, the best pictures and I was just marching with them for the fun of it.  We finally got to Orlando West.\n When we got to Orlando West I immediately saw a contingent of police coming up from the eastern side of \nSOWETO HEARING GAUTENG PROVINCE\n4 S THEMA\nOrlando West.  They turned into a street which actually caused them to come face to face with the students.  The students were now facing east and the police were facing west.  I then positioned myself in such a way that visibility was clear, that I could see everything that was taking place, I and Stanley Mojale.  At that time Dan Kletekle was moving around somewhere so that he could also get the best of pictures.  At no time did I hear a warning being sounded to the students to disperse and the students were standing there like children who do, I mean, children do taunt.  They taunt one another and they were there taunting the police.  Some of them picked up little, what I would call, little pebbles, stones, little stones and threw them towards the police.  That is what actually angered the police.  To me it was like a movie unfolding before me.  I did not really think that they were going to shoot at those young children, but they did.  In so much that I stood there and I do not think they heard me, but I was screaming, do not shoot our children, but they were shooting.  \n As I and Stanley were standing there helpless, not knowing what to do, a young man came running up to us.  He was shot in the leg.  I asked Stanley to take this little guy and rush him to the nearest clinic in Orlando West.  Then Stanley said to me I cannot go alone, go with me.  I got into the car with Stanley and we rushed to the clinic, dropped this guy there and drove back to Orlando West.  As we were driving back to Orlando West, that is when we noticed this young girl with agony and anguish on her face come running up the street.  Next to her was this young man in an overall and carrying a young boy in his arms.  I was with Stanley in the car, we were driving down the street.  \nSOWETO HEARING GAUTENG PROVINCE\n5 S THEMA\nWhen I saw that I said to him, Stanley, stop and he immediately stopped the car.  I said to them, come into the car, Stanley please take these people to hospital or to the clinic, wherever you can.  Stanley managed to get the three of them that was, I later came to know that it was Antoinette, Hector's sister, it was the Makoeba boy and it was Hector.  I realised that as they were going into the Volkswagen Hector was already gasping, but there was nothing I could say, I was just hoping and praying for the best.  Stanley and the three of them drove to the clinic.  At that time there was shooting all over and it did not dawn on me at that time that a stray bullet could hit me or anything.  I just wanted to get to the clinic myself.  I ran up to the clinic on foot.  \n When I got to the clinic there was confusion in the clinic.  Everybody was just asking what is going on, how did it happen and nobody could explain to them at that time.  We just, all we said was the police shot him.  I realised that he had a wound in his throat and to me it indicated that it is where the bullet had gone in.  A doctor came forward and he said to me, Mama, is this your child?  I said to him, yes doctor, he is my child though I am not his biological mother.  He is my child in that I saw him, he got injured and I brought him to the clinic.  He said to me, I am sorry, it is too late.  He has been shot in the throat, the doctor said and, you know, Antoinette was besides herself and everybody was just besides themselves and later in the afternoon we took Antoinette to her home together with some members of the staff and other people who had gathered at the clinic.  It was only when I got to Antoinette's home that I realised that I had known that family even before \nSOWETO HEARING GAUTENG PROVINCE\n6 S THEMA\nthat day, but I did not know that Hector was their child, but I was pleased that at least I had rendered a good service because on that day I felt that I put away my journalistic ethics and my motherly instinct to control.",

            "My opinion is that Afrikaans was just the last straw that broke the camel's back.  I can site one incident, you know, that during my career as a journalist really hurt me and this was when a woman's husband died.  That woman had reached the end of the road of her livelihood because she was not entitled to own a house.  If a man married a woman outside Johannesburg and she did not have the right qualifications that was either Section 10(1)A, B or C, that man was not allowed to stay with his wife.  That woman would be given 72 hours to leave the area.  Children who had lost their parents, often children were not allowed to have homes.  Our parents were sometimes woken at about four o' clock in the morning by what we use to call Gokasambe, those were called the black jacks, the henchmen of the township\nSOWETO HEARING GAUTENG PROVINCE\n8 S THEMA\nsuperintendents because they were in arrears with their rents.  Those township superintendents were a law unto themselves because they would wait for the very, very cold months like June and July and then they would start evicting people, throwing them onto the streets, locking them out of their houses.  \n If I might just mention, more often than not, I would find some of these people who had been evicted from their homes because they were in arrears with their rents and I would appeal to the Institute of Race Relations, at that time, where Mrs Ina Pearlman was employed.  I must Ina Pearlman did a lot to get many of those people back into their homes by paying their rent arrears and that gave rise to the formation of Operation Hunger because Ina had a problem.  She said to me, Sophie, it is all well and good me getting these people back into their homes, but what do they live on, what do they eat?  They hunger and starve and that is how she got the idea of starting Operation Hunger.",

I remember, I with the now editor of the Sowetan, Andre Klaaste, we were colleagues at that time and working for Weekend World.  Before June 1976 we knew, we had a suspicion, we had that gut feeling that if\nSOWETO HEARING GAUTENG PROVINCE\n9 S THEMA\nTreurnicht was going to go on with his proposal of introducing Afrikaans as a medium of instruction, there was going to be problems in this country.  We then went around at night and tried to get hold of people of integrity, people who we thought, you know, were being recognised by the community as leaders.  We tried to say to them cannot you people get a delegation or send some kind of message to this man to tell him that once he introduces Afrikaans as a medium of instruction in our schools, there is going to be chaos, but many of our leaders, I would not say were not prepared, I think they were scared and I do not blame them because at that time anybody who stood up to oppose any policy from the Government was silenced brutally.",

Most surprisingly was that most of those mothers who were involved did not have children in jail, they had none of their children killed, but those were the mothers who actually stood up and we were not surprised because we knew that those mothers who had children in jail, who had children killed they had been so traumatised that they did not want to get themselves involved any further.  So the parents, the woman who actually stood up were those who were not effected in any way, but who felt the pain and who felt that we need to support those mothers who lost their children, whose children had been imprisoned.\n We use to meet at night, different venues.  We made sure that the police never found out where we met and we \nSOWETO HEARING GAUTENG PROVINCE\n10 S THEMA\nsometimes got some of the mothers to smuggle into prison food for the children because they were not allowed to get food from their families.

In this letter they actually told me that Tietsie had skipped the country and he was in Botswana.  We all got very excited, I wrote the story and on Sunday the story was on the front page of Weekend World that Tietsie had skipped the country.

Their intention was just to express a feeling that was within them that we do not want Afrikaans as a medium of instruction.

They took a great risk, even in 1976, to have exposed what happened during that period and not journalists only, but even other people in the community.  Leaders, you know, people who were recognised as leaders of the\nSOWETO HEARING GAUTENG PROVINCE\n15 S THEMA\ncommunity.  People in the community tried to help.  Some of those people were actually silenced and I think that the Government should really take a stand that people should be allowed to express their opinions, they should be allowed to express their feelings.  I mean if we are talking about democracy I think that is what it is all about.  We are experiencing something called democracy for the first time in our country.  It is something that we are not use to, but I think with this new Government our appeal would be make it as safe as possible for the journalists that they do not suffer the same consequences as some of our journalists suffered in the past and are still suffering today.",
