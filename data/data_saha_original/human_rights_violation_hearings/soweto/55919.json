We will certainly take this into consideration when we write up a report and\nSOWETO HEARING GAUTENG PROVINCE\n5 Y MAKGOLO\npeople's requests.  We thank you very much for coming forward.\n I just want to thank all of you who have persevered till this late hour, half past six.  We thank you very much.  To us it is an indication that many people are aware that the reason why we are bringing these hearings closer to the communities is to challenge people to realise that the survivors and the victims will not heal on their own.  They need a lot of support.  So by staying, listening to them in such a cold hall till the end is an communication to them.  You are communicating your availability, you are communicating your presence.  When we started here on Sunday the Priest who was here, I should think it is Reverend Mabuso, he said the Church should open its doors for facilitating the healing and I would like to go beyond that and say that may the community of Soweto, all the structures, women's organisations, the civics, may they really open their doors too and realise that what the Commission is doing is a beginning of a much more complex task that is the healing of those who were deeply hurt and injured by the past practices.\n I also want to just thank our witnesses because what they have said so far, it clearly indicates to us that this trying to recollect what happened in 1976 is much more complex than we all envisaged in the sense that they have all be struggling with a traumatic memory and in the process of doing that, each testimony is like a piece within a bigger puzzle.  It fits in, it closes the wounds in some instances, it closes the gaps in other peoples minds.  We could see how even the witnesses tried to support each other and said, where X could not remember, this is exactly what \nSOWETO HEARING GAUTENG PROVINCE\n6 Y MAKGOLO\nhappened.  I should think what the Commission has done is the beginning of ongoing work which, in this area, should continue, people assisting each other to make sense of what happened on that day.  \n We will continue tomorrow.  We will be here till Friday and we are challenging the people of Soweto to come forward, make the statements inbetween, but also to support the witnesses.  When they leave this hall they should go back to a receptive community which is prepared to hear their agonies.  Tomorrow we will start at nine o' clock and hopefully we will end much earlier.  We have fewer witnesses tomorrow.  Thank you very much.  \nSOWETO HEARING GAUTENG PROVINCE",
