            "It was on the 16th of July 1987, it was a week before Dick's wedding.  He had to take the wife home, to make the last preparations before the wedding.  Unfortunately Dick did not return alive. We were made aware that Dick met an accident. We do not believe it was an accident, because there are conflicting statements.  Dick's friend does not say anything about the accident. It is a policeman who tell us about the incident.  So we were told on the Wednesday, at 12 midnight when he was at his fiancee's home in Ladysmith and then the following morning Dick was supposed to go to Welkom for a - to go and investigat a case, which up to this day we are not sure what the case was about.\n He served articles under Priscilla Jana and on two \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 M MHLONGO\noccasions he flew to PE to go and make some investigations.  We are not sure what the cases were about.\n So that morning Dick did not come back home.  We phoned Ladysmith, that was Dick's fiancee, to find out where Dick is because he was supposed to go to Welkom.  \n We also phoned Priscille Jana, to find out if it is possible that Dick left for Welkom without coming home.  So Priscilla also, she was also surprised.\n My sister phoned, I think the whole morning she did not work, she kept on phoning Ladysmith, that was Dick's fiancee.  She asked her to find out what is happening.  So she said she phoned the Red Cross, she phoned the hospitals, to find out if there was an accident and Red Cross there was no accident, they know of no accident. \n Later we forced her to go to the police station, to go out and look for Dick.  So at about six pm on Thursday, she phoned to say Dick is dead, Dick is at the police station in Ladysmith.  The following morning at seven o'clock we left for Ladysmith to go and find out if it is really true that Dick is dead.  We found him in the police station, at the mortuary.  We were with Dick's friends and they went in and they asked us not to go in and see Dick.  They wanted us to picture him the way he looked before.  So we did not go in.\n We asked about the friends and they said the friend is at the hospital.  We left for the hospital.  We found him. He only had a scratch on the forehead, a minor scratch, but he pretended as if he was, he could not recognise us.  So we came back home.\n In fact, before coming back home, we had to find out when should we collect Dick's corpse.  Then we spoke to Sgt Bekker.  Sgt Bekker is the man who was in charge of Dick's \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 M MHLONGO\ncorpse.  He said before we leave we must phone to find out if he is there.  When we phoned on Saturday morning, ready to go and collect Dick's corpse, Sgt Bekker was on duty, we must phone on Monday morning to collect the corpse.  Monday morning we phoned.  My uncle went and collected the corpse.  When they arrived there, Dick's head was gashed, as if he was hit with a sharp weapon on the head.  But the policeman said to us that the accident was caused by a truck which knocked or it collided with a cow, and then that cow was wandering on the main road.  Then the truck did not stop.",

Because when we went there the second time to find out what actually happened, Van der Berg was transferred to a certain station, and the case was handled by Sgt Pretorius.  He said to us apparently, I am quoting him, Dick's car was the tenth and unfortunately for Dick he fell out of the car and he died.  So when we questioned where were the other ten, he told us that the ten were standing on the side.  They actually saw him come and Dick was driving at a high speed and they could not stop him.\n But when we spoke to Wisile Mafalan, I am sorry to mention names, the friend, the friend with whom he was, and he was supposed to be Dick's best man. He said to us when they left Dick's fiancee's home, there were people outside in cars and there is only one entrance from Ladysmith. So somewhere where they took a turn, they actually recognised a car coming from behind.  Dick tried to drive fast. \nSOWETO HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 M MHLONGO\nUnfortunately just before him there was a car which stopped.  Then what happened when we asked Mfalane he says I slept. He doesn't tell us what happened.  So he tells us nothing about the car.\n We tried to ask lawyers to talk to him, friends to talk to him. All he says to us when we left Ladysmith there were cars and that one car followed us, one car stopped from the front and then what happened, I slept.\n So nobody was able to force him to talk. Up to this day he is still quiet, he is silent.  Dick's fiancee up to this day, she is silent.  So we don't know what happened to him.  But he is dead.",
