He arrived late in the afternoon, around seven o'clock, then there was an unrest in our area, then he entered the house, then we stayed with him in the house.  Then from there we went to sleep.  My son went to his bedroom to sleep.  Then after that, I heard footsteps in my house, then they were fast, then they knocked and they were pushing the doors.  Then somebody said, open!  So I said, who are you because I'm an old woman?  Then they said, open up.  I woke up.  After that they've already opened the bedroom where my son was  sleeping.  They didn't give him time.  They took him with the guns, then they said to me, go and sleep, you old woman.  Then when I asked, where are you taking him to?  They dragged him outside and the police cars were surrounding the house and the police were in the house and, together with the soldiers.  They put him in a Hippo and other, his siblings were also  in that police van.\n To-morrow morning when  I wanted to find out what happened to them, they were taken to Motswedi police station.  I went to Motswedi police station.  They were at Welgedacht.  They were locked in a cell.  I went back home.  I slept.  Then when they were taken to court, when they were released at home he had his leg bandaged because he was tortured.  He didn't say anything, he took his bag and said, I'm going, I'm running away, because they're going to arrest me again.  My son then left.  \n Then  the unrest went on.  My son just disappeared.  We didn't see him again, since he left that day, even up to now we haven't seen him.  I haven't seen him since that day.  Whether he has died, or what happened to him, I don't know.\nPROF. MEIRING: Thank you, Mrs Rantao.  We've listened to your story.  Thank you that you told  it to us.  May we talk a little bit about the disappearance of your son.  I just want to know, why did the police pick on him?  Was he a political activist?  Was he known amongst his friend that he was very active politically ?",

We can, we can take that information from you.  Our statement takers are at the back of the hall and it will greatly assist our enquiries and certainly it will help Mrs Rantao in her suffering.
