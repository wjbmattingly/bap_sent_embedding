Somebody came and wake us up, saying people are crowded at the shop and they were singing ANC slogans and they are looting at the restaurant and the restaurant is burning.  That's why father walk up to that place.  When he arrived there he saw many people, therefore you couldn't do anything.  He turned back and went to the police next to the Botswana border.  He came with the police.\n When they arrived there the shop was gutted.  Then they went home whilst those people are still there.  They came home.  They found the police there and then the police shot them and they ran away, then the police were coming in many instances and protecting.  They would come for thirty minutes and leave.  After  four days, it was during the day and my parents were sitting under the tree, I was sleeping at that time, I could hear a sound but I thought I was dreaming, then I slept again.  Then I could hear stone throwing.  My parents ran away and went into the house and outside were full of people holding ANC flags and placards and throwing stones inside the house and the house was burning.  We were sitting inside the house not knowing what to do.  The house was burning, the floor was burning, the ceiling was burning and the ceiling was falling on the ground.  We would run to the rooms where there is no fire and later the whole house was gutted to the ground.  Not knowing what to do, we ran outside the house and they were throwing, still throwing stones.  A certain boy came to  help  me.  A  certain  one  came with a spear then he tried to stab me but the boy who helped me, protected me.  I was hit with stones and some of my teeth were removed, my two siblings were able to run away.  \n In the house was my father and my uncle and inside they were burnt by that fire, then they ran out, then my father wanted to jump the fence.  A certain boy came with a spade and slapped him and then he fell on the ground.  He was pulled outside but my uncle was able to run for a distance.  After that he was caught and there was a container of diesel, they were put just next to that container and they were slapped with those spades.  They took tyres which were outside and put them on their neck and they were burnt.  \n After that the police came after three hours they were taken and all of us, together with my, with my brother, we were taken to the hospital.  They took my father and my uncle to the mortuary.  The police came after two weeks to take the statement.  From there we submitted our statement, then we went to court but we were not  informed to come to court, but I went to the police station to ask them, why did they take statements and they don't want us to come to court, but the police said they were afraid of the confusion because those people would come, so they were waiting for come.  The court case proceeded.  Those people who were arrested, were given bail, because we gave them names of people who were leaders.  Even up to-day, we didn't go, the court case didn't proceed.  Even when, even to-day, they still say, they are still investigating about those people.",

Did  people  treat  you  psychologically for what happened ?",
