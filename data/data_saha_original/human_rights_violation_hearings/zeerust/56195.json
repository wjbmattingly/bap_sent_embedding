People in small villages, in big towns became divided.  On the one side because many of our people were not allowed to express what they wanted and what they demanded in terms of their political expressions and on the other side, some people who supported a particular movement at times became targets as well, and your daughter, like so many other children in our country became victims.  A young person of eighteen who to-day would have been contributing greatly to the development of this particular region of our country, lost her life and you lost a daughter and your family, your  daughters  and  sons  lost a  sister.  We're  very  sorry  to hear about that.\n We thank you for coming here to-day and we will come back to you.  I'm going  to ask for a tea break at this stage, but before I do that I just want to welcome some people to our hearing to-day.  The Premier of the North West Region, Mr Popo Molefe, welcome Sir, Mr Mike Ntolo who is the MEC for Public, no sorry, he's not he's just part of your constituency, sorry, Mr George Batsedulang and Councilor Majoro.  We also have Mayoress, Mrs Sophie Leber, Lebercoro, sorry, Ugone.  Welcome to all of you.  I'm also going to take the opportunity of asking the Premier who has come to almost all the hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to come forward and say a few words.  We would like to give you the opportunity Sir, to do, to say to people here to-day.\n(clapping of hands)",
