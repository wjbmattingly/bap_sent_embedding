<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">SISINYANE RANTAO:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Professor Meiring.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> Mrs Rantao, can you hear me ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> I hear you well, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> Thank you for coming.  You want to tell us about your son, Elliot Mokoena.  Eight years ago, when he was twenty eight years old, something happened in your family.  Something happened to him.  Please tell us about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> In 1989, my son arrived at home, then that time there was confusion, or there was political conflict at that time.  He was working at a mine in Rustenberg.  He arrived late in the afternoon, around seven o'clock, then there was an unrest in our area, then he entered the house, then we stayed with him in the house.  Then from there we went to sleep.  My son went to his bedroom to sleep.  Then after that, I heard footsteps in my house, then they were fast, then they knocked and they were pushing the doors.  Then somebody said, open!  So I said, who are you because I'm an old woman?  Then they said, open up.  I woke up.  After that they've already opened the bedroom where my son was  sleeping.  They didn't give him time.  They took him with the guns, then they said to me, go and sleep, you old woman.  Then when I asked, where are you taking him to?  They dragged him outside and the police cars were surrounding the house and the police were in the house and, together with the soldiers.  They put him in a Hippo and other, his siblings were also  in that police van.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a> To-morrow morning when  I wanted to find out what happened to them, they were taken to Motswedi police station.  I went to Motswedi police station.  They were at Welgedacht.  They were locked in a cell.  I went back home.  I slept.  Then when they were taken to court, when they were released at home he had his leg bandaged because he was tortured.  He didn't say anything, he took his bag and said, I'm going, I'm running away, because they're going to arrest me again.  My son then left.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a> Then  the unrest went on.  My son just disappeared.  We didn't see him again, since he left that day, even up to now we haven't seen him.  I haven't seen him since that day.  Whether he has died, or what happened to him, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> Thank you, Mrs Rantao.  We've listened to your story.  Thank you that you told  it to us.  May we talk a little bit about the disappearance of your son.  I just want to know, why did the police pick on him?  Was he a political activist?  Was he known amongst his friend that he was very active politically ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> He was a visitor arriving from work.  He didn't know that there is an unrest.  I don't even understand about this political activity but I don't believe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> So, it was just a horrible mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> I believe it was a mistake for the police to come and fetch him, because he was just arriving.  He didn't even went around  in our area, in the village.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> He was twenty years old.  Did he work at that stage ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> Yes, he was working in Rustenberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> Rustenberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> He was working at Swartklip mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> Was he already married ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> He was still young.  He wasn't married yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> Were there any children, were there any children that he had to look after ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> He didn't have a child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> So, he  had to take care of his mother ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> Yes, he was looking after me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> So he was sent then to prison and he was released and there, they, his left ... (interrupted)</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> Yes, he was released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> And on that day he came home with his leg bandaged and he said he had enough.  He wanted to leave.  Did you have, do you have any ... (interrupted)</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> Then said he's running away, because  they may re-arrest him again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> And you have no idea where he went?  And that was not the only bad thing that happened to you.  Your mother, Pauline, that her house was also burnt.  Was that related to this incident or was that completely another ... (interrupted)</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> After that, the house was burnt.  We fled, we were no more at that place.  I think in 1991.  They took my property inside the house but I cannot tell who took them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> So that was two years later.  Your son's disappearance was in 1989 and the burning down of your mother's house was in 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> My child disappeared in 1989 and my house was burnt, my mother's house was burnt in 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> Are you working at the moment ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> I try to look for him, even in Johannesburg, I went even in the hospitals in Krugersdorp and other areas.   I went to the police in Johannesburg but I couldn't, I couldn't find any trace.  Then I went back home and just gave up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> At the moment are you working, are you employed ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> I'm not working, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> How many children do you have to look after ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> I have  three children and the other one is a cripple.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">PROF. MEIRING:</span> Mrs Rantao, thank you.  I've made notes and those are the questions I needed to ask.  I hand over to the Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MISS SEROKE:</span> Didn't you hear anything of maybe what happened in the mines that when he arrived at home they came and picked him up ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> I don't understand, because I didn't hear any kind of a rumour of that kind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MISS SEROKE:</span> At home when, at the time when he was picked up, what was happening in the village ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> It was during the time of the unrests.  It was during April, in Good Friday and  he came as a person who's come for a holiday.  He was taken on the 24th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MISS SEROKE:</span> What was .... (interrupted)</p>

<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MISS SEROKE:</span> He arrived at a time when  you were taken by the police or maybe was it quiet at that time ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> He arrived at seven o'clock in the evening but during that time, the, this fight was going on.  Then we slept and then the police came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MISS SEROKE:</span> Were the police going house to house or they came to your house ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> It's not only my house but it's - they weren't in the whole village.  He was not the only child who was arrested but many, many people were shot and many people were arrested.  Boys and girls, it was just the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MISS SEROKE:</span> In  your statements, you say you are staying in a shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MRS RANTAO:</span> Yes, that's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MISS SEROKE:</span> Is that the same village ......</p>

<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MISS SEROKE:</span> Thank you, Ma'am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mrs Rantao, thank you very, very much for coming.  We see and we hear your suffering.  To have lost a son at such a young age and still not knowing where he is, must be frightening.  I want to appeal actually to-day that to many of the people who was sitting here, because we've heard many stories from Legobo to-day, that if there's anybody here to-day who can give us any information about this young man, I think that the opportunity is here.  We can, we can take that information from you.  Our statement takers are at the back of the hall and it will greatly assist our enquiries and certainly it will help Mrs Rantao in her suffering.  So please, if there's anybody who knows as to what happened to this young man, if you can come forward.  I thank you very much Mrs Rantao for coming to-day.</p>
