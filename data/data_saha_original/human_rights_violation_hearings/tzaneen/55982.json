            "What happened on the twenty eighth of March in 1986 at Lulekane.  It was on a Good Friday.  Before that date there was a problem within the Lulekane Township.  There were these soldiers who were coming from outside country.  They were staying in another secret camp just next to our township.  Those people, before they came to our township.  It was very quiet but after their arrival peace was no longer there.  These people used to drink a lot and when they are drunk, they were drunk they used to go around the streets and started harassing people.  If they find you during the evening, they used to assault you, to beat people up without knowing the reason.  They used to assault us very badly.  The community of Lulekane, more especially the youth, we gathered together and tried to discuss this problem.  To assist each other in order to control the area, because it was no longer safe.  We gathered and discussed about these matters, we assisted each other with ideas, how we could remove these people from our township.  They should no longer set their foot in our township, because it was no longer safe if they were, they were around the township.  We agreed on those points.  There is nothing that we did to drive those people out of our township, because we tried to confront them at the beginning.  It was just a few of us who used to go there.  Sometimes other people, youth, used not to come.\n So, during that day that I've already mentioned, in the evening, we were sitting in a shabeen enjoying ourselves there and then immediately a bomb exploded in that particular place.  It was during the night.   No one expected that a bomb would explode.  Even myself, I was in that particular place.  I never heard a bomb exploding even a single day, except that day.  I used just to see it on films.  I was very scared.  People dispersed in that area.  I didn't run away myself.  I was inside and then I went out and I was on the  street.  After I heard that there were people who were inside, who were left there and my younger brother was also there and then I went back  to check what happened actually.  I found that the whole place was damaged.  Not even a single person  whom I was together with answered me.  Some of them were screaming, there was a fence, behind the fence.  Some of them called m, called me to assist them, to give them help and I didn't know what to do by that time.  I was shocked.  I looked around on the bodies.  I could not see my brother.  We left together with, with some two youths.  I went to report this matter at home.  When we arrived at home we found that my, my brother was not there too and we started looking around for him.  We went to the hospital that time, and to the police station.  They said we cannot enter in the mortuary to check, in the government mortuary, because we're still very young.  They refused us permission to enter until we got the help of Reverend Kwiniga, then we found him in the government mortuary.  You could not even recognize him.  That's what happened on that particular day.",
