Your husband didn't die in vain, my sister, we also thank you for coming over here so that we can tell the whole country, so that all the generations can be able to say, \"we will never again do something like this, never again will these things happen again to us\", at the time now we will be able to say, to recognise the dignity of a human being.

He used to be committed very much in the struggle, he was a member of the ANC at the time. A man, a Mr Zokqua, was a friend of his at the time. Lots of things happened in Butterworth at the time, we used to be detained lots of times because we used to stay together. At another time he was detained for two weeks, I was also detained with him and then I was released on the second week.

            "On the 7th of February 1988, he woke up very early but he had a problem with his car, that's why now he left his car and he used the Honda Ballade which was brown. He was going to Umtata because he was a rep of the SAB. On his way to Umtata he gave Thozamile Nkume a lift, he was also resided in Umtata. They both went to Umtata. When they got to Umtata there was another man who he was detained with, a Mr Mayaphi, now this man, they were going to see this man in jail Mr Mayaphi, there was another housed that they used to stay in at Mbokwe, the policemen came to this house and they just sprayed the whole house with bullets, thinking that my husband and his friends were in the house. Now around lunch time, around 1.00pm my husband called me just before lunch, called me, telling me that he was coming back to Butterworth, so during lunch time they decided to have a braai at Ncambedlana, at Mbuqe. Now on their way to the braai, they saw a white 4 x 4 and another white Kombi also with tinted windows, Number Plates - XF. There were four in the car, it was himself, Zona Wetle, Thozamile Nkume, Zonwabele Mayaphi and another one, and also Zolila Sangoni and there was another man called Gift, I can't remember his another name, he is the one who used to say \"do you guys see that we are being followed\", when they got to Mnado they braai'ed, they continued with the braai and then from there, from the braai spot, this Kombi and this 4 x 4 was also following them, still watching them. The Kombi started to flicker at them, then Zolile started saying \"you guys, do you know who knows anything about this Kombi, because now it was starting to flicker at them. One of them answered \"No, we don't know anyone in that Kombi. Again the Kombi started to flicker and then later they started to stop. The Kombi's also stopped, Zolile was still in the car, the sliding door of the Kombi now was started to open, there was a flood of bullets, it was non-stop. It seemed like the reason why they shooting like this, they didn't want anybody to survive in the car. The bullet shells that were found there were more than 30. Most of these bullets were aimed at him, this is now, why now he couldn't survive he died on that spot and this other man Mr Mayaphi who was in pain, now this people from this 4 x 4 and the Kombi ran away, left him there, one of them was Mbulelo Wana and the other one was Madliwa and Captain Le Roux. There were other three girls who were in this Kombi that they didn't show. One of those girls was Ntlola Shosha. The Transkeian police arrived on the scene but they didn't want anybody to be taken out of the car, now while the man was still in excruciating pain, they were still asking them questions, they were asking to be taken to hospitals, but the police didn't care at all. At a later stage they were taken to hospital, but only one survived, the other three were already dead. The pathologist who was taking care of the bodies described that the bullets as strong as to pierce an iron rod, it was my first time to see a person who has been shot such that a bone was hanging outside, that's how my husband Zolile was, he was shot in the thigh, the way he was swollen he looked like a pig, it was because of all the bullets that were sprayed all over his body.",

I noticed that when you began to make your testimony your face, your eye, clearly conveyed that you loved your husband very dearly and I am sure that your husband also loved you, but your husband had another love and that was the love for this country and the love for justice and for that love he paid the ultimate price.\n We salute you, we salute your husband, we salute the families -your family and your husband's family that supported you - but if I may on behalf of the Commission, I want to make a call, I want to make a call to those in authority who are still alive, who know what happened, to come forward and tell the Commission what they know.  I think one of the most painful things that keeps on coming up is that the people who are responsible for these things, live in our communities but they are not coming forward and there is going to be no healing, there is going to be no reconciliation until those people voluntarily come up and tell us what happened so that we can then propose a way in which reconciliation and forgiveness can take place. Policemen, especially policemen like us, Black as us, we ask them to please come forward, they mustn't wait until they are being called, they mustn't wait until their names are being called in these hearings, they must come forward voluntarily, they must come and they must tell the country what happened, not only about what is happening here, about was happening in the whole country so that we can attempt to forgive ...(inaudible)  mentioned then that is opportunity, but when they come before they have even been mentioned then indeed they will be showing that they are committed to reconciliation and to the truth. \n Thank you very much for what you have done and all the sacrifice that you have given, for all what you have given us we would like to tell you and we will give you assurance that we will try to meet and fulfil your wishes and needs and respect of the courage that you have shown as his wife.",
