He said one of the truths that we are supposed to investigate is that the institutions, the tertiary institutions, what is the role that they played. As we are going to start with Dugard's story, we think of the ways that the South African Government is also implicated in these investigations and these testimonies. I also want to add that one of the things we want to investigate about, is that how far through and where does it start and it ends, the involvement of the tertiary institutions.  We all know the history of this country, especially in this one, in the Transkei.  We were given the so-called independence because we suspected this whole thing of this independence, and Mr Matanzima was replaced by George Mantanzima, he was also replaced by Stella Sigcau. She was also replaced by Bantu Holomisa.\n. We have heard now today that that one is also supposed to be replaced.  Now this is also going to give us clarity on which period exactly did this government - we also want to find out now the period, who all these people were, the people who were trying to take over this government, especially who are these people that were trying to involve the South African Government.  \n I welcome both of you.  I also want to talk about, tell you that Dugard is going to talk about his brother Attwell Mazizi Maqekeza who died in Lesotho, who was shot by unknown people.  \n Dugard here is here to talk about violation of human rights.  I would like Dugard to please tell us why are you \nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 D Z MAQEKEZA\nhere today.",

            "I was arrested by the Transkeian security police in March 1988, at the beginning of March.  I was at work at that time.  I was working as a secretary at the Works and Energy. That was the first time they arrested me.  They used to arrest me several times, just before, ask me a couple of questions and then they would release me again.  But on this particular day they took me to Norwood prison.  There is another house that they used to use, it looks like it was their branch, where they used to work.\n When we got there, they put me in a small room.  Not long after I had been there, about five policemen arrived.  I would like to say that they were led by Sgt Shota.  Sgt Shota was the leader of the security police at the time.\n They said where is your brother, your older brother. I said I did not know.  I said no, I don't know anything about him.  They said oh, you are still lying, you are going to tell the truth. \n So that time they said to me get your clothes off.  So I only took off my jacket and I put it aside.  They said take off your clothes.  So I hesitantly took off my shirt.  They slapped me in my face.  They punched me as well.  They kicked me. I was wondering what is going on now.  Now this went on for a long time. In fact, they took all my clothes, all except my underpants.  These assaults went on.  They would beat me up and they would ask me questions and beat me up.  Eventually I told them really that I don't know anything about him, which was true.\n Now this happened in the morning, around ten. Now around two in the afternoon, they started to change things.  They took the table, they put it in the middle of the room.  UMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n4 D Z MAQEKEZA\nThen I was made to lie on my stomach on the table. Two held me on both sides of my hands and some held down my waist.  Then my head was a little bit hanging over the table.  They had this canvass bag which had water in it.  When I looked at it, it wasn't full, it was only half full.  They took my head right into this bag and then they tied the bag.  At the time I was trying to struggle to get out.  I don't know how many minutes that was and then they took this bag off my head.\n Firstly you must realise that I couldn't even breathe, I couldn't speak.  It was very confusing in there. They would ask me - during this whole time they are beating you up.  Then after 10 minutes, according to them, if you are not telling them the truth that they want, they will take you back again to that half/full bag of water.  They said we want these people on television, you are going to tell us where they are.  This went on, I think three times, putting me in this canvass bag.  Eventually they released me.\n They took me and locked me up in the central prison here in Umtata, where I stayed for 90 days.  That is now three months.  After that three months I was released. They didn't do anything to me after that.",

He said he was calling from Lesotho.  He said to me your elder brother has been shot, as we speak, he is in  hospital.  I said what happened, why was he shot.  So he said they were walking, it was himself, William Ngomo, Tandefeki Radebi, son of Dr Malega who was a student at the time.\n They were from Roma to Mafekeng.  Before they went to Mafekeng, soldiers' vehicles approached them and they stopped them on the road. They said to them they must lean against the car. So they did.  Then they searched them. Confiscated whatever they had with them.  After that they asked identify yourselves.  So they did.  They said we are only students here at Roma. So they said show us your student identity cards. So the other two apparently they didn't have their student cards.  So now my brother started \nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n7 D Z MAQEKEZA\nto negotiate that no, we are students.  He tried to say no, we are students, but we don't have our student cards here with us, because we didn't think that we will meet you and you will be asking for our student cards.  So they said we have orders to shoot you. The others said why, why are you going to kill us.  They said because you are member of the ANC, you must not deny this, we know this.  After that they started to shoot.\n Now the story goes on like this.  My brother and Willie Ngoma, they escaped from this truck and they left. When my brother was trying to escape, they shot him on his knees, both of them. Then Radebe was left on the spot.  William Ngoma escaped to the university, where he met some of the ANC members.  Then he told them the story about what had happened.  He told them he met these men who said they have orders to shoot us.  And Philo - that is how my brother used to be called - has been shot, but we don't know where he is.  Later, after some investigations, it was found that when after he was shot, he slept there, he spent the whole night there on the spot. Now in the morning some of the people from the village picked him up.  They could see that he was injured, but the was unconcious.  They took him to the hospital.  When they got there, he got some treatment and then he came to.  Then he told them the story of how it happened.  At that time he was under the Lesotho policemen guard.  \n While he was still under guard, in the second week while he was still in hospital, he was not being treated. He was only given pain-killers.  They were not preparations, like doctors usually do to treat a bullet wound. On the second week he was removed from the ward that he was in and \nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n8 D Z MAQEKEZA\nhe was put under a certain window.  So he asked why are you shifting me.  So they said no, this is the best place for you.  They just gave him a flimsy excuse.  So he used to complain to the sisters and doctors but they all ignored it.   On a certain day, it was very early in the morning, around seven, apparently a certain man arrived at that window and shot him and finished him.  That was the end of him.\n Then again I received another call. Somebody told me that your brother now is dead.  But now we didn't know what to do.  We tried to call the head office of the ANC because at this stage we didn't know what to do.  The whole family had a meeting and we decided now to go and fetch the body and we did.  We came and we buried the body in November.",

When he opened the door, when he looked out, there are so many policemen, they were all armed. He asked what is going on, what is the problem.  They said we are looking for your son, Boy, and Umvili Nogono, the one called KK, where are they?  Show us.  The other one said yes, Boy is here,\nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n12 D Z MAQEKEZA\nbut I don't know where Umvili Nogono is here  I know he usually comes here with Boy, but I don't know if he is here today.  So he led them.  They went into the house that they were sleeping in.  He pointed at them, he said here is his house that they usually sleep in.  Then Mr Jafta said that is when now the bullets started to be shot.  KK got out.  H was running.  He went into the garden.  The garden is situated right at the back of the houses and there was long grass in that garden.  Apparently that was the beginning of the battle which lasted for 36 hours between Umvili Nongono, known as KK and these policemen and their soldiers from South Africa and from the Transkei.  \n I don't know the gentleman next to me, if he has anything to say about this.

I also want to say something to Dumisani Mafo.  We have great hope that the policemen in the Eastern Cape Province is going to change from other provinces.  When we are in PE the MEC for Safety and Security in the Eastern Cape, came to the Commission to make his statement.  According about the violation of his human rights by the police.  Today we have a permanent secretary serving in the same department of the safety and security, also here today, to make evidence to this Commission, dealing with the violation of human rights. I think we are lucky, because in other places people usually cry out that the people who are the violators of the human rights are the high officials in the safety and security.  But today, the top managers of the police are the victims of human rights violations.   Now that gives us hope that the police in this province will be free from human rights violations.\nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE",
