I am glad that I can talk about Thembalethu today, he is my child.\n I have this to report. I would like to know who killed him.  Secondly, what did he do.  As a child who used to state what happened to him, even if we used to punish him as a child you would have an explanation of why you had to punish him.  That is why I would like to see the people who are the perpetrators. He was very young.  \n I can report that he was in Std 10.  Because of lack of means we couldn't take him further.  I have eight children and there are ten of us, including the parents.  He was the youngest.\n When he passed Std 10, I ordered him to go and seek employmen because I am an old-age pensioner.  You can realise that the pension is only meant for one person.  One person can only be supported with this, and then he agreed to go and seek employment.\n I took him to Ntlanzame and I knew that he would be staying in my houst at Ntlanzame because I own a house there, Unit 15, it is No 284.  Then I was sure and confident that he would be realised and would behave himself as an owner of the house. So I liked that he was going to be there. I also stated that I will arrange that he gets an \nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 M G JWAAI\nidentity document and then he agreed to that.  \n Then we went to East London.  There was a policeman who was a next-door neighbour, he was Mr Zelani and then I handed him over so that he can be assisted. This Zelani was a sergeant and then he asked whether he had documents. Then I admitted that he had none.  Then he promised that he would make arrangements. Thembalethu obtained the identity document. He was enrolled in the police force. \n He continued as a policeman.  During his off days he would come and visit us as a family.",

            "I think I should state this. I have a daughter who is a sister to Thembalethu. She was attending school\nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n4 M G JWAAI\nthere.  This is the report that I received from her.  She states that as usual Thembalethu went on duty because his shift was from six to two in the afternoon.  When he came back from work there was a van with one policeman. This person said, this person was light in complexion and he was bald.  Then I cannot remember his name.  This person said to Thembalethu I have come to fetch you so that you can go to work.  He was reluctant do go, but in the end he did agree to go together.  That is the last time when Thembalethu was seen.  Days passed and then they didn't hear anything about where Thembalethu is.  \n There were two policemen who came and reported that Thembalethu was shot dead and then the van in which he was travelling was burnt out.  They said please give us somebody who can accompany us to go to his father, because we do not know where to locate his father.  Fortunately there was somebody who was able and prepared to escort them. Then I received these bad tidings.  I was given the information that the van was also burnt out.  Then I said I will go to this place where he used to stay. I was ordered to go to the mortuary.\n The following day I went to the mortuary. When I got there I was ordered that I should identify bodies.  During this period I could see that his body was already spoilt and then there was only a skeleton left. I couldn't identify him because it was only the skeleton which was there.\n I had previously been to one of the persons who was keeping guard.  When I thought over, I could realise that for any person there is something with which you can identify him.  You know, the teeth of a person, it is not easy for the teeth to be burnt also.  So I called this \nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n5 M G JWAAI\nperson and said please come and be here with me.  Then I identified him with his teeth and then I signed for his body.  Then I received the death certificate.\n Thereafter I went to the scene of the accident.  When I got there I could find ashes but there was no van.  This was a surprise to me.\nThen I tried to think of what I can do. I am not familiar with the police. I am not famliar with any people and at times we would see the police, who covered themselves with blankets and rugs.  We would see people who would say they are afraid.  The place was not a happy one to be in.   I was able to see everything in this document.  When I looked through the document I see also a van. There was a red car next to the van, and I saw this in the photograph.  Apparently this car is the one which did this evil.  I have the document here with me. I keep this in my suitcase.  \n Ever since I got it I never knew that there would be a Commission, but God helped me that I should be wise enough to keep these so that I can refer always.  You can see the van, it is charred.  There is a car just next to it, it is a red car and I think the occupants were the people who did the evil to my son.\n Nobody knew about this car and it was said the people who did this, they ran away. Then there was somebody who came to say it was stolen and he had reported the car theft to the police.\n Commission, I can state that, I can give you a clue and this could help you.  Please go to the police who arrested him, who came to fetch him for work. He is the one who could give you information about all the details of what happened that day, because nobody knows what happened.\nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n6 M G JWAAI\n I know sometimes, even if a policeman is off duty, he is fetched when it is necessary.  But there is no explanation of what was happening, why was he called back.\n I went to see the sergeant who signed for the van, so that it can be issued to come and collect him.  But you could see that nobody was prepared to give me much information and details about what happened that day.\n I think you can realise that I am old now.  Even if I pause you must not be offended by that.",

I didn't understand that I was sending condolences to the family, and I was praised by my wife for what I did.\n When I went back to my family, everybody was very happy, because I had made and cited examples which were strenghtening and supportive to my family.  Even today, when they were crying at the time, they were looking at me.  You know, everybody knows that when there is anything which is bad, which has taken place at home, the father is the one who is looked at.  The funeral was well-prepared and I am proud to say that there were no problems. \n The people were also meeting and they have gathered in my house and everybody was here to listen to me and then they wanted to hear all the arrangements during that time.

I said no, \nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n10 M G JWAAI\nthis was impromptu but I was able to state my feelings.

The government and the officer.  Unfortunately my son died before all these could be arranged properly. Nobody knew that he was going to die.  He also didn't know that he was going to die.  So I would like him to get his benefits.  \n Thirdly, I am an old-age pensioner, which is inadequate. I have got a big family and I am left with the seven survivors and eight, including the mother. We are struggling very much, because my son was beginning to maintain and support the family. I had confidence in him. Because he would bring his whole salary to me.\n I have these requests to make. The Government should please help me and assist me in the maintenance of the family. Even if they can exclude my wife, although she is regarded to be very young, I am going to share with her this pension that I am getting.  I would like the Government to assist me with the school requirements in connection with my children.  My last-born is doing Std 1.  The little one said he would like to get R2,50 because the lady teacher said he is going to beat me if I don't bring the money. I ask what is the money meant for? He said it was meant for the school fees.  I would like the Government to take over and assist me.",

But each time when we go and find out about it, it is said that nothing has been received.  So I stated that then to these officials who are working at the magistrate's offices, I would like to have the file so that I can present it to the Commission. I was informed that no, the file was taken by the police and they took it to the Commission. I realise that they were just deceiving me.\nI believe that I am the one who was supposed to take the file and bring it to you. I didn't think that the police could take that responsibility for me.
