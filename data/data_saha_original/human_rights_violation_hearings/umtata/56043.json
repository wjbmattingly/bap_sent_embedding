We have two children, Nolita and Amanda.  When I first met with my husband he used to work in the Department of Prisons, that's why he was a policeman. He started working there in 1972.  Now in 1976 when the Transkei Defence Force was started, that's the time when the Transkei got its independence. He was in the first group that was trained for the Army.  He really loved his job.  Such that he became the head of the intelligence section very early in his career.",

            "His colleagues were, I can mention the four front ones, Gen Holomisa, Derek Mkwebe, Maj Zwahiba and Titzi\nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n2 MRS DULI\nMantanzima.  \n He used to work with very much are in his work, but he was a quiet person.  He was also a man of action.  He didn't say much, he used to be a very quiet man, but he was a man of action.   Even in the Army he portrayed that kind of character and he used to work harmoniously with his colleagues.\n Take an example of this harmony I am talking about.  In 1986 or '87, if I am not mistaken, Gen Holomisa was arrested.  He was accused of meeting Sandile from Ciskei so that they can betray the service for R250 000,00.  \n Now my husband was arrested at the time by the Selous Scouts who were working here at the time.  My husband, at the time, was the fore front one to release Holomisa. It is my husband who formed a committee which was called an Action Committee.  The very committee that was active in releasing Holomisa.  My husband was leading in that committee. I am just trying to show you here the harmony my husband used to work in.\n This harmony continued until 1980, 1988, I'm sorry.  Now the following arrived.  Titzi Mantanzima, Gen Holomisa, Derek Mkwebe, Maj Zwahiba and Capt Sobwowa.  Then later there was a coup d'etat.  At the time Stella Sigcau was the leader of the country. I am not going into details how that happened, but at the time when they did this coup, Stella was the leader of the country.\n Later we heard that there were these trucks in the streets announcing that there has been a coup and there is a new leader.  \n They started now in the government.  It was Gen Holomisa who was the leader, below him was my husband. I \nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 MRS DULI\nliked this, because there was this harmony that prevailed. If Gen Holomisa would come to my house he would even come to my bedroom.  They would go on with their conversation.  I am just trying to show you that if somebody is used and he is a friend in the family, they just come into the house, they don't care where it is.  That's how the relationship used to be.",

            "They used to hide together in a room and talk about their own issues.  But my husband traditionally in Xhosa, that's what we usually do, he didn't involve me much in their business conversations.  But I was fortunate to get a document which was handwritten by him.   I am sure you have that document with you.  That document has details on how this coup happened.\n One of the reasons why they started this coup was the political unrest in the country, that's all in that document that you have.  The weakness of that present government at the time and the lack of public protection.  According to that document that you have, that I found in my house, written by my husband. The decisions they came to when they were talking about, was just a short period of government, which is not going to be more than six months.  Much closeness to how the government is going to be run, administrative and security issues, all political matters should be given to the public, all the black vehicles should UMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n4 MRS DULI\nnot be used of the government, and it was going to be difficult to leave the government. Those were the decisions that were written in these documents that I found in my house.\n This harmony I was talking about continued.  These people were in the government.  They used to take overseas trips. Now I am talking about Gen Holomisa and my husband.  Things started to change and the tensions started in 1989.   On the 25th of April 1989, I heard that my husband has resigned from the military council.  Now on the 26th of April my husband received a letter of suspension from his work.  While I was still shocked with this whole situation, something that shocked me most on the 27th of April 1989, the fact that he was arrested.  \n On the morning of his arrest he called the general. At the time I was just next to him.  He said to me he was talking about me, asking the general to take care of me. I am there next to him while he was talking about me. The general knows this.  But at the time I wasn't aware that he was talking about me, so that I can be taken care of while he will be arrested.",

            "He said to me, at the time there were many people who were being arrested and one of them, people like Vanda, Mr Moletsana, and others that I cannot remember now, especially that side of Ghamada and (indistinct).  He said to me that he was being connected with these people, because they wanted the government to go back to the people.  That's what he said to me.  He was then taken by this cousin, he\nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n5 MRS DULI\nwas arrested, but I don't know where he was arrested until much later. I was quite shocked by this.  \n So quickly I went to Gen Holomisa. I said to him, but you have been working so harmoniously together, what happened.  He said to me no, Tobsi, you can't know everything.  He didn't give me any details, but he assured me that my husband will not be arrested for long. But he just reminded me that the reason why I am still alive is because of my husband.  He said to me no, Craig is going to come back, he won't be away for long.  \n But because I was still too shocked by this, I also went to Titzi Mantanzima, also asking him, what happened, what is going on now.  Titzi said to me there is a friction now between these two men, such that he even tried to have another meeting with them. That is now the general and my husband. He said he did try to meet with them, to find out what is going on now, why are they not united any more.  They each give me reasons.  But then he told me now the reasons why my husband was arrested. Apparently he was also connected with the people that I have mentioned before.  But I was told no, it won't be long.  \n I tried to get lawyers to get an interdict, because I was not allowed to go and see him.  The last time I saw him was on the 27th of April. He used to write letters to me, sending them to me, saying that no, I must endure, he will come back.  He has been trying to plead that he must be treated like another human being.  All this time trying to, they were trying to reassure me about my husband.  \n I even went to the security at Botha Sigcau, asking why isn't he being charged, I mean it has been a long time now.  My husband was never charged, since the 27th of April.  He \nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n6 MRS DULI\nwas then released through an interdict on the 18th of December.   \n During this whole time of his arrest, I have been getting certain reports about he is now in hospital.  Since I have been married to him he has never been to hospital, he was never a sickly person. He has been perfectly healthy all this time. This is why I was so worried now. I was even asking the securities why is my husband now in hospital.  Then I was told that he was suffering from depression, he was dehydrated, things like that.  \n Then my husband got out through an interdict on the 18th of December. Things were starting to be very bad at this time.  There were many stories about what is going on. Now the reasons of my husband's arrest, I have mentioned them here in this document. One of them was, is because he was meeting with KD Mananzima, because they wanted to have democracy again, away from the military.  \n The disgrace of being charged by Gen Holomisa and that disgrace was started by my husband.  It looks like that was another reason. Again, it was said that it was my husband who caused that there must be an investigation of theft and corruption by the Minister of Agriculture at the time. So this is why now my husband was also arrested.  I am not sure how true that was, but he was such a quiet man.  \n When my husband was released on the 18th of December, I received news that he got out against Gen Holomisa's will, such that Gen Holomisa was very angry about this.  I also received information about the fact that my husband's life was not safe any more. I went to fetch him from Lusikisiki.  He went to Aliwal-North, that is how we parted.  That is how he got out of Transkei. He was running away for his life \nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n7 MRS DULI\nfrom the Transkei, because his life was in danger.  During that whole time he was still a soldier.",

            "Yes, he went to Aliwal-North and that is how we parted and then I came back to the Transkei.\n We met every now and then, but at the time I was not just relaxing. I wasn't happy about the absence of my husband.  \n I went to Botha Sigcau, to Kenneth Lengwebe.  I said to him I do not like the fact that my husband is running away from home, I would like the friction between himself and Gen Holomisa to be solved.  I asked Kenneth Lengwebe have you forgotten the fact that in the action committee he is the very one who caused the release of Gen Holomisa, why is he now in danger.  So Gen Holmisa said to me no, he was going to go with me and meet my husband.  But when he came back he didn't tell me any, give me any reports.\n I said to Holomisa no, I don't like this.  Even then he didn't give me a straight answer.  He said to me no, he doesn't have much knowledge of this.  \n In short, I would like to make this story brief.  The week of my husband's death I heard on the 22nd of November, on this particular morning I was on my way to work. I didn't know anything. I just started to check out my child who was writing his/her Std 10 exam. I went to Holy Cross. When I got there there was a car that was surrounded. I could \nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n8 MRS DULI\nnotice that there were soldiers who were patrolling around.  When I asked I was told no, it is Duli's matter. I was so shocked. I don't know how I went back home.  At the time my child was writing her exams in tears.  They kept on giving my child coffee, just to sustain my child.  \n I used to listen to the events over the radio, even the events of this day, where it was announced on the radio.  Titzi Mantanzima told the country that they were still negotiating, they said no, they are going to shoot to kill, because my husband is not prepared to come forward. \n It is now at this time one of the Ghobozi family said Tobsy, you are the only person who can save Craig's life, stand up.  Go to Gen Holomisa, ask to speak to Craig, so that Craig can come forward to save his life.  Then we can all know what happened between himself and Holomisa.  Indeed, I stood up.  But there were there soldiers.  We didn't get a chance to speak to the general. \n Instead of meeting the general we were sent to the camp. It was utmost chaos. Even now, even now, even too many people and too much noise still affects me psychologically. It started on that day.  \n On that day I was with my children.  To be short, I didn't get a chance to speak to the general. Instead they took Ghobozi and they beat him up. He was on his stomach.  It was only Kenneth Mkwebe who helped him.  We were put into a car and then we were taken back home.  \n On my way home one of the soldiers tried to console me. He said to me Topsy, don't cry so much, we know Craig's work, he was with this man, today we are really going to find out what is the cause of this friction between the two of them.  That consoled me.\nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n9 MRS DULI\n Then I stayed at home. While I was still at home, there was an announcement on the radio by the general, he was on the stadium.  He said Craig has come forward, Craig has surrendered, so he is going to tell us now what he has been doing all this time.  I was so relieved, I was thanking God for the fact that he was still alive.  I was so happy because now that it was going to forwar, this whole conflict was now going to be exposed.  I was also going to know what is going on between these two men.\n While I was still listening over the radio, the general said here is the latest news: Craig, Craig Duli has passed on.  That was the last time I heard anything.\n They took me to hospital. I couldn't believe this.  Even, it is because I just heard over the radio that he has surrendered and now I was told that he has died.  \n In short, I am told that he was taken out of what is (indistinct) by Kenneth Mkwebe.  When it was announced that he has died, Kenneth Mkwebe simply fell, he fainted. I  think it was shock.  \n In short, after the death of my husband, there was a lot of chaos for three days. All three days his body would be put over there, people even say that on the third day it was getting decayed now.",

            "My husband's body was put in the camp.  It was displayed in the camp.\n Things got very difficult for me, especially the funeral.  People who came to the funeral were turned back. All the people who wanted to come to the funeral couldn't come, because they were very scared.  \n Now after my husband has been buried, soldiers arrived \nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n10 MRS DULI\nat my place to come and fetch his uniform and some of the intelligence documents and other documents and other things, which belonged to the Army. I gave all of that to them.  \n I gave them all the things that they wanted.  Then I went to the Botha Sigcau Building. After a while, I went, because I wanted what was his rights.  Then I was told there was no package for him.\n Now the rights that I am talking about were his pension and other things that were rightful to him. But I was told that no, I was not going to get anything, but I am just going to get a contribution which was worth R21 000,00. I was told that even the costs of trips overseas were also going to be deducted from the same R21 000,00.\n Now the reason why I am here before you today.  After a while, after my husband has died, even the way that my husband died was quite suspicious.  I decided to go to Botha Sigcau offices again.  I heard that the murder and robbery squad was also involved in taking him out of Botha Sigcau. It was led by Gen Umlau. \n I gave myself a chance, because I wanted to find out exactly what happened to my husband.  Mbulawa told me that Gen Umlau at that time had three policemen with him.  I didn't know these other two, but the other was Mr Mbulawa. It was Mr Lee Mliwana, the other one.\n Gen Molawa told me that he didn't feel free to talk to me about this, but it was painful what he saw in the camp. Apparently my husband went to the camp.  He was slightly injured, but what Mbulawa saw was that he was told to turn and look this way.  He said sit down, I am going to talk to you and tell you why I am doing this.  He said I haven't anything against the Transkeians, the only one that I am\nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n11 MRS DULI\nagainst is this one, and he also knows this. I don't want to be the leader of the country.  So they said turn and look that way.  That is how he was shot, while he was still pleading and that was the end of him.  That happened in the camp.\n What Mbulawa told me is exactly what the post-mortem was.  It was exactly.  His heart ruptured, his lungs were also ruptured. That is how, that is according to the post-mortem.  \n Now the reason why I am here, before this Commission, is because I feel like my husband should have been taken to the courts of law, so that he can defend himself.  Who killed him and why he killed him?  What was so secretive, because it was obvious that he was going to disclose the secret.  It was now the time for him to say what was the problem with him and his friend, Gen Holomisa. \n I feel I didn't get all that was rightful to my husband, I didn't get all those, things like pensions and  all the other money that was rightful to him. I also feel that I do qualify to receive the widow's pension fund, which my husband used to contribute to.",

There was a friction between the TDC and myself, because of certain situations at work.  Then I was expelled from work, through what was called a disciplinary action. When I complained about this, it was all in vain.   In short, in my efforts trying to go up and down, trying to go back to work, I asked Gen Holomisa - in fact he was trying to ask everyone he said anyone who knows anything about corruption must come forward.  So I did, I had my documents.  Documents which exposed all this corruption that was happening in this corporation.  It looked like nobody had taken care of this.  They simply ignored it.  It looked like the military government was not looking for the truth, they just took over the government, because they wanted to do away with the corruption.\n That is when I met Col Craig Duli.  He said my case must started over again, but then it was found that I was never guilty right from the very first.  Again, I met Lieut Craig Duli. I asked him a lot of questions, especially about them, but it looked like there was a certain \nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n13 MR VHANA\nmisunderstanding.  He did say to me please, Madiba - that is my clan name - don't go on investigating these things, I am going to fix all this; I am going to talk with these other men, then we will fix everything for you.\n By fixing this, he meant bringing democracy back to the people.  It is because I said to him the reason why you took over the government from Stella Sigcau is because you said it is because Stella Sigcau said to you from the self-defence department, you were corrupt. The other reason why you took Stella Sigcau from the government is because the Pondos were killed by Lieut-Colo Vakashiyo - who is dead now - together with his brother.

I ask for forgiveness from our ancestors.  Even for those heroes who fell on that day, even on the same day.  I didn't want this to happen. Even as I didn't want this to happen that all those fallen heroes should fall because of bullets that came from us.  We did not kill anyone, because we were told not to kill anyone. Now what was puzzling to me was, to be given firearms from Yolo, but I didn't know what to do with these firearms but at the time we didn't even have a chance to ask questions.
