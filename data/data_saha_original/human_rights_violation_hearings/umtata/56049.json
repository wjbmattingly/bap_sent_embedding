We know that's what happened about your husband when you gave your evidence you did not doubt, you were not complained, you didn't even complain about his struggle that he was involved in, the only thing that you would like to know is what happened to your husband because your husband was involved in the struggle he could be living today.\n We know that without your assistance and your support we should salute you for that because we couldn't have been able to continue with the struggle were it not assistance and support.

            "Rex Luphondwana was born ...(indistinct) and he was brought up there and then he went to Loveday to attend school but he was expelled and then he completed matric at Newell and then thereafter he was a student at Fort Hare University.\n In 1963 whilst he was still a student at Fort Hare he was arrested for sabotage. He was charged for five years under the Sabotage Act and then he went to Robben Island to serve the sentence for five years. After his release he was under house arrest for six years for being a member of an unlawful organisation and then he was stationed at Cradock. After that he was starting with UNISA and then he came a graduate who has passed a Law Degree and then there was a problem to get him registered for Articles and then he came here in the Transkei. Matabese was the relative and then he was the one who assisted him to serve the Articles. He then joined Mr Nchika. During this period he was already a member of the ANC. \n When I met him in 1978 we then got married in 1979. We had two children, Mtimkulu and Ncumisa. He was always a lawyer who defended political cases, I cannot count them because I can think I can make sure the one involved Chief Sabata, he defended Chief Sabata when the Chiefs here were against Sabata. They were very close together and then he would say he is a servant to the Chief. At times they would come together at night and then you would find that they were slightly under the influence and they were enjoying themselves. They would continue and talk for hours on end and then they would leave the place at times and then even when he was in Lesotho, when he is called by the Chief, he would request me to accompany him to the Chief Sabata's place in Lesotho. There were these people like Mr Kati, Steve Traykay and some others and the would go to Umtulugwenche. He had to go in and out the country and visit the Chief in Lesotho.",

            "Yes, during the weekend on which he died, he said to me on Thursday, \"I am supposed to go to Cradock tomorrow because there is a very important issue that I have to attend to\". I didn't probe because I knew there were so many urgent issues that he has to take or give attention to, even now because there was usually such things, so I just agreed that he should go. I requested that he should take me home because I was a bit ill, so he took me along and took me to the family. The following day on the Saturday, which was the 7th, Professor Manganyi was his best friend paid a surprise visit because he didn't inform, this was unexpected and then I said he should be accommodated. We made preparations to accommodate him because we loved him also and then they were visiting Bikitsha for the afternoon and then they wanted to spend the afternoon with this Boy Bikitsha at Norwood. We had a very good time together and then Manganyi and my husband spent the afternoon together. They used to call each other brother-in-law because they were very close and the other thing, one of them Manganyi was married to the person with the same clan name as him. I was not fetched from home although my husband had returned from where he went to. This I didn't question or query because I knew that when he was with his friends then I would just tolerate that he should enjoy himself with them. Again then when he didn't turn up the following day, it was drizzling, I didn't question again because I knew that he might have been spending a good time with his friends. I phoned again and said to my helper that she should go to the room and request that my husband should phone me and then when he came back he said - \"no, there is a visitor, Rex is not there\". \"Where is he\", she said \"no, I don't know\" and then I said no, \"go to Noel where he has put up for the night\" and then he called him to the telephone. Like any other woman I was a bit jealous, I wanted to be able to state that I was a bit concerned. My husband never used to going out and sleep overnight away from home, although he was not an angel, I can't say he was an angel but he respected his family. You know when this happened they exchanged views and they would go and get girlfriends for each other and this was just as expected and accepted by me as a joke. I also asked Noel, where is my husband, he said he doesn't know. I insisted that he must go and fetch him where he left my husband. This continued for quite a long time we were arguing over the telephone and he just said, \"just leave me alone, I don't know where your husband is\", then this continued then at the end he would just drop the telephone. I kept on phoning alternating between the home and the office for the whole day I was doing this. At quarter past nine in the morning I was at home. Dr Mngqibisa came to our place and he asked \"Where is Noqgili\", because Noqgili is me and then I jumped thinking that it was my husband. When I looked out it was Mr Mngqibisa and then I asked he what are you here for. He said \"you are my patient\". I said you are a Doctor but I asked you what do you want. At the end I informed him that I am very angry and then he asked \"why are you angry\", I said \"do you know we are looking for him, I have been phoning the home and also at work, I am just asking myself what is happening, because I don't like people who are irresponsible\", and then Dr. Mngqibisa said, \"I've come for that\". \"What is it?\". It was reported that between ten and eleven he was discovered. Then my first reaction was that I was surprised why was I not informed of what happened and then I made inquiries to find out whether he was hospitalised and then they said \"No\".",

I was shocked and I wanted to know what happened and then it was said it was a stationary bus which was next to the road. It was said to me it was a bus which had a trailer. Even in papers it was reported as a bus which had a trailer and then it was next to the road, it was stationary there and then he is alleged to have bumped the bus. Then during this period the people who were coming and bringing condolences and then it was said this they learnt that there is a prominent lawyer who was involved in an accident.

Because they were surprised how could they hear over the radio that their son was deceased. They were not aware that we were also not informed. The other thing that I am thinking is that even the police were supposed to have come and informed us because we believed that it was their duty to do so when there is a car accident.\n Rex Luphondwana was very popular, and he was known, he was a known figure and a prominent figure here and even the police knew him, but I can just say maybe it's because he was controversial. It was only Monday when this took on, there were prayers, people giving support, condolences and everything but we were surprised why were we not informed between ten and eleven because we learnt only the following day at past nine. On Tuesday we were informed that there were belongings which were brought in here in my place. It was very strange because there were no indications of any struggle, there were no indications of any accident because the clothes were in tact, there was not even blood on the clothes and then I went with Mrs Tshlali, the late Mrs Boltina who was my neighbour, Mrs Bikitsha and my sisters we went to the mortuary.

Then we proceeded with the funeral. When we were continuing with the funeral there were just Boers all over the place, there were colleagues who were afraid - his colleagues were afraid to come and everybody disappeared, everybody who was on the programme didn't come. Nobody turned up, Moniwa was the MC and then I felt very bad because that person apparently we realised later on that he was a Security Officer because he was the one who took over as the Master of Ceremonies because the people didn't turn up because they were afraid of the Security Officers. After the funeral you could hear all the rumours, there were some of the people who said \"that whore, that whore who is his wife has killed him\", the others said \"I bewitched my husband\" and then I said I will build a wall around myself. I didn't want anybody and my personality changed at the time, I was a very humble person but from the day when the people were just saying bad things about me, made me to realise that you couldn't trust anybody. Some of the people would come to me as friends but I would be knowing what the people have said about me in my absence at my back. Most of the people became back-biters and I had no friends at the time, but this I could take it as something which is petty, I cannot just delve much on it. In 1992, I was following this Goniwe case, Luphondwana and the Goniwe's were the people who were very close to each other and I believe that when he was going to Cradock I suspect he was going to them.",

He was very busy because I knew what he was doing is in Lesotho was the ideologies of the ANC so that is why I didn't probe when he didn't tell me what he was doing there. Thank you very much.",

You are a symbol of many women in this country whose testimonies will never die. You mentioned that following the death of your husband you were traumatised even by some people whom you trusted. We hope this experience of breaking the silence before the Commission is the beginning of re-healing and recovery. We hope you will confidently share with other women, educate and enlighten about the experience of losing your beloved one in a mysterious manner and you have left a challenge with this Commission to work hard and assist the Community of women of this Country who are living with a similar experience of not knowing what happened to their dear fathers and husbands.
