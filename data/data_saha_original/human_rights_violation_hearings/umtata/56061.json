            "The reason why I went to Cape Town, I went to look for work.  At the time I was a member of Mr Mandela's organisation, that is the ANC.  The reason why I joined the ANC was because he was so tortured.  That was the first thing.  The reason why I went to Cape Town is I was tortured inside by the fact that he was tortured.  His torture affected me inside.\n Then I was offered employment in Woodstock.  But then I was arrested and my uncle found me at Pollsmoor. At the time I was arrested for the pass, because I didn't have my pass. I was still working. While I was still working they also fetched me again.  The same place where I was working. I was again arrested and put in Pollsmoor.  These boers were still asking me tell us, man, we don't trust you very much, which organisation are you affiliated with.  I said I am in the same organisation as Mandela.  They said to you know him. I said yes, I know him. Where does he come from? I said he comes from Umtata.  Then after that they left.  I slept.\n My uncle came in the morning, trying to release me, because he was under the impression that I was arrested under the pass laws.  But they said no, I was not there. That is what they said, the boers, they said I was not there, Phulula is not here.  \nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 B T PHULULA\n Then I went to a court at Observatory.  While I was still in the police van, I had been beaten up, they were still beating me up.  They were competing in beating me up. I told them, even when I got there, I said I am still saying the same thing, but I was saying then, I told them that I come from the rural areas, I am from Umtata, and I didn't know that by coming to Cape Town I have sinned, because I know that Cape Town is still South Africa, I am not from overseas.  But now apparently now the magistrate now didn't like what I was saying.  Then he said no, I must be taken down, I must be taken down from the courts, from the stand, I was beaten up so much that day, I wished for the sun to come up. I was beaten up the whole night. They tried all kinds of things to torture me.  That whole week they used to come just to beat me up only.  \n Then on the second week, they took me again.  They fetched me from my cell.  Then I said you murderers, there is no other thing that you came to fetch me here for, you only want to kill me. Because it looks like to me then that you are murderers, that is the only thing that you know here.  You came here under the pretext that you are preachers, because you came with a Bible, and you made us to believe in the Bible, and now you have shown your true colours.  You are now murderers, we can now see that.  I know that you are murderers.  Then the magistrate said no, this one must go straight to Mandela, he thinks the same way as Mandela.  I said yes, I am still saying this to you that you are murderers, I know that you want to kill me, you want to drown me.",

The doctor who was taken care of me was Dr Bekker at the time.\n Let me continue.  I stayed in the prison for too long. I didn't even get food sometimes. I would sleep without anything to eat.  Things got better when one man from Gauteng, his clan name is Dlamini, I can't remember his name. I was with him in the cell.  I found out now that we were thinking the same way politically.

When I got out I saw that there was a van, a police van outside. I got in. They said go in \"kaffer\".  Still, they still continued beating me up.  This one, my cell mate, they did the same thing to him, they beat him up again.  Then there was another man from another\nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n5 B T PHULULA\ncell but I think he was from Ciskei.  Then we were three in this police van.  While I was still looking at that, there were women now, four women coming from the women's side.  They were put in the cell that we were.  Nobody was asking anyone about anything.  I just said to the other men, now we are going to be killed.  I said these people who are pretending to be preachers and believers of God are now going to kill us, Dlamini, let's pray our own prayers, let us use our ancestors' God, Khamata. Then we started to pray in the police van.  The van went on. It passed through De Aar.  It went through Prieska.  I said to Dlamini, Dlamini, I am looking for, I just want to escape, do you know any place here.  \n We came across a big river. I said to Dlamini, where are we going.  He said to me, you see, Duma, when we are here, we are going into the Ovambos, to the Ovambo area, which is in the North West, in the South West Africa.  When we get there, when we get out we must just grab their guns, we must not give them any chance, we must just grab their guns. Even if one us gets shot, but let us just grab their guns.  Then what happened.  We went through another town which I think was for Vendas.  I did not know these places. I used to ask Dlamini next to me.  We got there around half past one. That was now in Tzaneen.  I can still have its picture in my head.  They put in petrol into their car.  They said to us here are Xhosa-speaking men. They said to us you guys are going to be killed, you are not going back to your homes.  That's when I started being shocked.  They said what are you saying, I said what are you saying. They said there have been many Xhosa people who have been passing here, they don't come back, you are also not coming back; I \nUMTATA HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n6 B T PHULULA\nam advising you Xhosa people, when these lions approach you, do not run away from them, because they are used to this.  Don't run away from these lions, you are going to be introduced to some lions. I said to Dlamini, let's pray again.  Then we started to pray together with these four women.  \n The police van passed the Tzaneen town. I again asked Dlamini.  Dlamini said no, we are in Angola.  This is now Angola and this is Maputo in front of us.  That other side is Tzitzikamma. I said where are we being taken to Dlamini, where are we going to be killed at, are they taken us so far away that even our families cannot even retrieve us any more.\n Anyway, the van continued. It went deep into the forest. It went on and on and on. Now Dlamini told me that we are now very near Maputo.  It stopped and it was trying to station properly.  It was now facing back where we were from. It was not around three pm.",
