<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Of these homelands of this homeland Government, when everybody was talking about freedom, it was at the time when the Governments were looked down upon, at that time, at the time your husband died, when he was trying to fight for the country, but he didn't die, his death was not in vain, at least there was a message for him, now I am going to give you a chance. Your husband didn't die in vain, my sister, we also thank you for coming over here so that we can tell the whole country, so that all the generations can be able to say, "we will never again do something like this, never again will these things happen again to us", at the time now we will be able to say, to recognise the dignity of a human being. We understand that your husband wasn't just struggling on his own, you were also part of this. I would like to make you take the oath. Could you please stand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">NOMBASA SANGONI:</span> (duly sworn in states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Nombasa in the statement before us, we see that you are going to give statement about the death of your husband who died on the 5th February 1988. Could you please take a minute to tell us about yourself, your family and your husband. Please tell us so that we can be able to know, who, what kind of a man he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MS SANGONI:</span> Zolile Sangoni is the son of Mr and Mrs Sangoni, at the time of his death he was working at the SAB in 1988. He used to be committed very much in the struggle, he was a member of the ANC at the time. A man, a Mr Zokqua, was a friend of his at the time. Lots of things happened in Butterworth at the time, we used to be detained lots of times because we used to stay together. At another time he was detained for two weeks, I was also detained with him and then I was released on the second week. Now because of policeman like Madikizela from Butterworth, now before prior his death he used to be warned by this Madikizela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Why did Madikizela warned your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MS SANGONI:</span> My husband and Madikizela used to know each other. Madikizela used to just pretend to be my husband's friend, but knowing that he was trying to get information from my husband, at the time he used to, he used to yell at his name and say Zolile, and then warn him, and after that they killed Temba Lozokwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Let's go back to the time when this incident happened here in Umtata, do you know why your husband was here in Umtata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MS SANGONI:</span> On the 7th of February 1988, he woke up very early but he had a problem with his car, that's why now he left his car and he used the Honda Ballade which was brown. He was going to Umtata because he was a rep of the SAB. On his way to Umtata he gave Thozamile Nkume a lift, he was also resided in Umtata. They both went to Umtata. When they got to Umtata there was another man who he was detained with, a Mr Mayaphi, now this man, they were going to see this man in jail Mr Mayaphi, there was another housed that they used to stay in at Mbokwe, the policemen came to this house and they just sprayed the whole house with bullets, thinking that my husband and his friends were in the house. Now around lunch time, around 1.00pm my husband called me just before lunch, called me, telling me that he was coming back to Butterworth, so during lunch time they decided to have a braai at Ncambedlana, at Mbuqe. Now on their way to the braai, they saw a white 4 x 4 and another white Kombi also with tinted windows, Number Plates - XF. There were four in the car, it was himself, Zona Wetle, Thozamile Nkume, Zonwabele Mayaphi and another one, and also Zolila Sangoni and there was another man called Gift, I can't remember his another name, he is the one who used to say "do you guys see that we are being followed", when they got to Mnado they braai'ed, they continued with the braai and then from there, from the braai spot, this Kombi and this 4 x 4 was also following them, still watching them. The Kombi started to flicker at them, then Zolile started saying "you guys, do you know who knows anything about this Kombi, because now it was starting to flicker at them. One of them answered "No, we don't know anyone in that Kombi. Again the Kombi started to flicker and then later they started to stop. The Kombi's also stopped, Zolile was still in the car, the sliding door of the Kombi now was started to open, there was a flood of bullets, it was non-stop. It seemed like the reason why they shooting like this, they didn't want anybody to survive in the car. The bullet shells that were found there were more than 30. Most of these bullets were aimed at him, this is now, why now he couldn't survive he died on that spot and this other man Mr Mayaphi who was in pain, now this people from this 4 x 4 and the Kombi ran away, left him there, one of them was Mbulelo Wana and the other one was Madliwa and Captain Le Roux. There were other three girls who were in this Kombi that they didn't show. One of those girls was Ntlola Shosha. The Transkeian police arrived on the scene but they didn't want anybody to be taken out of the car, now while the man was still in excruciating pain, they were still asking them questions, they were asking to be taken to hospitals, but the police didn't care at all. At a later stage they were taken to hospital, but only one survived, the other three were already dead. The pathologist who was taking care of the bodies described that the bullets as strong as to pierce an iron rod, it was my first time to see a person who has been shot such that a bone was hanging outside, that's how my husband Zolile was, he was shot in the thigh, the way he was swollen he looked like a pig, it was because of all the bullets that were sprayed all over his body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> About the people who shot them, it looks like a there was a place that they went to. Do you know this place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS SANGONI:</span> Yes, the police who shot my husband and his friends ran over to the police, though they denied this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Then what happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MS SANGONI:</span> Weeks and months passed, we were trying to find out who were these people were, but later the police said it was Madliwa and the rest who did this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Now what happened to those people who shot - who fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS SANGONI:</span> There was an inquest and the inquest was about Madliwa, that's where Madliwa said when he was lying the reason why they were shooting at my husband and friends, they said they were having firearms within the car, but they are the one's who planted these firearms so that they can be able to say these firearms belonged to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Now did the inquest find out that these other people who killed your husband and friends?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS SANGONI:</span> Madliwa confessed, especially Madliwa he is the one who confessed he used to have smiles, especially when he was taking about saying that he is the one that killed them, and then after that he would smile, then after that Squia was very angry at him because he used to ask them "Are you happy about what you did, seeing that you are smiling so much". What hurts me about the inquest is that they were found guilty but there was nothing done about them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Was there any Court case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS SANGONI:</span> Yes, there was a Court case and they were found guilty, but they were not charged and they were not sentenced, in other words they are free they are still out there, yes, they are still out there, this is why actually why Madliwa was also shot, its because he was just roaming around out there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> About Thozamile Nkume who survived, do you know anything about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS SANGONI:</span> They found Thozamile Nkume at his place in his village, he promised me that he'll be here, but when we got there, we were told that yesterday that "No he has already left", so that is why Thozamile is not here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> I am sure you already have a wish by coming to the Commission, what is that wish?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MS SANGONI:</span> I wish the Truth Commission can discover and investigate for us who were those three ladies who were in that Kombi, why were they hiding them, because obviously they knew something, who were they.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Is there anything that we have left out that you think we should also touch before we conclude?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS SANGONI:</span> No, I don't think there is anything else that I have left out. And moreover, I have a request, if the Commission can help me, I have a child that I am still struggling to bring up and educate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> How old is the child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS SANGONI:</span> My child will be eleven years in September.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Thank you, we have noted your request.I am going to hand over to my colleagues, the Commissioners, to see if they have any questions for you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Ms Sangoni you said the advocates were advocate Skweyiya and who else was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS SANGONI:</span> It was advocate Skweyiya, there were two advocates but I have forgotten the other one, he was from Gauteng, but I have forgotten his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Reverend Nkondu, I want to make sure about something - you said there was a Court case - the case was set before the Judge - these people were found guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS SANGONI:</span> Yes, they were found guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> How many years were they sentenced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS SANGONI:</span> No, they were never sentenced - it was also said that they were found guilty but they were never sentenced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Is it the Judge of the Court that said that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS SANGONI:</span> Yes, it was a Judge from here in Umtata.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> I would like to know the circumstances around the funeral of your husband Zolile Sangoni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS SANGONI:</span> I wish that Zolile, I wish that the Commission can help me out with Zolile's tombstone, it was very difficult, so I would just like the Commission to help me out with husband's death  ..(tape ends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">PANEL MEMBER:</span> Nombasa, to lose your partner at the prime of your youth and to have the future of your marriage terminated at the time when you were looking forward to being together with your husband must have been very painful to you and I want to say that it was a great sacrifice that you and your husband made. I noticed that when you began to make your testimony your face, your eye, clearly conveyed that you loved your husband very dearly and I am sure that your husband also loved you, but your husband had another love and that was the love for this country and the love for justice and for that love he paid the ultimate price.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a> We salute you, we salute your husband, we salute the families -your family and your husband's family that supported you - but if I may on behalf of the Commission, I want to make a call, I want to make a call to those in authority who are still alive, who know what happened, to come forward and tell the Commission what they know.  I think one of the most painful things that keeps on coming up is that the people who are responsible for these things, live in our communities but they are not coming forward and there is going to be no healing, there is going to be no reconciliation until those people voluntarily come up and tell us what happened so that we can then propose a way in which reconciliation and forgiveness can take place. Policemen, especially policemen like us, Black as us, we ask them to please come forward, they mustn't wait until they are being called, they mustn't wait until their names are being called in these hearings, they must come forward voluntarily, they must come and they must tell the country what happened, not only about what is happening here, about was happening in the whole country so that we can attempt to forgive ...(inaudible)  mentioned then that is opportunity, but when they come before they have even been mentioned then indeed they will be showing that they are committed to reconciliation and to the truth. </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a> Thank you very much for what you have done and all the sacrifice that you have given, for all what you have given us we would like to tell you and we will give you assurance that we will try to meet and fulfil your wishes and needs and respect of the courage that you have shown as his wife.</p>
