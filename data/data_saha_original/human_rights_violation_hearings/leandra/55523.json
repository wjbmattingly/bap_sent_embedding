They were scared, I think they did not see me, because I was walking on the other side of the railway and they were walking along the street and these women went into Lucas's place.  Just after they got into Lucas's place I knocked and one of them jumped and ran away.  The other one mumbled something that I did not understand and also went out.  His wife was at work at that time.  Even the third one mumbled something that I did not understand and I felt very bad, because his wife was at work when these three women were in the house.  I went out and told my wife and after I had told my wife he, she also went there and she got an empty bottle of beer as well as a glass next to it.  The glass was also empty.  Before my son died he always wanted to drink beer, he also said beer.  He could not say all the other things, but he kept on saying beer, beer.  Maybe he was poisoned through beer or something.",
