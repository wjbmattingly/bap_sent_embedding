            "Nokuthula disappeared in 1983.  She was attending at the University of Swaziland.  Just when we were preparing to go and attend her graduation, that is when we discovered that she has disappeared and nowhere to be found.  We searched all over for Nokuthula and we never found Nokuthula.  Even at the border we went to enquire if she has crossed and to no avail.  Some in Swaziland said the ANC people sent her to the Republic and we went to the ANC people and they denied any knowledge of Nokuthula.  We searched everywhere.  Even the neighbouring countries like Botswana, we went to search for Nokuthula.  No one came to the surface to tell us about Nokuthula.  Even the policemen could not help us in that regard.\n In 1985 we decided to approach the press.  Her picture appeared in the newspaper and one police contacted us after seeing her picture on the newspaper and said he knew that girl, because he kept guard at that girl in Vlakplaas Police Station and the last time that police saw Nokuthula, Nokuthula was ill and she was severely and brutally tortured.  The investigation stated afresh now and the matter was under investigation.  The Investigating Officer, Neville Toms, investigated the issue further and until the final part of it, but they still could not give us any sound matter in as far as Nokuthula's issue is concerned.  All what we want now are her remains so we could bury Nokuthula in a decent way.  In our culture we bury people decently and we would like to do that.  \n Finally, we found out that the policemen who arrested her, two of them were suspended.  That they were suspended because they were investigating this matter.  That is Coetzee and Pretorius and the ones that we do not know are the other three, because all of them were five in number.  We found out that they have applied for amnesty.  Still when I heard about their application, amnesty application I heard that they applied, that they had kidnapped Nokuthula and tortured Nokuthula and that was the end.  They never mentioned any other thing beside that.  I would like to know even more.  What happened to my daughter and after the torture what was done to her.",

I understand that there have, as you indicate, that there are, in fact, five applications that have been made and we will hear from that, we hope, considerably more, because we understand very well the pain that you must have had all these years.  It is a pain not only that of feeling that your daughter has disappeared and you cannot reach her, but also of not knowing what actually happened to her and finally not being able to know how she died, where she died and where she has been buried.  We will certainly follow up, we will keep a very close link, close watch on the amnesty process.  We will also see what we can do further about following up with the ANC, because they must have some information about her and then, as you know, there is a programme within the Commission for reburial of loved ones.  So we will be in touch with you about all those three major points and I would like to thank you and your wife for having the courage to come today and tell us this story.  We sympathise very much with you and we will do what we can to bring you the information that you require.  Thank you very much for coming.",
