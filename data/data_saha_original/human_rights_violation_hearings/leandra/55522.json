We looked through the window and we could see that group approaching our house and they got to our house.  They had bottles, nip bottles and they started attacking us, throwing those bottles and stones over our house and we were inside the house at that time the two of us.  Suddenly the house was set alight.  The roof burst open and I decided to go outside to ask as to what was their problem and why they were attacking us.  As I tried to go outside they attacked me throwing stones at me and we decided to run away.  Outside there by, there was a car parked and he got inside then.  I went to the neighbours house and still looked at my house to find out exactly what was their intention.\n They were calling each other, yelling at each other saying hey, come this side, he is this side.  I saw Sipho Mpopo, I saw my boy inside looking for my husband and they were peeping through the door.  He decided to take another turn, my husband, and they went to him.  They got hold of him, they took him with.  There was a small route that connected to our house and they took that route.  I do not know what happened thereafter.  After quite some time my son, the one who is sitting next to me, came and told me that my husband was lying down there, the father and he tried to pick him up, but he failed.

            "I will carry on where my mum left.  That is where I found my dad lying down there and it was my friend who called me and said hey, your dad is lying down here.  We rushed there immediately and when we got there he was, as I said, he was lying down.  We picked him up and Sipho Mpopo they came suddenly and started assaulting me.  I ran away and there was this van that came and followed us in this route, small route I talked about.  I ran, we got to the rail line and there were police there.  I ran towards the police and de Vries was there.  I informed de Vries about my father's attack and told me that we should go to Priscilla Jana and your father is the one who has been telling us not to interfere with the location stuff.  I went back, I left the police alone.  I went to Magogo and I told my mother, I went to mum and I told my mum that I think dad has passed away now.  We slept at the neighbours house.   In the morning I went back to the police station.  I met Basson, the sergeant.  The van that had my, that took my dad was parked there in the police station and I told him that we should go approach the drivers of that van, because they should have the insight of the whole thing and Malohlo was there and Matini and they were washing out the van, because it was bloody.  I asked what is this blood for and they said, no, we had dogs inside.  We heard lambs inside so, the sheep, so that blood is coming from the sheep and I merely was asking.  I knew the truth, I knew that the blood was my fathers.\n At about four in the afternoon I met Richard and he told me that Mr Mayisa is down the road in, next to Kwarine.  I asked him where is Kwarine.  He told me that he was there lying down and covered by corrugated iron and we got there.  We found out that he was burnt.  They set him alight.  We left the scene and went back to the police station and we told them where the corpse was.  They followed us and took pictures of my father's body.  I asked what is the next step.  They said we should leave.  ... there and we wanted to know what was going to be done to him.  They called one another and now suddenly they started caucusing and we ask him, we asked the police what is going to happen of my dad and they insisted to tell us that we should leave and leave him alone.  \n Now on the funeral day, even just before, on the 27th of January we went to the school, school hall and then we went as a family to bury him.  ... just did not care about what was happening.  We approached a police and told them that they should give us this day to bury our father and they insisted that they will not help us in any way, but we were adamant.  Finally we carried on.  We went to the grave site.  When we got back they started attacking us.  Now they attacked the combi that I was driving.  Martin Zondo, Ndogo and Modise.  I approached de Vries to tell him that he was present when my combi was being attacked and he told me to go to Priscilla Jana and I went to her and those were convicted, the three of them.  \n De Vries and Malinga came to me and said they wanted to me to submit the statement and I told them that I went to see them and they took me for granted and told me that I should go and see Priscilla Jana, because my father was the one who was saying we should not or they should not interfere with the locations matters.  In June we were all taken as a family by de Vries and de Vries said myself and Nkabinde are, want to retaliate and want to kill the people who killed my father.  I asked Malinga as to what was happening.  He said he could not say a word to me and I am also losing my job as they are saying I am ANC member and I cannot carry on the operation effectively. I decided, no, let it be, whatever can happen.  Mum take over, there is nothing more I want to say.",

It seems as if part of the community then or some of the people in the community supported the idea of removal, supported Chief Minister Skosana and others ideas and that your late husband, Mr Nkabinde and others were really resisting it working for the interests as they saw it.  In your statement you refer to vigilantes, you refer to them as Inkatha.  At some place you even refer to them as freedom fighters, I think on page, well that is not important at the moment, but you even refer to them as freedom fighters.

            "Mrs Mayisa or Mr Mayisa, any one of you would be welcome to answer.  What is still confusing a little is that in the statement Mrs Mayisa says that the tension was due to the vigilantes, she refers to them or the Inkatha or whatever, did not want to know anything about chieftaincy.  Now that is foreign to my experience, because really the struggle, the liberation movement, the youth were more opposed, generally, to chieftaincy than were vigilantes or councillors or the structures.  So this is an out of the ordinary relationship where the Chief found himself on the side of the youth movement and the liberation forces.  Was it indeed something to do with the chieftainship, I just want to make sure or was it simply the alignment of the specific Chief with the liberation struggle?",

I would like to take up the point that Wynand Malan has made that in many ways this is an example of how far we are still to go in going along a road where communities live in peace together, but I would like to salute you for coming forward this afternoon in the way that you have done, because what you have done is made a contribution towards that.  It is still very painful, it is still very raw, it is still, as we can see from the public response, it is something that is still very much talked about in the community and is very important to the community, but by your coming forward you have made a contribution in how we can all move forward and how you particularly in this community can do so and work towards, as we are trying to do through the Commission, work towards a situation where communities do live in peace through understanding the past.  So I would like to thank both of you very much for coming forward.  Thank you.",
