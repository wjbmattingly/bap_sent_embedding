Then in the morning Aubrey went away together with the other children.  They went to the new bar that has been built and when they got there we heard later on, because I was at home, his mother had gone to Johannesburg, and I heard that there were some youths who had been shot and I remained at home.  Aubrey's mother came and asked as to whether we heard about the children who had been shot.  I told her that I had heard.  Then we proceeded and on that particular day he did not sleep at home.\n The following morning I went around looking for him and as I was looking for him I came across Mr Mahlangu and I wanted to find out from Mr Mahlangu as to whether Aubrey was not amongst the children who had been injured or shot.  He said he did not see him, but he had seen some of them, but there is another unknown male who had been shot and they did not know as to whose child that was and I proceeded to the police station.  When I got to the police station I got some soldiers who were standing outside the police station and they pushed me with the butts of their guns and they asked me as to what I wanted.  I said I had come to look for my son and they said I should go inside the police station.  When I got inside the police station I came across the Chief CID Officer and he instructed me to go and fetch the birth certificate.  \n I went home to fetch the birth certificate and when I came back he was talking to the soldiers.  They were arguing as to which person was I referring to and one of the soldiers said it is the one that I shot who was on top of a tank, I shot him.  This is what this soldier was saying and I was taken from that point.  We went to Evanda.  When we got to the Evanda they said I should open the drawers of the mortuary and identify him.  I positively identified him and when I got him I asked this particular policeman that i was with as to why these children were shot, because it is alleged that they were going inside a bar.  Why did he not arrest them and put them in custody rather than killing them.  His response was that he did not want to discuss that matter with me, because these children were sent by us as the parents to go and wreck havoc and I came back home.\n When I got home his mother was already present and whilst we were sitting there some policemen came into the house.  They started assaulting all the people who were there especially the youth asking them as to what they wanted and they started kicking the others who were there as well as the mother.  The mother was sitting on top of the mattress as a sign of mourning.  Ever since then we never saw each other, but she was quite disturbed by the incident and I think she was mentally disturbed after her son had died.  Up till today I am not staying with her and we buried the boy.  That is all I can say about the incident.",

I think you yourself through your own experiences, through your own pain you have actually put your finger on it completely when you said that we asked the question why were these people not arrested, what was the need to go and shoot them.  This is a story, it is of no consolation to you, but it is a story that we have heard many, many times of a confrontation between the police, the local police and the youth where police open fire and children are killed.  Where they are, yes they are protesting, yes they have grievances, but in the protest they get killed.  I think that, as you have said, this is something that is senseless, it is something without reason and it is certainly something that we, as a Commission, will try and recommend, because what we are trying to do through this process is to ensure that we do not have the same type of culture where this sort of thing is not only possible, but it is actually fairly regular.  It is, we are moving towards a country, a culture which is completely different and where children do not get killed so senselessly.  So we would like to thank you very much for coming.  Thank you.",
