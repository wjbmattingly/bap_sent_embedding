            "It was on the 8th of September 1976, on that day - as in the days prior to that - there was unrest in the aria Cloetesville where we lived in Stellenbosch.  \nAt that stage approximately a week prior to that we have moved to a new home and as a result of that the house we had occupied previously was unoccupied and we used to keep a watchful eye on that house.  And as usual my brother and I would go and check on the old house and walk up to our new house because we used to have supper at 6 o'clock and no later.  \nOn this particular day, as I said there was a lot of unrest in the area - periodic unrest in the area -  and I remember a specific incident that day - I'm merely mentioning it because it influenced my line of thought.  And I remember a policemen in camouflage who kept hitting a 4-to-5-year-old  with shambocks so much so that she wet herself.  And just before that another man in the community, Mr Kammies, was shot dead by the Riot Police.  \nSeron, as we knew him, had come from work that evening and I waited for him at our old house and we walked up together.  The police shot and I said to him Ron we better get away from here because these people aren't playing.  He wasn't aware of what had happened that day and I had advised him that should get out of the line of fire and we moved towards a block of flats.  \nI went into the first block of flats and he went into the next block.  And misfortune would have it, he made the wrong choice and he went into the direction of the policemen.  Accordingly I couldn't see the - according to eye witnesses, because I didn't see it myself, a certain Fuad Arnold - I saw him standing on the steps, so he had a much better view of what happened.  \nHe said Ron was in the bathroom, they shouted for him to come out whereupon he responded yes sir I'm coming out and he put his hands up in the air.  And while his hands were in the air, according to the eye witness, a certain Constable van Zyl shot him at close range with a shotgun.  And the impacted was great that his heart, longs and liver were penetrated by the bullets.\nWhen I came to the bathroom - this is the bathroom next door, when I came out of the bathroom next door - they were dragging him out like an animal.  And another policeman in camouflage shouted to me - quite a few of the other policemen were congratulating him oh that was an excellent shot and congratulations.  \nFor me it's extremely difficult to relive these events but to a certain extent one lives with feeling of guilt.  You say to yourself that if I had made the right choice, you know, then this wouldn't have happened.  And you constantly doubt your own judgment.  And you live in doubt thinking shouldn't I have gone the other way instead.  It's very difficult to judge yourself with hand sight because the matter was heard at the court in Stellenbosch.\nThe Magistrate's verdict then was that it was a very difficult situation and that no one is to blame - that the policemen acted in accordance with his duty and hence no one was to blame for the incident.        \nFor us it was a very difficult time because my father - he and my father - were breadwinners at home at that stage and just before his shooting my father was declared terminally ill due to cancer.   My father also passed away not to long thereafter and I was a student at that stage and it was probably a difficult time for all of us in South Africa and one doesn't want to sort of eventuate your own situation but it just wasn't easy. I has to sacrifice my bursary money to educate my younger brother.  \nThe most difficult part is probably that we were a big family and when my mother set the table in the evening she would sub-continuously prepare Ron's place at the table and when somebody said to her but Ron is not with us any longer she would shed these silent tears.\nAnd we always teased her very gently because we were always very fair in our community and Ron was also - always as dark as my father and we always teased her very lightheartedly about her favoring Ron, because he looked like my father.\nAnd she did not live much longer thereafter and she also passed away and fortunately I was working at the time and could take care of my younger brothers and sisters, but I don't think that my mother could handle the constant harassment and detention of my younger brothers and I don't know if it's due to a feeling of guild but we were always terrorized by the safety - the security police and they would come to our house at any part of the night and lock up any one of us at random.\nAnd in that regard we got a lot of support from the Reverent, Dr Allen Boesak, and the community at large and they kept us going and we were privileged in that the incident drew us closer together as a family.  But suppose the vacuum will always be there and I'll always ask myself did I make the right chose, shouldn't we have waited a bit longer instead, and so on.",

Unfortunately my father answered the telephone and they said they wanted to talk to him and I said it's strange why do they want to speak to my father. And my mother said she'll take the telephone and they said no they specifically want to talk to my father.  \nAnd they said  Ronny have been shot and I can't tell you how it felt at that stage.  You just suddenly feel that he had to be here now, I was so shocked.  The baby was to be born that same month, I had to take tablets, I had to take medicine.  Some times you felt I didn't want to live any more and then I thought think about this child.  \nRonny was killed on the 8th , he was buried on the 14th and on the 13th the child was born.  After the child's birth I had to leave the hospital the day right after the birth.  This child grew up with my mother and my father's assistance.  \nAlso I wanted to thank Ronny and for the brothers and some times he came from school and said why don't I have a father and the children would ask where's your father and he said no my father had been shot.  And I said one day you will understand, not now but one day.  And everybody said that he - something - all this is going to influence him a lot.  He is   slow at learning at school and - but it is important for me to keep him in the right way, but he stayed at school in he is in Std 8.",
