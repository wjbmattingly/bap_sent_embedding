            "Good morning, I welcome you the commissioners of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on behalf of the Paarl community.  We are grateful to you for the important work that you are doing and for all that are doing to promote the cause of peace and reconciliation within this country.  We believe this process is absolutely necessary in the healing of our land that had been subjected to so much that was destructive.\nWe of the Paarl community, are committed to the process for healing and peace that have been set up, but we are deeply aware of the tremendous pain, bitterness and suffering that our people have had to endure, over recent decades.  We have an historical legacy, that has negatively impinged upon us in our common life together.  It is the whole of our community that has suffered.\nOn the one hand there were those who belonged to the so-called white sector, who had inherited a complex historical process and legacy, which consisted of indelicate and unwise policies, which had led to racial separation, alienation and economic exploitation.  On the other hand there were those people who on the - who were on the wrong side of the divide, and who bore the brunt of the ill-effects of the repressive policies that have been persuade.  The legacy which we inherited as a town is one that caused  much pain and suffering, which both communities suffered.\nThe consequences of the legacy was that it engendered two political opposites who had in the process become sworn enemies.  A system was engineered, which consisted of a grotesquely lop-sided socioeconomic construct with an unjust political dispensation, undemocratically imposed on the majority of the population.  It was this failed socio-economic construct and unjust system that was vigorously perpetuated by state apparatus, that led to unrest, resistance and justifiable revolt, which after all is a long history in this country.  \nThe struggle in Paarl has various phases.  In Paarl the story of resistance in the 60's was one marked by the imposition of the passed laws and the arbitrary - arbitrary withdrawal of civil rights of ordinary citizens.  The POQU revolt has been documented, as a courageous stand by people, who had been severally wronged.  In this event many people lost their lives.  The white community suffered as well.\nA young school girl was killed in Paarl - white young girl - and a white couple who were in Mbekweni were killed.  They were accused of being informers.  This is a period of increased suppression of political expression.  The decade of the 70's is marked by a - the greater militarization of the State and the brutal enforcement of segregationist policies.\nThe Group Areas Act, further exacerbated the alienation of people from one another in our town.  Progressive religious response and all political activity were severally curtailed.  Then came the Soweto Revolt, which impacted profoundly on student activism in Paarl.  Black consciousness mobilized them, and the state responded by unleashing heavy state violence against them.\nDuring this time many students and innocent people died,  students were shot at randomly.  An innocent woman in a taxi was killed by indiscriminate shooting, a young man playing football on a football field, was killed.  Youngsters fleeing police were shot at and one or two killed.  On the other side of the - of the divide, young men were sent - young white men were sent to the border, where some also died, like Pellow Parlight, Wallace McGregor, who believe he was defending his country, but this was against fellow countrymen.  The decade of the  60's, of the 80's, I beg your - I beg your  pardon, so greater resistance mounting in Paarl.\nMobilization of the masses became more successful,  [indistinct]    The basis laid for the emergence of the United Democratic Front, also in Paarl - as in other areas.  \nA whole spectrum of community organizations, political organizations, trade unions were organized and immobilized into an effective force.  More young people were recruited in this period for the liberation forces and Umkhonto we Sizwe.\nOne cannot  adequately - adequately begin to describe the retaliatory response by the  State that was perceived by them to be the total onslaught.  The riot and security police were most effectively used to combat mass gatherings and to intimidate ordinary citizens.  People who were afraid off a knock on the door.  It could mean death or arrest, many of us were arbitrarily incarcerated under the emergency laws of 1985.  The presents of informers was rife.\nYou could trust no one.  Archers provocateurs were used to infiltrate community organizations,  churches, sports clubs, the aim being to identify anyone who is - who was regarded as a subversives.  The aim was to destabilize in line with the policy of destabilization of countries outside South Africa.\nMany ministers were hesitant to preach the truth of the gospel and preferred a quietest approach. Telephone-tapping was rife.  It was the arbitrary tear gassing of people - just ask the people of  Mbekweni about tear gassing, they will tell you. A lady was busy working in the kitchen preparing supper and somebody arbitrarily threw a tear gas canister into the house.  Old people died as result, children's lives have been wrecked - some of them for live.\nI want to ask this morning who were the person in the blue bakkie which drove through Mbekweni shooting randomly at people, innocent people sitting on a - on a stoep.  Who was it?  Who caused the death of so many people, torturing them?  Who are responsible for the death of Ronnie Robinson?\nWho are responsible for Philemon Maxam's desperate act, to go and kill on a farm, a white farmer and a servant in order to get arms to defend himself in a situation where he was defenseless.  Who was behind the persecution, the blackmail and extortion against certain people?  Some people were abducted and have disappeared mysteriously, we don't know today still where they are.\nThis accumulation of pain and hatred and suffering, inequality, injustice left a terrible blemish on the Berg River Valley.  But we here I'm sure speak for all of us although I am an inkommer - as they you when you come in from outside, I'm from Johannesburg -  we in the Valley are confident that a new future has opened for  us all.  Nelson Mandela  can never be put back in prison, never.\nAnd the processes  of change  and transformation cannot be undone.  We in the valley are hopeful of our future, there are signs of change.  Wonderful signs, and we confirm Allister Sparks and his book THE MIND OF SOUTH AFRICA. That South Africa will as of now cease to be a symbol of racism  and division.  In stead, it is bound to become a symbol instead of national  - symbol instead of national reconciliation and racial harmony.  Of co-existence between black and white, a  bridge between the  [indistinct]  of the first world and the have-not's of the third world.  This is our dream of the dawning of a new millennium.\nMay the",
