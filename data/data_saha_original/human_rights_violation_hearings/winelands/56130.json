It was just in between the hall and the Montana  Cafe, I was standing there counting my  money.  While I was counting the money people shouted\nRun, run he was going to shoot you.\nI didn't take that into regard and I just kept on counting my money, it was R1-80 - that was the last money I had.  Somebody said - it was - somebody said look around and the police started shooting and I said\nDon't shoot me.\nAnd he just shot and he kept on shooting till I fell down.\n While I was lying there I look him right into the face and he kept on shooting me.  And then eventually I left - I lost my conscience.  Later on when I regained consciousness I decided I'm going to run and try to get home.  I only got so far as 2 old woman and they assisted me and took me to Ms Fredericks' house.  Ms Zeeman took one of the people's shirts and put a bandage around the vain on my leg where I was hurt.  Afterwards I remained in her house and Ms Zeeman came there and said there was a ambulance waiting, they took me to the Community Hall where the ambulance was waiting.  \nWhere  - while we were waiting for the other people we went to Dr Nell's surgery.  We waited there for about 20 minutes and then Mr Adam Clune - McClune arrived there.  He and my mother-in-law, they were talking while the ambulance drivers were assisting the people.  Afterwards we were taken to the Eben Donges Hospital where we were treated.  2 weeks - 2 to 3 weeks afterwards we appeared in court.  \nWe told our whole story in court and later it happened that the whole court case came to a standstill and nothing happened.  Because - and then I decided I had to make a plan to go back to work.  Later I got married, my husband assisted me and the bird shot was removed from my leg and from my forehead, my arm and my leg.  He said he couldn't do anything about my hand because the bullet was lodged in a sinew.",
