And only at 11 o'clock the next morning you were able to go to him.  Is it possible that he - that he could have lived if you were able to help him directly - to take him with an ambulance to the hospital or was he killed on ...[intervention]",

I then get quite confused because at a Christian example is that one helps another person without expecting anything back. \nI then wonder what kind of example are you giving us that you - you do such  a good deed and then you want to be paid back for that deed.  But we thank you for that because these are difficult times.  It goes to show that life is tough, Ubunto?? from the heart is no longer there.\nYou do a good deed only to be paid back, it shows that life is tough for our people.  I criticize you but constructively sir, the Commission is not - unfortunately - is not here to pay back for the good deeds that people did a while back.  The pains of the people that were victims and their losses after the - the previous unrest.  The Commission therefore will endeavor to help Malusi's mother.  It will not be able to help you - to pay you back for the good deeds towards Malusi's mother, but  we do thank you sir.
