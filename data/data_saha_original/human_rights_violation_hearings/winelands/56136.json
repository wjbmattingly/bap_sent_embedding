Mr Viljoen can you hear me threw the headphones, okay.\n We have some technical problems, I believe the vegetation blocks out the signals from - from the equipment so that's what's causing the problems. \n Mr Viljoen thank you very much for coming here today.  You are also going to tell us about an incident which affected you and your family in 1976 and you're going to tell us about the day on which your wife was shot.  So I'd  like you to first tell us a little bit about your family, then tell us what was happening in Paarl in 1976 and tell us your story.",

            "On this particular day I was ill in bed with a stomach problem. I was working at the post office but that particular day I was at home.  My wife had been working at the police station  in Paarl for years and years.  She was the main chef there and on this day of this incident they brought her home in a police vehicle and I was laying there and she served me my food. \nAnd my daughter in law then came and she came to inform my wife that my oldest son, that was her husband, had just been detained.  She was so upset about that, that the two of them left immediately, not to where the police were - it was far from where the police were.  The reason for that was that she wanted to find out why they had arrested him.  She wanted to go to the police station.  \nOn the way there they met up with a taxi driver that was standing there and I believe that that taxi driver had been warned that he should not move around in that area, picking up commuters, but he ignored that warning.  My   wife and daughter in law got into the taxi and she was sitting on the left side and my daughter in law on the right hand side.  \nAnd in front of her was another person in the taxi, a certain Mr Basson who was a bus driver.  When they got into the taxi the taxi had took of and the started shooting at the taxi.  And I could  [indistinct] that it was a powerful weapon that they had used because the bullet penetrated my wife's body and the passenger who was sitting next to the - the taxi driver the bullet lodged there so they never got to the police station because Mr Basson had to be dropped of first and when he got out he realized that his back was bleeding.\nAnd they immediately took another road and rushed of to the hospital.  On their arrival at the hospital they found that his bullet was lodged in his body.  And they removed the bullet and when they came back, they found that my wife was no longer seated in the taxi but that she was laying down and she was covered in blood.\nI was at home, unaware of anything and I lay aware all night wondering where my wife  was sheltering.  At approximately 3 am there was a knock at the door.  And I did not want to send my children to see so I went to go and peep at the door and I saw this person had a long thing in his hand which looked to me like a gun and it was not that but it was my oldest daughter's father who had come to tell me that my wife had been shot.  \nAnd I lay there with my broken heart and grieve until daybreak so we could go to the  police station to identify  the corpse.  The inquest found that her heart and longs had been shattered by the bullet - the gun that was used.  So it wasn't an ordinary rifle but what amazes me is that the same white and Coloured that she had cooked for, for years did not have the heart to come to me and say can we be of any assistance with the funeral arrangements or anything, nothing.  \nThis matter was handed to an attorney who was in America, but it never ever went to court.  It never ever became a trial, never went to trial and I had to bear the costs by myself, pay for everything and up until now nothing has happened.",

To think that they could give a R1 000.00 for somebody's life and then still you'd only get R600.00 out of that.\nIt is very difficult to fathom.  I mean anybody that listened to that story like us and many others which we have listened to.  People say that it is unbelievable, it's incredible, it could never had happened that people could just shoot others at - randomly and you would say yes, it did happen and you would hear the evidence of people coming to testify.  \nAnd you think that people still say no-no-no it's impossible, we cannot believe that.  And when you add that Ms Viljoen was working for the police - she used to cook for them - and that nobody thought of having the decency to come to you and say look something has happened and we are so sorry for what has happened.\nOne always hopes that when there are - it there are people who remember that they were part of this incident, that God will touch their souls because we do not want to talk about hatred and bearing grudges.  We are talking about peace, forgiveness and reconciliation.  And something that could touch a person and that - that person could say that I do not want to be acquitted but I would like to destroy my part or my contribution to this incident by going to apologize.\nBecause one still has to appear before God even if we as people never realized what the hole truth is, and we say to people like these that if you want to be healed spiritually, this is not about whether you were found guilty in a court of law or not, but knowing what you have done and to please come forward and come and ask for forgiveness.  \nTo ask for forgiveness and - people will see a miracle.  You will see people who are willing to forgive but we thank you for having come and we hope that God will bless you and that he will be with you.  He has blessed you and he has been with you.
