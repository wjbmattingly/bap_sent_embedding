On a Saturday and I - when I got to the place I saw a crowd of people coming, rushing towards me and I heard some gun shots and I ran away.  But unfortunately I ran towards the person who was shooting.  I got into one house having knocked, whilst knocking I couldn't see any people and I heard someone talking saying that I was one of the people who was being looking - wanted.\n Then I felt something hitting me on my back and once more another one hit me on the back - 3 times I was hit on the back.  Then I fell and collapsed, then this particular person jumped over the fence - it was a policeman and he continued to shoot me and he shot me 4 times in addition to the 3 wounds I had.

After that they quarreled and the policeman asked me - asked them to remove me and take me home.  And the owner of the house said I witnessing and I'm going to give report about all what I've seen. \n That was the last time I had - them I lost consciousness.  I heard from the hospital that I lost my mind - I don't know what happened to me.  So I was in hospital for quite some time and my mind was not functioning well.  And even when my family members used to visit me they would not be allowed to talk to me.\n They couldn't speak to me - they could not speak to me because I was in a bad state.  I was in Tygerberg Hospital under the security guard and my mother asked them why I was under police guard.  They said it's because I had attempted to burn a house that belonged to the policeman.  And my mother used to be very angry about this.\n So they asked my mother to wait for me to recover, so I kept in hospital for a while and one day policemen came to the hospital.  They were coming from Paarl and they took me from Tygerberg, despite that the doctor who was in charge objected to all this.  Because I was still in a bad condition, then these policemen said they wanted me but they told lies to the doctor which means that they had intention that I was going to die on my way.  \n So we used a road that was unknown to me, we drove trough farms and these policemen who are in the front of the van were laughing at me.  And I still had stitches on my operation so they took me to a Police Station.  I then made a request that they should inform my family but they told me that my family knew that I was there.\n At night I complained that I was in pain, I wanted to go back to hospital and they said they would see.  Then the head of the Police Station asked them not to keep me there longer because he was going to be held responsible.  So I was removed in an ambulance and taken back to Tygerberg Hospital.\n And all the time I was under police guard and whenever I would want to go to the toilet I would not be allowed to.  I then asked that they should give me some crutches and then the doctors told me that it wasn't time yet.  So I had to move on a wheelchair and some other times the police would come again and take me to the Police Station.  And my mother was not aware of all this up and down and ultimately they got a lawyer that was organized by the UDF and this lawyer asked that I should be sent back to the Tygerberg Hospital and to the General Hospital as well.\n So according to my records it showed that I was in hospital for 21 days and one other time they discovered that I had 2 bullets that were imbedded in my spinal cord so I had to be operated on to take these bullets out.  But my left leg was giving trouble, I could not walk properly and them my mother - they wanted to amputate my leg but I said I didn't want them to.",

When I asked my mother to make a follow up, my mother refused because she said they were fooling around so we just left everything like that.\n As I am growing up some people are asking me to pursue the matter.  I did go to that lawyer and that lawyer said he did not succeed and yet he spent a lot of his money because the people who had instituted the claim just left everything behind.

I then got to hear that there was some children who had been shot at V section and I felt unhappy.  \nThen in the afternoon I went to my sister's place to find out about Andile and my sister told me that Andile had not reached her place.  And so I told her that I had sent Andile to her place.  Then I was shown where these  children had been shot, then other children informed me that there was one child who had been shot and his name Andela but the person who knew best about this was Ms Lando and there were police that were taking guard.\nSo I went to Mr Lando's place past Ngewu's family and I asked for their on with the name Andile and they also told me about their confusion they had about this name but referred me to Mr Lando's place.  And I went there and I found his wife and he said he had seen the person who had been shot at section L and he described the person.  Then I said that is my son, then I asked him what he had done, then he said he had telephoned for the ambulance.\n So I went back to my sister but my sister said the person who had been shot was not my Andile because the person he had seen was not there - my son.  So I went back to my house and I didn't say anything to my mother but talked to my brother and Andile's father.  As we were walking up the white people were throwing tear gas and I was crying.  So Andile's father came late in the day and I was intending to get to the Tygerberg Hospital.  I decided to go to Tygerberg Hospital but they had given a wrong name.  \nThen I decided to go and look at the person, I went into the ward and I saw that there was a policeman that was on guard.  And I asked this policeman whether he was still alive.  There were some breathing devises that he was using so the doctor asked me not to talk to him because he was in a bad state and I was crying but the doctor asked me to leave and go home.  \nIn the morning I went to the advise office and - to give them a report that I had seen Andile.  I went to the Police Station and I asked for the head of the police and the Investigating Officer and I was told that it was - it was Willemse but there was not case as yet.  So I met Willemse and he told me that he was busy so I kept on visiting my son in Tygerberg.  So one Saturday I went to the hospital and I was told that Andile had been discharged - in fact he had been taken away by the police from Paarl.\nAnd queried why they could do that because he still had this bullet on his back.  Than I got onto a train and went to the Police Station where I found 2 ladies and - who said to me that there was no hope that my son was going to leave.  And they had - Andile had asked these 2 ladies to tell me that he was in pain.  So I asked the police to allow me to see my son but they refused.  Then I talked to Randindi to take the food to Andile, then he asked me to take the fruit away but took the other food. \nOn my way home I heard some people calling from the cells and they told me that Andile was in a very bad state.  He couldn't do anything for himself - they were washing him and they asked me to do something.  So on Monday morning I went to see Mr Willemse at the Police Station, so Randindi went to look for Mr Willemse and I went up to the 3rd floor to meet him.  And I asked him whether he wanted that my son should die - should die.\nThen he said my son should tell them the truth, who had sent them to go and burn the house.  Then I told them that my son knew nothing about that - I sent him to my sister's house.  Then I warned him that I was going to send them to court and them he said to me I should go away and they were going to take my son back to Tygerberg.\nSo when I phoned Tygerberg I was told that Andile was back there, Andile was in hospital and them early in the morning at 5 o'clock some policemen came to our house asking for Nogene and my mother came to me and showed them into my room and they asked me - they said they wanted to talk to me.  And I didn't want to come out.  There were a lot of these white policemen but Willemse was not amongst them.\nI refused to go with them, and my brother insisted that they should talk there at home so they left me.  The following day they came back and they asked for my ID book and they asked for my name but I told them that my name is not Gene and that name does not appear on my ID book.  But one of them said this is the person we are looking for.  So I put on a coat and shoes and got into their van, they drove round the location until we got to the Police Station at about 7 o'clock in the morning.  These white persons would be coming to me asking me why I was sitting there.   \nI would tell them I was told to sit there, after a long time April Thladi with Willemse came stood at the door and looked at me and they called me.  We went up to the upper floors of the Police Station and they asked me about Marchels, I told them I knew nothing about Marchels.  They asked me about my children, then I said I knew nothing about my - the activities of my children.  \nSo they wanted a lot of information about what was happening in the location, about my children's activities.  Then they said they were going to send me to Pollsmoor, then they took me to Pollsmoor and kept me there for 3 months but after some time I was released. And Andile too was released, there - Andile was accused of burning a house and then there was a lawyer representing him.  \nAnd so Andile was released, so a certain man from Cape Town  [indistinct] came to explain to me that the State was saying that Thladi was off duty at the time.  So I wanted to find out why he had used a gun when he was off duty.",
