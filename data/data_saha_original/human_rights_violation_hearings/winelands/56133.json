            "On that specific day I was coming from work, I came to home that evening about 7   o'clock.  He brought his girlfriend with and he said  \nFather, please give me some money, I would to bioscope.\nI had money but I said\nNo I don't have any money for you, because you see how the boers are shooting, they going to shoot you and when you come from bioscope tonight, at that time they going to hurt your.\nI said\nAll I could do is that tomorrow you need some shoes, go and buy some - two pairs of shoes tomorrow.  I don't want you to get hurt.\nAnd he said\nYes, father then I'll rather take her home.\nAnd he took her to Amstel Hof in Paarl East.  He took her away to her house and coming back the unrest was already - already there in Klein Drakenstein Street.  His friends accompanied him, when he came to Fisher's house, they said no they at Klein Drakenstein Street.  \nHe always told me, I can't participate in these things, but if they catch me, they're going suspend me at the University.   And therefore I had confidence in my child, we all loved one another in this house and we always shared - when I bought something for the one, I bought the same for the others.  I had another 2 sons and a daughter.  \nThat night I asked my wife - it was about past 10 that evening - and I asked when was he coming home and she said no if he did not come home, he was going to  sleep with Godfrey Hendricks.  If it was to late he usually slept there, I accepted that because a mother knows her children.  \nThat morning I got up, she had already left for work.  When I left the house, I heard the telephone and somebody said\nAlex is that you.\nAnd a voice said\nYour son was killed last night, he was shot dead.\nI was so shocked because I know he had taken his girlfriend home.  Then I left the house and I walked.  I put the telephone down and I went to Fisher's house.  When I came - when I left my house I saw all the people watching me and it was strange why were all these people looking at me.  \nWhat had I done, when I came to Fisher's house Anthony was crying and he said Uncle Alex they killed him last night, they shot him dead.   I knew we are all coloured people, I didn't believe it, I wanted to see it myself.  And he said take me there and show me.\nHaving arrived there I saw the blood and I realized what had happened.  And I said I was going to the police station. On my way to the police station, all the people were standing outside the police station and I asked who had shot my child.  It was Boy Reed and Goldy Simon, Appolis and other policemen whom I knew because they all belonged to my church.  And they said the boers had killed your child,  Mr Faas.\nI couldn't do  anything because I believed what they said,  I went home.  Afterwards I went  to my - where my wife worked and I told her.  I went back to the mortuary and they asked is that your child and I said they couldn't show me anything, I must come back the next day.\nThe next day I returned there, I took 1 day off and I took one of his friends as a witness - one of his University friends.  Having arrived at the morgue with my wife, there was a - Peter's was also there and all the policeman are not bad - some of them are really well behaved.  They accepted us - or received us in a friendly way and they chatted to us and they put us at ease.  \nAfter we've had our tea  we were not so tense anymore and we settled down, then they told me what had happened to my son.  I felt very, very sad but what frustrated me even more, was that all the white policemen were standing outside and  they were showing me their fists.  And this was very terrible because my child had already been killed.  What did they want from me?  And this atmosphere was not very good - not very friendly and then I said I wanted to go out and arrange for my child's funeral.  \nOutside I asked them what caused my child's death because the other pathologist said that he was bending down - the tried to pick up a stone and that caused his death and somebody said no he did not bend to pick up a stone because then he would still be alive.  Because then the shot would have not hit him at the back of his neck, on the left side - the shotgun hit him and he fell down dead.\nThis was - I  felt very sorry about this but as we were walking away, two white policemen came there and I asked them\nPlease sir, who had shot my child?\nAnd the one Constable said\nI am Captain Coetzee and this is Lieutenant Oosthuizen.\nWhat broke my heart is that I never could think that white people will also belong to a church - that they could behave like that and this Oosthuizen took his finger and pointed on his chest and said\nI killed your child\nAnd my heart dropped into my shoes.  I felt so sad, I was at a lost for words and he said\nYou - you must go and ask your friends what he did, he carried the drum with the fire in it and he was wearing a white sweater and that is why I had shot him.\nAnd this man with him said\nYou had shot a wrong man, you did not shoot the one with the white sweater, you shot the other one.\nAnd Captain Coetzee said\nLet's rather go.\nWhen we came inside, Colonel Peters asked me when will the funeral be.  I can't say because I waiting for people from Bloemfontein.  \nInside a Captain Daniels was sitting at a desk.  He was a very pompous man.  He was sitting there, the doors were open and all the policemen was standing there to listen to what we were saying.  What was really shocking is that this coloured detective stood up and he put his shirt into his trousers and said\nAlex, is Adri Faas your child, I could not think that you could afford a child to attend University.\nThose were his precise words, I sat quietly and I thought that man - this man does not have a skin, this man does not think anything about anybody else - he's a nothing.  And Peters kept quiet and after 2 minutes he said\nCaptain Daniels rather read this rule because you should not be here and when you leave close the door behind you.\nHe left, he closed the door and after that we held our conversation.  I appreciate what Peters did for me.  He always encouraged me and he told me that I appreciate what you said, nobody would have behaved like you would have done.  I told you when the funeral would be held and he said that he will arrange everything.  When I came home, I arranged the funeral for that Tuesday.\nI told the minister that I am going to hold the funeral on the Saturday and the minister said\nDon't worry.\nHe himself will organize my child's funeral.  I didn't answer him at all because never in my life I have noticed that a minister could arrange a funeral.  \nHalf past 10 that morning, when he arrived at my house he said that the funeral will go down Langtana Street, Paulus Street, Klein Drakenstein Street, passed the police station and then to the hall and then right down Van der Stell Street and then back into Langenhoven Street and the we will go to the grave yard.\nAnd I asked\nYou are my minister and today I'm telling you\nand I left him standing outside\nand today I'm telling you, you've sold me out to the boers.\nAnd I said\nHow can you say that?\nAnd you said\nI'm a member of this church.\nBecause I was a member of the church in Joubert's time.  A coloured's funeral had never gone threw a white area.  Strauss arranged the funeral I Klein Drakenstein and he said why you and he says\nNow I understand your circumstances, you should be on the relationship community.  You are part of the NP conspiracy.\nAnd I said\nI'm not going to attend the funeral.  Tell him I'm going to arrange the funeral myself.\nAnd on that Wednesday I met him and Peter said if you want to talk to me about the funeral, I have a house you can come to my house.  After 15 minutes he came back and we spoke and I told him everything, how it is - it was from Paarl  - and why I did not want to go down Langenhoven Street because there was a farm house and next to that there were guava orchid and near that most of the policemen and detectives lived.\nAnd also the commanding officer lived there and he was actually  their  [indistinct] because I painted that church, I know him, I great him in the mornings.  I say\nGood morning Reverent.\nAnd he would not great you back, neither will his wife, neither will his children.  And I knew that they were going to shoot more children there - more children and I said I am not going because my child is dead, I made peace with that, but I do not want other people's children to be shot and then the following day my referent - my priest is going to tell me that he did not lead the funeral.\nAnd later Commander Peters phoned me and said there - there  was board that said the Bergram Group and that evening he said - he came to me and he said arrange the funeral the way you want to and I did that and I can just thank God for it because I can say nobody can speak - can feel your pain for you.  It's your pain, it's child - it's your child and it's your pain.  \nAnd what was so ironic is that when we left  END OF TAPE 3, SIDE A...the whole road was full, right up until Van Riebeeck Street and the children were all following the precession - funeral precession and the hearse was stopped before this plankies school and Captain Coetzee was there and Oosthuizen and so many white policemen, but not one coloured policeman was present.  But at the shooting incident there were coloured policemen and they all gave statements but when we got to town they weren't acceptable anymore.  They had to stay out, they were - they were refused entry, but when - when they came to kill our children, the coloured policemen were present.  That's why I say thereafter many of them were promoted - many of them were promoted after my child's death.  \nThey were on it but I am just happy - I'm - I'm at peace because when the hearse stopped, they started shooting at 6-, 7- and 8-year-old kids and I got out of the vehicle in which I was in and I went to stand in front of the hearse and said to him\nShoot me, I am at peace with this whole thing.\nBecause by then I was bitter.",

            "It was heartbreaking for me to think that the NG Mother Church could cast us as the NG Daughter Church.  The Dutch Reformed Church could cast us aside like dogs, even their priests they are as guilty for their prejudice and one day I got a tape for Allen Boesak when  he was in Belhar.  \n I played this tape and his message was that God's word is not bound, and that's where I realized out of that message that the priests had misled us.  They had misled us to their advantage and I would like to say to you today, I am a member of the Dutch Reformed Church but I would like to say thank you to the ANC, I would like to say thank you to Reverent Maart.  Those people supported me far more than my own church.  As a missionary I would like to say it in all honesty, the Dutch Reformed Church's people I don't even know if they know that God exist to them, God is but a word.\n They cannot say that they've excepted God, because it is but the word of God that can - that can free you.  God's work can set you free and I would like to say today that my child's death was a loss to me.  Thanks to that my whole home has suffered because it was a loss to me, I even lost in court.  My wife and I have been divorced since - as a result.  When we appeared in court Rossouw the magistrate said\nWhat do you want here, you husband and wife, go out.\nAnd the advocate said to him\nThese are the deceased's parents.\nAnd I've never seen a court like that, that's where we were sitting, that's where the magistrate was sitting.  All these policemen were sitting between us  and they gave conflicting versions of what happened and they'd be laughing.  How would I - how was I suppose to feel as a parent and that led to the breakup of my home.  But I thank God I have since excepted God in my life because I realized that when you except God you have to fix your things with God first, you have to fix your relationship with God first.  Because without building a relationship with God you cannot do that with - with - with your fellow human beings. \nI've forgiven them because I do not want their children or the community should point a finger at their children in the future and say they did that.  They are children, God wants us to come together and it is my feeling that I do not want to bear grudges and I want reconciliation but reconciliation is only possible threw God.  Only then can reconciliation with our brothers and sisters be possible.  And I trust that  God - we don't know - will make it possible for us to hold hand with each other that we know and we see.  Because he is a just God, he is after 11 years God has placed you here to come and wipe our tears so that we can know that this is our souls  and this is where we can come and tell our stories.  \nSo that when we leave here we can say truly there is God and I would like to say I have a son that left school in 1987.  He tried to apply  to be a prison warden, a policeman, they would not except him - a traffic warden.  He  is independent - he as my daughter, she is a matriculant.  I retired out of the building trade last year as a painter, I receive a mere R460.00 per month and I have got to support my children.  And until - when God blesses me with a few odd jobs, I get a bit of an extra income.  \nBut what will happen to my children, who is going to care for them.  And that's why I would like to ask the Honorable Commission, I have done a lot in live but I'm not - I don't care about myself.  I know that I have settled my matters with God - because when one settles matters with God he says that we have to share with each other and I am sharing my feelings with you now and also with the community.  So that they can understand how bitter my wife and my children and myself were and what the cause was because if my  child had lived today, he might have had his own practice and he would have been able to help them to.  \nBut God has always been good to us and we trust that he will take care of their needs and that there will be compensation and this is my wish - my wish is that God will carry us threw to the times that lay ahead that we don't know about.  So that we as a community will reach out to each other and insure that something like this never happens again, that we will hold each other by the hand cause you are here today to make it possible that there should be reconciliation and that we will hold each other by the hand and march forward together towards the path of reconciliation.",

There was an inquest at the Paarl Magistrates Court to - with regards to the death - this death which was held on the 17th of February 1986 with residing officer Magistrate JHA Rossouw.  \nAnd according to the  medical record the - your son's death was caused by brain damage due to the shooting incident and there are three - there were three bullet wounds on his body - found on his body.  There was a bullet wound behind his left ear which penetrated his brain, there was a bullet wound to his left shoulder which penetrated the mussel tissue and there were two shooting - two bullet wounds to his right arm.  \nAnd this indicated that all these shot were fired from behind and  that this Lieutenant Colonel Oosthuizen acknowledged that he had fired the shot with a - a - his own personal  shotgun and this shotgun was a weapon known as a SSG.  It wasn't bird shot, it was buck shot  these were big bullets that he had used.  They were SSG bullets which were much bigger than usual and the evidence that was given by the persons who were with him that evening - his friends.  \nHis one University friend was with him and that was Godfrey Hendricks and Isaac Fisher and also Precilla Jacobs and all of them  submitted statements to the effect that your son was not involved in any stone throwing or riotous incident but he was sitting looking at a drum which was burning in the road and that the evidence heard from amongst others the Lieutenant  who acknowledged that your son had run away when we wanted to shoot and that the eventual finding of the court on the 19th of February - two days after the - the matter was heard in February  [indistinct] was to the effect that no one was - could be held responsible for the death of your son and that there was no - there was no offense - there was no criminal offense and no one could be charged as such, is that so?",

And I could see that the passenger Lieutenant Colonel Oosthuizen was - Lieutenant  Colonel and I don't know who the passenger was.  And he took out a shotgun which did not look anything like the police issue and his words were\nYou people take to long, I am going to shoot a hot-not tonight.  \nThereafter they left and I think approximately 3 minutes later - 3 minutes at the most the distance - from the distance where the police station was and where the diseased was laying it was approximately 300 meters and I heard them asking Wessels to come there and I went out of curiosity to see what was happening there.  And Sergeant   Ross was my vehicle driver and when we got to the scene somebody shouted cause\nJust fuck off from here.\nAnd they said we should leave and we just made a U-turn at Steenkamp's Vleis which was approximately 10 meters from here.  I said he must please stop, I just want to see something and we then went back to the office and I said to them I am withdrawing from service now and I told my people they could go home as well.",
