I think you remind us and we often forget that today, whilst we sit enjoying the fruits of the democracy that a lot of women didn't survive and didn't make it and didn't live to enjoy what we now have.   And we need to thank God for every day that we are still alive, but we also need to remember that the struggle of women is not yet over.   That legislation is in place which makes it possible for women to do better, but that men often fight against women becoming more powerful, and that we must remember that that struggle still goes on.   And we also need to make a special effort to remember the contributions of those women who made it possible for us to see days like today come to fruition.  We thank you for setting that in place so that other women may tell their stories today.  Thank you for sharing that with us.  ",

And the other kids who aren't members of the family.  I am staying at home and I am not working.   I couldn't work all along, because I wasn't allowed to.   Even I tried to take myself to school, but I couldn't and this other kids who are my siblings, I was the one who was supposed to maintain them.   In this past years, I was staying with my mother.   She was a Christian and she didn't know that we were comrades.   One window at the back we removed the burglar guard, after my mother had gone to sleep, we used to remove that burglar guard and went out and she'll think we are still asleep.   One day policemen came at home.  When they arrived there they found that we were not there and my mother realised that we were not at home, and police asked my mother where we were and she didn't know truly and they took my mother with them.   When we came home the next day, we asked our neighbour and the neighbour told us that we mustn't go to our house because police were all over the place the whole night.   During the day my mother came.   I waited there until 5 o'clock and I went inside the house.   I asked my mum, \"Mum, what's going on?\" and my mother didn't want to talk to me.  She asked for painkillers.   I left to look for the tablets and later on when I came back she told me police came and they took her and they wanted her and she tried to find out from me what was going on.   I couldn't explain this thing to my mother that I am a UDF member.  And her age, she was too old at that time, it wasn't easy for me to explain everything to my mother.  Later on, I saw one man and I knew this man, he was a SB.   I took a child and then I escaped through that window.   Later, police got hold of me, they arrested me. They took me to Hilton and they locked me there.   They didn't take me to court.   I wasn't asked whether I know why I was arrested or not.   They were harassing me.  They used to use a wet towel to hit me.   They used to take me and put me through the window and make me scared and tell me that they were going to drop me down.   Some things I used to know them, letters, meetings, but I didn't say I knew them to the police.   Later on, because I was locked alone, I couldn't speak to anyone, I was confused.   I was interrogated.  They released me.  I found things were not okay at home.  They were looking for my brother, who escaped, up until today we don't know where he went to.   Some of my sibling went to Hammarsdale, and this other one they followed him to Hammarsdale and they shot him, and he survived.   After he was shot, I looked for a place for him to stay.   We went to the rural areas and I put him there, just to hide him there.   I used to send things for him.  Later my mother was taken by police, harassed all the time, and later then she got a heart attack, heart disease, high blood pressure.   And she couldn't get pension.   And later on she died.   In hospital they took time to give her medical attention.   When she died clots were coming from her nose and from her mouth.   I went back home.   Police came.  It was on Wednesday.   They told me I couldn't wait to - for the funeral, we must bury and it mustn't be a big funeral.  It was not easy for me to arrange that.   People came.   Some were from exile, and they came.  I don't know how they came there.   At the night vigil it wasn't good, police were all over.   On Saturday - the body came on Friday and it was a night vigil and the funeral was going to be on Saturday.  The programme was changed and the reverend told me he is only going to do the service at 10 o'clock and we didn't do anything in church.   We were sent to the cemetery.  And while we were there, people came, a lot of people.  I didn't know where they were coming from, but some of them were Inkatha members, and then now people were fighting.  My aim was to make sure that the coffin was going down and people were talking and then I removed the blanket on me, I threw it away.   And I was talking to Thembinkosi and people were shooting each other, fighting.  After we finished - by the time we finished people were injured, and my relatives were not there.   It was just me who was supposed to see what to do.   We went back home and that's where I realised that my mother died because of me, and this was the last time I saw my family. I stayed alone from 1986 up until today.",

I didn't know that she was going to do that, because she was my friend.   I left.   When I was at the market I saw a bus which was leaving for King Edward and I said, oh I am so late because the doctor said I must arrive at the hospital early in the morning, so that they can give me the treatment.   And then one guy came, who was wearing smart, and said to me, \"I will help you, I am the administrator of King Edward, come, I will give you a ride\".   I went inside his car.   And while I was in there, my eyes were closed, blindfold.  I didn't know what was going on.   And then I asked them, \"Please, just let me make a call calling home\".    When you asked to make a call, was this at Umlazi?   ---   No, Umlazi it's my other home.   I don't know where it was where I made a call, because they had my eyes blindfolded.   I told my aunt that, \"Aunty, they've abducted me\".   And my aunt asked, \"Who?\", and then they took the phone and hang up.   When I opened my eyes, I was inside a house B from Makhendeni(?).   That's where they raped me.   What is worse is that I was only 16 years, and I was still a virgin, and I had told myself that I wanted to be like my mother.   I used to admire my mother because she only went out with one man, that is my father, and I tried to save my virginity and this is what happened to me.   They raped me, the three guys.   That was the end of my story.   I got pregnant there.   And when I came back home, I was pregnant and now I have a child whom I don't know his father.   There was a certain girl whom I found in that house and she was also abducted, she said she was from Richmond Farm.   They used to come and rape us, both of us, and they will take us to a forest and in that area there were a lot of bodies, dead bodies.  And they used to tell us that this is what we will become.

I do think that from what you have you said we are going to have to ask that some kind of counselling be given you, because the sight of your son is a reminder of the ugly deed that was done to you.

            "  Okay, my name is Marie Odendaal Magwaza, I am a South African citizen, born on the 4th of April 1951.   And I married a fellow South African, Humphrey Pagado Pax Magwaza in March 1990.   We have three children:  Delane, who is 15, he is my husband's first child;  Maboya is 10;  and Nsikilelo is 6.  My parents were Johan Frederick Odendaal, born in 1913 and Dorothy Lorraine Odendaal, and they are cousins, born in 1920.   My parents married in 1945, across a social divide between Afrikaans and English speaking white South Africans.   And my father was a policeman in the South African Police Force and my mother a teacher.  My father also served several terms as an elder of the Dutch Reformed Church in Richmond, so we grew up in a home where we spoke mostly Afrikaans, although us children went to school in the English medium of the Richmond Primary School.   I am the third of four children.  I have two older brothers:  Willem, who was murdered in 1989;  and Pieter;  and a younger sister, Francis.  I would like to give a little bit of background to try and make sense of my submission and to explain the basis on which I am making the submission, because I realise fully that it is black people in South Africa and especially African people who have borne the brunt of gross human rights abuse under the system of apartheid and racial capitalism.   And I realise, and that is reinforced by the stories I have heard this morning that there are millions of people who have suffered much worse treatment than I have at the hands of security forces, the police, and the agents of the system.   And that made me to really hesitate whether my story was appropriate in terms of the commission's terms of reference about gross violation of human rights.   I also felt afraid to tell the story because it will be digging into old wounds.  My own and my family's especially.   But my friends have encouraged me and also I believe that the TRC's records would - they would not be complete somehow if they did not also reflect the ways in which the whole apartheid system created havoc in the lives of ordinary white people as well though people who were supposed to be benefitting from this system of power and privilege.   And it is because I had struggled to make sense of my own experiences that I thought that maybe it is important to try and say these things publicly.   And I would like to say that I am not telling this story to lay blame on anyone or to accuse anyone, because I think all the people  that I will speak about, we were all victims of the system in some way.   I think whites in particular, myself included, we were really overwhelmingly encouraged by the social system to see other people, and especially black people as being inferior to ourselves, less than human and to the extent that we were sucked into the system, perhaps in part through not being exposed to different values.  We became alienated within ourselves and alienated from our fellow human beings.   And that's a very painful condition for human beings, especial if those other people that you are alienated from are your own family.   I am not trying to say that I think white people had no choices, and that they were just totally determined by the apartheid system, but I am trying to understand how a system can take a family who loved it each and that they can be torn apart as a result of that system.   And when I was young, I was the apple of my father's eye.   But we were so torn apart that we could not reconcile before he died.   And recently I have reflected on the fact that when the Nationalist Government came to power and became to legislate apartheid, just after the Second World War, my father had recently returned from Italy, where he had been a prison of war.   When I see the trauma that my husband went through as a result of his experiences of being in the MK and being in the war in KwaZulu-Natal, then I think my father also went through that kind of trauma in wartime, and he didn't want to talk about the war.  I think for him and for many others, this must have created a climate in this country where there was very deep personal and social instability and that made really fertile ground for apartheid ideology to take root in people's minds.   So, I grew in a social system in which apartheid was just ingrained in the fabric of our every day lives, at home, in the relations with the servants, in the use of language at home, in the village.   My mother didn't like to rub shoulders with African farm workers in the streets.   And I was like a fish in water, I couldn't recognise that water that I was swimming in.   I was living in a small country village, I attended Dutch Reformed Church and Sunday School services.  My father worked in the police force.  He had control over African labourers on his farm.  I didn't really know what apartheid was all about, I just lived it, experienced it.  I didn't like the harsh treatment of servants.   I would hear the siren at night, it was sa curfew for African people, but I didn't understand what that meant.   And I also remember things like if we were travelling from Pietermaritzburg back to Richmond, sometimes little black children would be standing by the side of the road with little bowls of blackberries, bramble berries that they have picked, that they wanted to sell people, and my father would stop the car and they would come running because they thought that we wanted to buy those blackberries, and my brothers and my father encouraging them, they would jump out of the car and chase those little children, and those little children would just run and the blackberries would go flying.  And it was when I asked my father, \"Why are you doing that?\", he said, \"No, they are breaking the law and they are danger to the traffic\".   But it was like a sport, and I hated that thing.   So, that is just a little illustration of the kind of experiences that I grew up with.   And my school education gave me no critic of apartheid.  I still remember when Dr Verwoerd was assassinated, I was in about Standard Seven or Eight, and I have a diary recording in which I wrote how sad I was, what a loss it was to our nation that this gentleman, because I can see his photograph, colour photograph in the newspaper with his blue eyes smiling, he was like the father of South Africa, and that what a loss it was that he had been killed.  I think my English teacher tried to signal some how that this was not really the real picture, but she was not allowed to discuss politics and so still I did not have a clear picture.  It was only later student politics and when I was studying at university that I began to be exposed to information about apartheid that enabled me to begin to see the system for what it was.   And I think I am very grateful to those students who did have the courage to stand up and oppose apartheid at that time.  I also went on overseas travel on an American Field Service Scholarship, and that helped me to begin to develop a different perspective from the other members of my family, who did not have these same opportunities.   I remember before I went there was a dominee from the Dutch Reformed Church who came to visit me and he took me out to tea and I think maybe he was a member of the Broederbond, but he tried to persuade me not to go to America because it was not going to be in the interest of the country.   But, you know, to my credit I think - to their credit, my parents encouraged me to go, although I knew they had misgivings about it, and later my mother said, yes, she should not have allowed me to go because I had changed so much when I came back.   When I was elected on to the university SRC, in 1972, I was visited very soon after that at home in Richmond by an agent who tried to recruit me as an informer for BOSS, the bureau for State Security that was operating at that time.   I think again it was to his credit, my mother would not leave me alone with that man, he sat in the lounge with us, and then he said to the man, \"But, tell me now, you say you are working for BOSS and you show me your card, and you want my daughter to work for you to be an informer, but can you be sure that she is not already working for the security branch?\", because at that time BOSS and the security branch were not having good cooperation and he said, well no, he can't be sure about that.   So, my father said, \"Then I don't think you can try to recruit my daughter to work for you\", and at the time I didn't appreciate his strategy because I didn't want in any sense to have it implied that I would be working for security branch or BOSS or anybody else.  But I can see now it was quite a clever strategy and it was to my father's credit because he did not want me to be sucked into that system.",

            "  Thank you.  So, after that even though I was not very politically active in a direct way, my contributions were more through education through offering teaching in night schools in Edendale and through working in voluntary organisations to build a clinic at Msinge(?) and so on.  But my political views began to be a source of division between myself and my parents and my brothers and sister.  If I offered a different viewpoint or I challenged people's racist attitudes at home, then I was the one who was in the wrong, I was rocking the boat.   Why didn't I just keep quiet instead of causing conflict at home?  After that I started teaching in Greytown and I recall some minor harassment, probably it was the security branch.   Friends and I were seen as lefties on that staff and there were Broederbond members on the staff, I realised later.  So, at night, unknown people would come and throw stones on the roof of the farmhouse where we lived.   And one day they tampered with the engine of my car, so that I couldn't start my car.   I remember, I got a speeding fine after that.   Well, in 1978 they then legislated a national register of teachers, which white teachers were supposed to sign on to and I decided not to sign up, because I believed that we should have just one single education system in the country, we should not be divided in that way.   And I saw the register as being a way of exercising political control over teachers.   So, at the end of 1978, I resigned.   I taught for a year without signing, then I resigned, and I went overseas.  And I was overseas for about four and a half years and that was really the first time that I saw film footage of what happened to young people in the Soweto Uprisings of 1976, and it was really terrible.   It was very shocking and very disturbing.   So, after I had come back to South Africa in 1983, that was when I met my husband.   I did not want to go back into the education system, so I started doing freelance acting in Durban, and ironically we were both cast in the play Romeo and Juliet.  It was a matric set book at that time.   The play was touring township schools and I was Juliet and he was Romeo, but we used the South African situation as a parallel for the story, and we used our own names as well.   And everywhere we went, the school students just used to wait for that moment when a black Romeo kisses a white Juliet, because this was still forbidden fruit.   Pax and I used to talk a lot and he told me about what was happening in his township, and then he took me into Lamontville and that was when I discovered what it was like for township people to be living in a state of siege and war, with army and police vehicles on every corner, roadblocks and vehicle searches.   On more than one occasion my car was searched and I was often subjected to the soldier's attentions, they would either assume that I was not safe in the company of a black man, or else I was there for suspicious reasons.   Lamontville was in chaos and we heard something about that this morning.   The beerhall and the houses of the councillors who were hated for being corrupt were just burnt out, they were black shells.   I was really horrified by the stories Pax was telling me about suspected informers being attacked and killed by township people, and again township people just being shot at randomly on the streets at night by the police and the army.   It was like a nightmare in that time.  It was real, but it wasn't real somehow.   And I didn't know at that time that Pax, besides trying to challenge the system through drama, through the play, \"Asinamali\" that he was doing, he was also a member of the MK, but I was not aware of that.   And he was busy with underground activities all the time.   My own beliefs were in non-violence.   But around me was just violence everywhere.   And if I had known at that time I sometimes wonder whether our relationship would have persisted or not.   I didn't tell my family about my relationship with Pax.  When we became intimate, we had to be quite secretive about it, because the Immorality Act was still in force, although the State had much bigger things to worry about, so they weren't really spending a lot of time chasing people like us.  The security branch came one night and searched the communal house that we were sharing with friends.  They refused to identify themselves properly and I was very angry when they took a friend away, so I followed them in my car and they went into KwaMashu and dodged and dived in the streets and lost me.  So, I thought I am not just going to let it rest there, and I went to the police station and reported that my friend had been abducted.  And they even sent a police van out with me, but of course we didn't find anyone.   And later, fortunately, that friend was released.   Then in 1984, Pax was arrested.   At that time there was political upheaval in Lamontville, after Mzizi Dube had been assassinated.   Mzizi Dube had been leading popular resistance to corrupt councillors and rent increases in Lamontville.   These rent increases were seen as an attempt to force the residence, who had section 10 rights, to get out of Lamontville and move into Umlazi, which was controlled by KwaZulu and Inkatha.   Pax was a follower of Mzizi Dube and he was a key actor in Mbongeni Ngema's play, \"Asinamali\".   And he was largely responsible for the scripting of that play.   The play itself, he used the rent boycott slogan as its title, and it was really exposing the police brutality and the other political realities of the set up in Lamontville.   After Mzizi Dube's assassination, many people who were seen as spies in Lamontville, were attacked and some were killed.  And Pax was arrested while he was engaged in a performance of \"Asinamali\" in a church hall at the time, and it was in connection with one such an attack.   When he did not appear at the Upstairs Theatre for one of our school shows, I had to start hunting to find him, and I had to hunt a lot, because each police station they sent me to another police station.   Then he was released on bail.  And when his case came to trial, I was pregnant.  In February 1985, when I was three months pregnant, Pax was found guilty as an associate to murder.   And he was sentenced to an 8 year term of imprisonment.   He, and others, would have been defended by Mrs Victoria Mxenge, but at the last minute this support was withdrawn, there was some kind of internal thing around funding or whatever, and instead he was defended by an inexperienced pro Deo advocate.   And at that time the case was not really argued as a political case as such.   When he was convicted and sentenced, I was stunned because I had thought his chances of acquittal were reasonably good.  And it also meant that I was left on my own to face a situation without Pax' support.   And for him, the though of him to be in prison for eight years, it was like a huge void.   So, of course, my family did not know about my situation at that time.   When I was pregnant I then started travelling long distances to visit Pax in prison.  At first they put him in Standerton Gaol, which is far away.   I left home at 4 o'clock one morning with some friends and some of his family, my sister-in-law, and we drove six hours to Standerton, and when we got there they refused to let me see him.   They would only allow the others to see him.   I had a big fight with the prison commander and I told him that I was going to report him to Pretoria.   Straight after that they transferred Pax to ... (inaudible) ...  and the commander there was a black officer.   And the irony of it was that there it was apartheid working in our favour, because I was an \"mlungu\", I was allowed to have contact visits with him.  So, instead of us just talking through the bars, we used to be able to have contact visits.  But our letters to each other were censored, anything political in the letters was taken out.   This was a very lonely time of life for me, because my relationship with Pax was still in quite a formative stage, and I wanted to share my pregnancy with him.   I wanted us to be able to face the world together, but we could not do that.   My parents and brothers and sister didn't know anything about this aspect of my life.   They didn't know that Pax was in gaol.   I had by then told my sister that I was pregnant.   It was only many years later that I told my sister about Pax being in gaol, and all those things.   Where my pregnancy was concerned, my brothers and sister did not stand by me at all.  They didn't want my parents ever to know about my pregnancy, they were just - they believed that my father would have a heart attack, because he had one when I was in the States before, and he was a very excitable man.  So, they pressured me to have an abortion, or to leave the country, or to go very far away without explaining anything to my parents, and I refused to do those things.   Then after Maboya was born, I hoped maybe some how my brother and sister would try to mediate things in a way with my parents, to try and soften the blow for them, but they didn't do that.   Maybe it was asking for too much.  And anyway maybe mediation would not have helped, I think the situation was a traumatic one for them as well.   Pax was still in prison when Maboya was born in 1985.   It was Pax who gave him the name and the name is expressive of our wish that Pax would be able to return and we could be together again.    I was very lucky to have the support of a close friend when he was born.   I told the doctor at Addington Hospital that Pax' parents would visit me, because they had welcomed me into their family and they were very supportive of me.   And I didn't want them to experience any unpleasantness if they came to visit me in hospital.   So, I was put in a room on my own, near the ward entrance, and the nurses some how, I think they tended to forget about me.   One of the nurses later told me that there had been a big debate amongst all the nurses, some of them saying I had no right to bring this baby into the world because he was an outcast, and others saying that the fault was with the system and I was not to blame.   And this made me to wonder whether the mix up with blood samples that happened after Maboya was born was just an accident and carelessness, or whether it was actually something deliberate.   I have an A minus blood group, and Maboya is positive, which means that I should have an anti-D injection within 72 hours, so that my next baby would not be born a rhesus baby.   But what happened was that when Maboya was three days old the doctor examined him and said he was healthy, he could be discharged, he could go home.  I still had to stay in hospital a bit.   Then I noticed that he had a running eye and a rash and I asked the nurse to check it.   And she took him to a different doctor and that doctor came back to me and he said, \"Your baby has got very very serious anaemia, we can't discharge him, we must give him a blood transfusion and antibiotics\".   This was just within a few hours of him having been said he was fit to go home.  And it was only when they checked my blood and checked his blood to give him the blood transfusion that they discovered that he didn't have a negative blood group which is what the file said he had, he had a positive blood group.  So, I then had the anti-D injection, but it came later than I was told it should have been.  So, those are the kinds of things that just made me ask whether it was just carelessness, because I had heard a lot of horror stories about hospitals, or whether it was something worse than that.   Pax' parents visited me in hospital, they were very supportive, and many of my friends were very supportive, but I had no contact with my own family, except for my sister, who came to visit me after I had left hospital.   And I think she was - she came to be able to go and report to my mother, does this baby look a bit white or does he not look a bit white, because my mother had hidden the whole thing from my father.   She didn't want to tell him anything.   Then after Maboya was born, I took him to visit Pax and he saw his son for the first time in gaol.   My father took the news about his grandchild really very badly.   I went home without telling them that I was coming and I took the baby with me.   And after that I realised I would not go home again without being invited.   After that my parents moved from Richmond, where they were living, to their farm near Hella Hella.  It was my impression that they were trying to move away from people who might hear about the situation to avoid the social stigma which they felt.   My parents never accepted my choice of Pax as a partner, they never once met him, or spoke to him, except for the odd accidental telephone call my mother would phone and he would happen to pick up the phone, and then she would say, \"Can I speak to Marie Odendaal\" and if she didn't know who he was and I think she was trying to deny the existence our relationship.  They just could not overcome their apartheid beliefs which were also so strongly promoted by the Dutch Reformed Church.   I think they thought that what I had done was wrong, it was disgusting, it was shameful, it was disgraceful, and it was also still illegal at that time, because the Immorality Act had not yet been repealed.   And they felt that I had brought shame and disgrace on them and that was made visible in the person of my child.   My father particularly rejected me.   ",

He was still generous, he would give me vegetables from his garden and so on, but there was this big barrier between us.   He was never again able to respond to me warmly and freely.   My mother also loved me, and she was kind to Maboya and she really tried to treat him as a welcome grandson.   She also could not come to terms with my choice.

            "... my mother came rushing down when she realised it was me and so we just had to go into the kitchen and have a cup of tea, and then drive away again, and Maboya still asking when are we going to see the cows, because I promised him he would see the cows on the farm.   I think my mother suffered terribly emotionally in that whole situation.   When Maboya was about 10 months old, Pax came out of gaol on bail pending an appeal.   At that time from when he was three months old I was living with friends, Anita Kromberg and Richard Steele, and they were involved in the end conscription campaign and conscientious objector support group.   They were on the run from security branch at that time.   So, I was working, I was running a winter school for the career information centre at the time and the security branch and the police came at night just before the winter school was due to start.  Richard and Anita were not there.   And I was not cooperative with them, but they went away again.  After two weeks Pax had just come out of gaol, it was our first evening of being together again, because his first two evenings he spent at home in Lamontville with his parents, and then he came to the house in Bellair.   And we were sitting in the lounge and he heard the sound of an engine and he said, \"That's the cops\", because his ear was tuned, he could recognise it.   So, I quickly phoned a friend and then they arrived and it was the military intelligence and the security police.   And they came on the pretext of searching the house for drugs, because they said the next door neighbours had complained about drugs.   And it was very ironic because the next door neighbour used to smoke dagga with the police in the garden and here were they coming to our house.   So, I remember at that time we had Nusa education charter campaign pamphlets and we had ECC pamphlets and we hid them quickly under the mattress, the baby's mattress.   So, when the police came in, I was very uncooperative to them and they decided to detain me and I know that they did it merely out of spite because they spoke to each other in Afrikaans, maybe thinking that I could not understand them, but I understood them and they were just taking me in to cool me off.   So, I was held in solitary confinement at Westville Prison for 10 days under state of emergency.   There was only one other woman in the whole block of cells at the other end of the corridor.  When the warders realised that we were communicating with each other, they moved her away, and I was left alone in that cell block.  I was not physically ill-treated and I was only subjected to one mild interrogation by the person who detained me, his name was Erasmus.   I was reminded of that by Jeremy Radledge(?) because he was detained and questioned by the same man.  I am not sure of his rank, whether he was captain or what.   But he said to Jeremy he complained about me after the first visit to the house, that I had been cheeky and if it had not been for the baby he would have detained me, and then on the second visit he did detain me.   So, the only thing I was worried about, I didn't know how long they would keep me and Maboya was supposed to be receiving medication and he had to visit the hospital for a check up on his foot.   So, I didn't know really how long I would be kept there.   And then Pax succeeded in obtaining a visit and he brought Maboya and just 10 minutes after I saw them I was then called from my cell and told to get my things together and then I was driver of the vicinity of my home and released.   So, after about a year of Pax being out on bail and reporting regularly to the police station, he then lost his appeal.  I was devastated by that, and I will never forget having to drive him back to gaol in ... (inaudible) ... driving him myself.   I was really alone again without him, but knowing that I didn't really know the real truth about the terrible experiences that he was being subjected to in gaol.   Then I was very shocked one evening when the lawyer phoned me and told me that he had been granted a second appeal because the first one was in the Bloemfontein Supreme Court and the second one was going to be in Pietermaritzburg, or vice versa, I am a bit confused about it now.   The one was national and the other was Natal.   So, then he was released on bail again after about a year and in that time we moved up to Pietermaritzburg and he had to commute to Durban three times a week to report to the police station, which was very costly.   The prosecutor would not condone an application for him to report in Pietermaritzburg.   He could not get work under those conditions and we struggled to survive financially.   In September 1989 I received a phone call from my mother, she sounded terrible.   I thought my father had died, but she told me that my oldest brother had been killed.   She never recovered from this grief, she was very very bitter about it afterwards.  He had been murdered by two African men.   The defence claimed in court that he had accosted the men for climbing through a farm fence and threatened them with a rifle and that they had acted in self-defence when they attacked him with an axe.   When I recall his attitudes to black people, I think I can have some idea of how this confrontation might have come about.   And maybe those men hated white men for the treatment they had received at their hands.   I had only seen this brother once, Willem, in the four years since Maboya was born, and that was by accident, because he didn't want to have anything to do with me at all.  My father had been very ill in hospital with diarrhoea and a psychologist told me that it was depression causing the diarrhoea.   And I had bumped into my brother at the hospital there.   And at his funeral it was also the first time that I saw his children, who were my nieces, of whom I had been very very fond, and it was the first time they knew that I had a child.  It was the first time that they got an idea of why I had become the invisible member of the family.   Even recently, a month or so ago, their mother told me that my oldest niece doesn't want to come to a family reunion if we try to have one, because I am married to a black man and it was black people who killed her father and then later her grandparents.   So, of course Pax could not go with me to my brother's funeral, because this would have been like a red rag to a bull.   After my brother's death, we decided to have another child and to get married.   Up until then I had not wanted to get married, because - or I didn't want to have another child, because I didn't want to risk being all on my own again if he lost his appeal, but it seemed as if we were just at the mercy of the State, we were just waiting for the State to decide our lives, and we didn't want to live that way.   So, we got married in March 1990, in Lamontville, and I was five months pregnant at the time with my second baby.   Nobody from my family came to our wedding.   Four months later, on July 7th, 1990, my parents were murdered on their farm at Hella Hella.   I was visiting Pax' family in Lamontville when I received a phone call from my landlady.   I can remember very clearly that that was a lovely sunny winter's day, and in the morning I had thought it was a beautiful day, I wish I could visit my parents on the farm, but I knew that I couldn't do that, especially not being pregnant.  And I remember we talked about my parents in the car going down to Durban.   So, the next day a friend drove me to the farm and I saw the bloodstains in the road and on the farm house floor where my parents had been battered to death.   I also saw my sister and my second brother, Piet, for the first time since Willem's funeral.   Although I had visited my parents once or twice with Maboya, after I was pregnant with Nsigeya I had not been free to visit them.  It was as if this pregnancy and our marriage were rubbing salt in their wounds.   It signalled that our relationship was permanent, it wasn't just some kind of a bad mistake.   So, my parents and I were not reconciled before they died.  In their will they disinherited me from any share in the bulk of their estate, although they left me, and I believe it is my mother who left it to me, some money and a share of furniture and the piano I had when I was a child.   It is still a source of pain to me that we were not reconciled.   I also see that the apartheid system contributed in many ways to the situation which made them a target for attack and vulnerable victims.  Their attackers stole weapons from the house.   At the time there was conflict between the ANC and the IFP in the Pateni area, and I think maybe that is what the weapons were taken for.   My parents were amongst the first of the farming community in the midlands area to be killed.   The farming community, especially elderly people, have become a target for those people who want to continue with violence.   The day after my parents were murdered, our second child was born by caesarian section.   We named our baby Nsikelelo, which means blessing or comfort.   As with my brother's funeral, I could not go to my parents' funeral with my husband and children at my side.   The situation in Richmond was very tense, the local farmers were meeting, so we heard, and Pax might not have been safe to set foot there.   So, I left Nsigi in hospital and I went to my parents' funeral with friends.    In December 1990 Pax heard that he had lost his final appeal, and he decided to go into exile in the Transkei rather than going back to prison.   I was alone again looking after two children and a baby and I found it difficult to be a good parent.   The children were negatively affected by the whole situation, especially Maboya.   I had to tel him not to talk about daddy to other people, because I was afraid that Pax could be caught.   Although the police did not come and question me about his whereabouts, I was aware that they might be watching me.  This feeling was reinforced by an odd burglary of our home one day, when a burglar guard was forced and a gift of liquor and glasses removed from the lounge coffee table.   The hi-fi speakers thrown on the floor, but nothing else taken.  It did not seem like a real burglary.   While Pax was in exile two men were brought to trial for my parents' murder and I attended the case.   The police investigation, which was handled by the Pietermaritzburg Murder and Robbery Squad was very poorly conducted.   For instance, although the suspects were arrested very early, there were long delays before ID parades were held.   Also, the freshly cut log with which my parents were beaten to death was not weighed and measured at the time.   This was told to me just the other day by Captain du Plessis, who was the station commander at Richmond at the time.  When the case came to court many months later, that log was just a dried up stick that was not heavy enough or not considered heavy enough to inflict a fatal injury on a human skull.  The induna on my father's farm, who was the chief witness, Mr Willie Shezi, had told Pax and me that he had been beaten up by the police who suspected him of being involved in the murder.  Mr Shezi also died before the case came to court, so the chief witness was gone.   The two accused men were found not guilty.  It seems to me that that was merely on technical grounds.   But I accept that the verdict was fair if there was not sufficient evidence to prove that they were guilty, and to this day I don't know who murdered my parents, and whether they did so because they hated my parents specifically or they hated white people in general, or just because they wanted those weapons.   I know that my parents were old and defenceless and did not deserve to die in that brutal way.  In the meantime, I continued to try to fight for Pax to be granted indemnity while he remained in the Transkei, in exile.   In this we were assisted by Advocate P... (inaudible) ... Maduna of the ANC.   Advocate Maduna informed us that he was able to obtain a gentleman's agreement with the State that if Pax would hand himself over he would have to serve 30 days in gaol, after which he would be released and his case closed.   We did not know whether to accept this deal, because we did not feel we could trust the State and it was like asking Pax to walk into the lion's den, to go back into gaol.   But it seemed untenable for him just to remain on the run indefinitely, so he surrendered himself after nine months in exile, and he was put in Westville Gaol, and released at the end of 30 days.   As far as we are aware he was never formally granted amnesty and he still has a criminal record to his name.   It would make a difference to all of us if we could know that he has formally been granted indemnity.   Since 1992 we have tried to establish a normal family life.   This has not been easy.  Pax suffered from post traumatic stress disorder.   He began drinking a lot and he could not get a sense of direction, and I also had to work through a lot of trauma.  But we have been very fortunate to have access to a psychologist.  Maboya also, at one stage, had to have treatment for depression.   In October last year, Pax succeeded with the help of Sanca in stopping drinking and he is now doing a training course in arts administration, which may lead to job prospects for him.   Although I am reconciled with my sister, Fransie and her family, I have not seen my brother Piet or any of his family since my parents' funeral.   I do not feel bitter towards any of them, least of all my parents, whom I believe were the best parents it was in their power to be to me when I was growing up, they were loving parents.   I don't know, I don't have an inside picture of what kind of a policeman my father was, I don't know how he treated black people, I don't know about the many things he had to do to uphold the system of apartheid.   But I have a sense that I have made my peace with him, especially after I viewed this series about De Kok on TV this past week and I thought about my father and I saw that my father was really, I mean, I could not even begin to make a comparison between these two men when I see how policemen in this country have been subjected to the propaganda of the Nationalist Government and structures like the Dutch Reformed Church, not only policemen, but Afrikaans people in general, everyone.  I think we all have been victims, everyone in my family, the people who murdered my brother, the people who murdered my parents.   Despite Pax and my hardships, we have been very fortunate in many ways, we have received support from many people and I think this would be a very one sided testimony if I did not really emphasize that that is the hope for our country that so many people reach other to each other and reject the system and have shown love and have rejected racism.   And that would be my appeal to my fellow South Africans, black and white, and especially to my fellow Afrikaners, is to reject racism, to reject any ideology which tells you that other people are less human than you are, but to see yourself in that other person when you look at that other person, and to see that other person within you.   So, we are hopeful now as a family that our lives will begin to take a turn for the better and that we will be able to make a contribution to the building of a more peaceful, tolerant and just society.

We grew up as children who had problems, to such an extent that my brother, elder brother, Riot Mkwanazi, was involved in politics and he ended up being incarcerated in Robben Island.   And we grew under those circumstances.   And I, myself, realised that all the chances and the opportunities that I was supposed to have got I didn't really get.   Then I ask myself as to why my brother had joined politics, but when I realised that I couldn't go on with my education, I realised that my brother was fighting a battle.   Then at that stage I decided to give myself in.   Then in 1963, that's when I had just had my first born, and I looked at the situation critically and I wanted to follow my brother's footsteps.  After quite some time I realised that I was deep into politics, but there was no one who knew about my involvement.   And I did not want to be disturbed, nor seen, so I wanted to engage myself in some other business so that I would conduct my political activities underground.   I started selling liquor, so that I could not be recognised as a politician.   And then in 1982, I suspected that we were suspects, because a certain man from my home was arrested.   And they did not ask me anything about this very same man who was arrested, and I told him that I knew nothing because I was just selling liquor.   But they followed the matter up.  And then in 1982 I saw many cars arriving at my place.  These were police cars as well as police dogs.   And they said I should point out the weapons.   They got into the house.  I had quite a very big house at the F Section, Mazakele.  At that time it wasn't a usual practice that a person would have such a big house and they used to call my house \"Hyperama\" because of its size.   I was expectant with Nkananipo, when the boers came to my house.   When they got to my house they ransacked the house, checking and searching the weapons, and I was highly expectant and that time, I didn't know what to do.   But I was very sure that there were no weapons.   They searched the whole house, they couldn't find any.   And they used to frequent my place, they would even come at night, we could not sleep, because they used to come several times.  My husband was not working at that time and we felt that we were not safe at that particular place.   And even the comrades who used to come to my place were no longer safe, because the boers used to frequent my place looking for weapons.   Then in 1984 we decided that we should sell the house and move to another place called Lindelani, where we could live peacefully, because it was a place that was quite closer to town and we were able to send the children to school and also work.   We moved to Lindelani.   Within a few days, I think it was about a week, Shabalala came to Lindelani and he had also bought a stand.   He built his house.   And some others who needed help, who came to build at that place also requested help from us.  But along the way Shabalala wanted to be the boss of that place, he wanted to take everything under his control.  We stayed for quite some time and some things were happening in Lindelani.   And we could not do anything about whatever was happening, but we used to conduct certain meetings with the UDF ... (inaudible) ...",

            "... announcing that there was going to be a youth meeting and the youth would come.   And we would talk about the main objectives of this league as well as the UDF organisation, about the oppression that we were going through.   And later on Shabalala realised that my family was involved in politics, because whenever he used to call the youth, nobody would go to his meetings, and we also wouldn't go to his meetings because we felt we were not obliged.   We were citizens and we had a right to stay in that place.   But Shabalala later on, when we were attacked, he said he knew nothing about the attack, because on that particular day he left having given out instructions that we should be attacked, especially the business people, because I also had a shop and Shabalala had given an instruction that I be attacked.   I think at that time he went to Newcastle.   It was on a Sunday, February 1985, at two in the afternoon I was at the shop.  I had a very big tuckshop.   Because the community of Lindelani didn't have any shops nearby.   I had somebody announcing over the loudspeaker saying, \"Mrs Mbatha, get out of that place\".   And the children were scared, they were saying we were going to die.   And we already heard that people had died and their shops had been looted and they had taken some of the possessions as well as stocks from the shop.   I decided to go outside to hear as to what they wanted from me.  When I got out I saw a cloud of dust and I saw two groups carrying weapons.   They were carrying tin stuff, foodstuff and all sorts of things that you can get from the shop.  And I stood in front of Khanyile.   Khanyile was the one who was leading this group and he was giving the orders as to who should be attacked.   And he was the one who was responsible for all these announcements.   I stood in front of them and Khanyile said it in the loudspeaker and said, \"Today we have come to the Mbatha family, Lambatha(?) has said blood must spill, but now we are carrying quite a lot of things and we would have to go and off-load all the stocks that we have, and we would come back to fetch some\" and they were starting to quarrel, they wanted to take my possessions.   One was saying I am going to take the generator, the other one was saying I am going to take a fridge.   And by then somebody came and I was amongst this group called \"Amabutho\" and this person from the car got off his car and approached us.   Then Khanyile said the instruction was that they should come and deal with me.  David asked as to whether that was the law or the rule that a person should be attacked, we want to be told as to what we have done, what was the motive for the attack, and Khanyile looked down upon my husband.   Then he told him that they were coming back.   When the first group moved away from my house and the second one followed with the stocks that they had taken from the other shops, I said this car should come home and when my husband drove the car into my yard, I took quite a few things.   I took my TV, I took my fridges and I left the three others.  I took my children with.  And I told them that as we are going we don't know where we are heading for, but we are going to stay in the forest because we had no other place to run to.   I told my husband that we are going to stay in the forest.   We want the world to see what is happening to us because we have been writing to Buthelezi about the things that were happening in Lindelani.  We haven't yet got an answer.   Now, this attack is taking place on us personally.   Now, we should publicize this and make it known so that the world may know.   We drove to Ntuzuma Training Centre at the forest near the road.   We off-loaded the children.   We were not armed, we had absolutely nothing with us.   We stayed next to the road.  Unfortunately my generator had gone in for service.   Then certain dominees came.   They brought a tent and they said we should just cover ourselves.   They asked us what the problem was.  They said they wanted to accommodate us.  And we said they should just help us pray.",

They went away and came back in the morning, and Shabalala told us that he had come during the night and that he foresaw that we were going to shoot him because he did not know why we had left Lindelani and he knew nothing about our leaving Lindelani.   I told him that he was supposed to know because Amabutho did not just act all by themselves, they were given specific instructions to do certain things.  Whenever people have been pointed out to them, they would go to attack those particular persons.   Then Mhlongo who was an MP from Mapumulo, Mhlongo came to me in the forest where I was staying.  he said he had been sent by Buthelezi to come and ask us as to why we were staying in the forest, then I explained it to him.   Then it was said that the minister had said that we should move away from that place, we should take the children and he wanted us to move to Section G in KwaMashu.   I declined the offer because we are not the first ones who were being harassed by members of Amabutho and some lost their lives and we do not know how.

            "  I am Ignatian Ntombikulu Ntalani.   We were six from the family where I was born.   They are all dead.   My parents died when I was 7 years old.   Today I have my sister here with me.   I have a brother, Michael, and a sister, Mamsie(?).  We grew up very poor and we were taken by relatives because our parents died when we were very young.   I got married to the Ngubane family.   My husband left me because of something very bad that happened to my life.   I would like to relate my story from the age of 18 years.   When I was 18 years old I joined a nursing training in 1960, in King George.   Me and the other nurses we joined together, we talked about the unhappiness and the misery that we met at work.   We joined ANC.   There were many of us.   We engaged on boycotts.   Even though we were working but we were like engaged in collective bargaining.   During lunchtimes we used to go to the management and we used to negotiate with the management and tell them the things that we were not happy about.   At that time I was a member of ANC together with the other nurses.   One day we were called, 17 of us.   They told us to resign.  We were forced to resign because we were the leaders of the ANC.  We had no choice but to resign and we lost our jobs.  After a while I heard that people were hired in King Edward, so I went to King Edward, many of us were there who also heard that King Edward had been employing people.  When I arrived there, one man called me and told me that, \"You see, there is your name, your name has been blacklisted, you can't be admitted in this hospital because your previous matron said you are bad\".   I realised that things were bad for me and I went back home. I used to visit offices, ANC offices, because I had a problem.   After that, in 1962 ANC was banned and ANC leaders were arrested, some people went to exile.  The offices were left behind, empty, with no one in them, and then I realised that it was up to me to go in those offices because they were now empty.   The special branch used to come and harass me.   I remember one day as I was walking down the street, I had one guy, his name is Israel Ndimande, who was also working in those offices, I hired him to come and work with me in those ANC offices.  Some times they used to just arrest me in the street and Israel Ndimande will realise by not seeing me coming back that I have been arrested.   In 1963 they gave me a banning order, they told me not to move around, I was in Pinetown at that time, I wasn't at Umlazi, F Section.   I stayed at Pinetown but the police used to come and question me, interrogate me.  They used to interrogate me until I was confused because all of them they used to ask me different questions and I was confused really.   One day they arrested me.  My brother was getting married.   When my brother came and ask me to go to a shop with him so that I choose clothes to buy for his marriage, we went to Sales House.   I used to disguise the way I used to dress myself, it was like in disguise, like an old lady.   One day, Nyathi caught me, I was with my sister.   He said to me what are you doing here in Durban, you are supposed to be in Pinetown, because you are being banned to walk around up to Durban.   I apologised to him and then he said to me I can only do that if you sign here, I signed and then he left - he let go of me.   My sister went to Sales House and I decided to take a taxi or a bus back to Pinetown.   When I was talking to my sister then white policemen came and they were there.   I tried to hide.  I ran.   Within 30 minutes I was back in Pinetown.  I went to the police station to report and then I walked back home.   After two days, I am not certain if it was two or three, they told me that I was needed in Pinetown Court.  I went to the Pinetown Magistrate's Court, he told me to go to Durban Magistrate Court.   They told me that I am facing a charge that I left Pinetown for Durban when I wasn't supposed to do so.   Because the law didn't allow us to talk to a lot of people if we were banned.   I went to see my lawyer, Bagwandeen.   I was pregnant at that time.   Bagwandeen asked me how can it be if they can just give me a suspended sentence, so that I see doctors and I go to clinic, they told my lawyer that there is - there are doctors in hospital, and I will see them.  They send me to Durban Prison for a month.  After a month they called me.  They told me that I am alone in my cell, I am not with other people, therefore I am consuming a lot of space for other prisoners.   So, they were going to change me and send me to Jo'burg Prison.   They send me to Ford(?) Prison in Johannesburg.   I stayed there in a very small cell, the toilet is closer, it wasn't even a toilet, it was just a tin where you used to go and relieve yourself.   I stayed there and I was sleeping on the floor, on the floor on the cement, it was cold.  There was no doctor.   I think I stayed there for something like two to three months, and then they called me there, they asked me if I am a nurse, I said, yes, I am.  So, they told me you must come, we are going to put you in a prison hospital, so that you will be able to help other prisoners because you are having a nursing experience.   That's where I started sleeping in a bed, this was in prison hospital.   But it was late already.   I stayed a few months and then I delivered my child.   And the person who delivered my child was a nurse who was a prisoner as well, who got there because of shoplifting.  There were no doctors.   The next day I found my child yellow and because I had this nursing experience I knew it was jaundice.   I suspected jaundice, so I told the doctors that my child wasn't well, and I think he is suffering from jaundice.   So, they took my child, they told me they are taking him to another cell in hospital.   When I asked them how can they take my child when he is sick and leave me behind, I am supposed to breastfeed my child, they told me, \"You are a prisoner\" and then the next day they came back and they told me that, \"Your child is dead\".   I asked them how can I contact my family so that they give a decent funeral to my child, because I am behind bars, they told me that, \"You can't contact your family, this child will be buried by the government\".   I don't know up until today if my child is still alive or really my child died.   This is what they told me that the child had died.  I stayed there until just before I could be released.  Two days before they called me to the office.  When I arrive in that office I saw three white policemen and one black policeman.  When I arrived there they introduced themselves, they said they were from Pretoria.  They said they were not going to release me until they take photographs of me.   They took me outside the yard, they took the photographs.   30 minutes went by, they wanted every angle of myself, so they took photographs.   And when we went back, I realised that I didn't have clothes, because my clothes have been taken by other prisoners.  Then they released me, they gave me a blanket.  They took me by their car and they left at Park Station in Johannesburg.  I took a train and I arrived in Durban.  I went to Durban Prison, I reported that I was released.  I went back to Pinetown, because five years wasn't yet over.  I was banned for five years, I stayed there until it was over, then I returned back to Umlazi and home.   When all these things were happening I had a brother who was a CID, who was working in Smith Street.  SB police were harassing him, because they were accusing him of having a sister who was a ANC.   They were harassing him until he told him that he was going to docket - a case for them, because he wasn't ANC, his sister was.   Even if when I was in Clermont, they were harassing them, even though they knew that it was me who was an ANC member, not my family, but they were interrogating them.  They were harassing them.",

IO went to a coloured family to work there and she told me that she was going to buy me a bed the next day in that coloured house, because I was sleeping there, but she made me sleep on the floor.   Over the weekends I would go and visit my children.   One day as I was going to visit my children, when I arrive at his sister's place, my children were not there.   I asked his sister and his sister said to me, \"Your husband took your sister.   He said he was going to Inanda with them\".   And then something rang a bell in my head.   I said I am going to look for a certain church at Inanda.   When I arrived there, my children were staying there without food.   And only the last one was given food, because my - his eldest sister would go to a reverend's house and ask for food for him.   At that time my husband is staying with this women, they aren't married, they are just staying together.   And he will go there for four days and if he is not there the children will not have food.    We can understand that but we just want to know exactly what happened, what was the end?   What was the end of the story?   ---   What he did, he took this women and left for Johannesburg, and married the woman there.  They left for Johannesburg.   This happened in 1983, up until today.  Sometimes he will take my sons and leave with them for Jo'burg.   ",

She had two stab wounds and Busi was sitting on the bed and she thought she had actually hidden herself, but it was very apparent that she was there.   I went into my mother's bedroom, and I saw my mother sleeping on the bed.   I did not realise that at that time she was dead.  And they had already burn the outer building.   And I saw my mother.  I told myself because she had high blood pressure, I thought maybe she has just lost consciousness.  Then I went into the bedroom.   Before I opened the water, I could see the petrol where they had spilt it, before setting the house alight.   I did not care, I went around trying to extinguish the fire, because I thought the worse had happened so I had nothing more to fear.   When I went to the outside room, I found that my child had hidden.  He got in the dustbin and when they set the house alight they realised that there was nobody inside and all the time he had hidden himself in the dustbin.   When I opened I realised that I could not open the door.   When they kicked the door, probably the key fell down and the child was inside the house.

We took her to the hospital, but they said they could not help her, and they said they were going to transfer her to King Edward.   Then I said I was going to accompany my mother.  I was still very confused because I was also bleeding and I was wearing a nightdress.  At that time, it didn't really strike my mind I was not dressed, because I was very confused at that stage.

            "  Yes, I must say I have been listening for the last two days to the truth and reconciliation commission and it is very difficult, almost impossible, not to have arrived here this evening feeling an enormous amount of anger.   I would also like to thank you for the dignity which this panel has conducted the proceedings of today and I would like to thank Makhosi for being here next to me.   My anger is partly also one of outrage that I believe that everything that we have heard today and yesterday and whatever has happened for the last 50 years in this country has been done in the name of my culture.   I was born in Stainsburg in the Karoo in 1941 and I grew in Malmesbury, where my father was principal of the Swartland Laerskool.   So, I had an Afrikaans upbringing with the Dutch Reformed Church dominating the town, with cousins in the Broederbond who for the 30 years after I became political severed all ties with my family. As an adolescent in the early 1950s I moved to Port Elizabeth and I think it was the contrast with Malmesbury that crystallized for me my hatred of poverty and injustice that I saw around me.   It was also in the Eastern Cape/Port Elizabeth that I heard Nkosi Sikelele sung in my school around in the background.  It was also the time when SACTO(?) was producing newspapers selling them in the streets of Port Elizabeth. By the early 1960s when I was at the University of Cape Town, studying physiotherapy I had come to the painful realization that the poverty, that Sharpeville and detention without trial were ways in which my own people were trying to claw their way into white privilege in our country. I never spoke Afrikaans again until my return from exile in 1990. At UCT I sought and found radical students, and more importantly I became involved in a committee of the defence and aid fund, at a time when the 90 day law providing for detention without trial was introduced.  This work brought me in touch with an older generation of women stalwarts, like Ray Edwards, who was to become my mother-in-law later on, Dora Alexandra, Sara Khanisan and her husband Fred.  I was recruited into the South African Communist Party and almost simultaneously before I understood the rapidly unfolding political process around me, I was also recruited into a sabotage unit of the ARM.   On June, the 18th, 1964, sentences were handed down in the Rivonia trial.   Death sentences seemed possible leading up to that date and probably were averted by the massive international campaign for the release of South African political prisoners.   We, in the sabotage unit that I was involved in, carried out various acts of sabotage to coincide with these sentences.   For me those four and a half years in Cape Town were one of increasing cultural isolation, they were frightening and they were bewildering years.   On the 4th of July 1964, there were country wide security clamp down, with many arrests in terms of the relatively new detention without trial laws.  I was arrested a week later.   I was help first in Maitland Police Cells and interrogated two or three times a day.  I must point out that my arrival and my attempt to make a home in Durban is new.   I am not really a Durban or a KwaZulu-Natal person, but I have chosen to come here and I felt very good to be part of this community of women here today.   After about three weeks after my detention I was transferred to Caledon Square Police Station in central Cape Town.   Interrogations continued, verbally, rough, but I could hold my own.   In all this time I never saw a woman.   There were teams of special branch men.  I was in solitary confinement, guarded by uniformed men and seeing only males on the rare occasions that I saw other prisoners.   Then a bomb exploded on the Johannesburg Station.   In detention in Cape Town, all I knew was that there was a sudden outpouring of aggression from the interrogators.   A woman of 77 died soon after the bomb and her four year old grandchild was badly injured.  I have recently heard mention of this child who is now a woman in her 30s.   I heard that she has continued to suffer from this experience and I feel a very deep grief for her, although I was not directly involved in what befell her.   On the day in question, the 1st of August 1964, I was taken upstairs from the cells in Caledon Square to a small room, a storeroom it seemed, with packing cases and a table.  I was told to remain standing and throughout the day special branch rotated through to interrogate me.   I remember Captain Rossouw, who was in charge;   Lieutenant van Dyk;   Sergeant Spuiker van Wyk, who was already notorious and implicated in the death of Luke Sowandle Legudle, who was a commander in Ukhonto we Siswe in Cape Town.  There was also his side-kick, Van Wyk's side-kick, Sergeant Theo Sandberg.   Standing and sleep depravation were new methods and I was not aware that later comrades like Fred Khanisan would be kept awake for a week on end.   I stood from the morning through the day and into the night.  The Cape Town special branch was soon joined by Lieutenants Fichter and Van der Merwe from Johannesburg, fresh and rampantly triumphant, boasting that they had arrested John Harris for the Johannesburg Station bomb and smashed his jaw, getting him to sing like a canary, a favourite phrase of the special branch at that time.   John Harris was subsequently charged and he was hanged in Pretoria on the 1st of April 1965.  He was a 27 year old teacher, with a wife, Anne, and a four year old son.   I didn't know John Harris, but when he was hanged in Pretoria I happened to be held in the death cell reserved for white women in Pretoria Central Prison.  All night I heard the prisoners signing, \"God be with you till we meet again\".   In the morning a 19 year old wardress with uncommon sensitivity took some risk in coming to the spy hole of my cell to tell me John Harris had been hanged.   Since then on the 1st of April every year, I have almost unwillingly recalled John Harris and relived the pain of that hanging.   But before that, on the 1st of August, my interrogation went on.   Fichter grew increasingly impatient with my recalcitrance, I was small fry, he resented that I was holding out.   Then in the early hours of the following morning, the 2nd of August 1964, Captain Rossouw came in again and said that his men were treating me too well, that this was a war.   Rossouw said he was very sorry that we had used women, but if I wanted to behave like a man, he would treat me like a man.  Spuiker van Wyk came in and pleaded with Rossouw to allow him to be alone with me.   In retrospect it was clear that he was seeking permission to use violence to break me.  Rossouw hesitated while Van Wyk wined on like a school boy wanting a chance to prove himself.   Eventually Rossouw got up and left.   Van Wyk from then on was crowing with glee and anticipation.   He stood close in front of me, the door shut.   He kept saying, \"I know you hate me and you are going to hate me even more\".   I was exhausted and said,\"Yes, I hate you\".   Then he started hitting me across my head.  He grabbed my hair, which was long, and pulled me down to the floor and started battering my head on the floor.  I lost consciousness.   I came around, there were other people in the room.   Someone shouted, \"Get up\" and I pulled myself over a chair on to my knees.  I was retching, I was shaking violently.  I heard somebody saying, \"That won't help you\".   Van Wyk was gone and Fichter was back alone with me in the room.   Clumps of my hair were strewn all over the floor.   He kicked some hair under the table.   He demanded that I make a statement.  I was completely incoherent.  But in that atmosphere Fichter chose to reprimand me for calling him Fichter and said I must call him Lieutenant Fichter.  I quote from a statement that I recently found which I had made soon afterwards to my attorney, Hymie Bernhout(?), in which I said that",

He told me to regard the security police as my friends and he touched the corner of my eye which was battered and bruised.  I was incoherent and unable to make a statement.  He took me back to my cell. At 5 o'clock in the morning Van Wyk and Sandberg appeared in the cell, still triumphant.   They said they would be back at 6.00 but they never came.  Later I learnt that the pair of them then went on to a comrade and then eventually a co-accused in another cell, Allan Brookes.   They also beat him and Sandberg sat on Allan and twisted his ankle until it broke.   I had just turned 23 and I learnt them the difference between fear and terror.

            "Spuiker van Wyk made a responding statement in which he admitted that he had hit me, but justified this by saying that I begged him to do so.    I started civil proceedings against BJ Vorster, then Minister of Justice, and Van Wyk.  Eventually IL was charged.  After sentence I was taken Kroonstad Women's Prison.   I was taken to many prisons, but that was one where I was.   Most of the time I was still in solitary confinement because at that time I was the only white woman political prisoner and as all else in the country the prisons too were segregated.   At Kroonstad the special branch came back, took me into the matron's office and started shouting at me.   I was only aware of a row of highly polished black shoes and my own terror.  I started screaming.   The matron of Kroonstad Prison then was a young woman called Erica van Zyl.  She rushed in and sent the special branch away.  She sat down with me and said that as long as I was in her prison, she would not allow the special branch near me. Now, 32 years later, the same Erica van Zyl is, I believe, head of the prison services in our country.   I think she is a brigadier now.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank her for her kindness then back in 1964, it was a very rare situation.  Eventually at the end of 1965, when I was 24, Vorster, who was still Minister of Justice, invited our parents to come to him to ask for our release.  My father made an appointment and saw him.  I was taken from Barberton Prison, where I was there by then, to be interrogated by the head of special branch, General H J van den Berg.   And curiously he could also not resist the temptation to ask me to hold his hands, to look into his eyes, and to swear at that time that I was not a communist.   I did so.   I was then released.  Both Vorster and Van den Berg in these interviews made it clear that they knew I had been beaten up and expressed no surprise nor protest about this.  The civil case against Vorster and Van Wyk was set down for hearing in Cape Town Supreme Court in mid 1966.  The week before the State made an out of court settlement.   What happened to me was just the beginning of a 30 years of horror which was subdued but stretched relentlessly as comrades and friends were killed in detention, hanged, bombed, murdered.   On my return from exile in September 1990, it seemed that we would sit in a meeting one day, I was then in Gauteng, in Johannesburg, and the next day comrades from the meeting would be dead.   There has been no time to recover.  I say it was subdued horror, because we lived by our own motto, \"Don't mourn, mobilize\".   I went into exile in September 1966 and became a stateless person.   Like thousands of other exiles I lived without my extended family.  My two sons were born in London and grew up without their grandparents, their cousins, their aunts.   They still have very little ability to form relationships within the family beyond their parents.   They learnt at a tender age not to handle our mail and not to touch parcels.  Their father was bombed in 1988 when they were 17 and 18 years old.   He does not like it when we say he was lucky, but he did survive with incredible spirit and optimism.  We were lucky.   I am honoured to have been part of the struggle and I am warmed by the remembrance of the love, support and comradeship we shared with people from all over the world, from Tanzania to Denmark, from Vietnam to the Soviet Union, and East Germany.   What happened in that police cell, in 1964, was never resolved for me as the deaths and torture, the brutality mounted against those struggling to end the scourge of apartheid, and pursued them with increasing voracity into exile, engulfing activists, those thought perhaps to have been sympathetic, their wives, their husbands, their lovers, their parents, and their children.   The growth of this murderous monster machine is perhaps typified by Lieutenant Fichter, who had interrogated me in 1964, by his growth into a colonel.   From the breaking of John Harris' jaw before Harris was hanged, Fichter went on to head the Ciskei Police, and finally to be charged for his complicity in the KwaMakhuta massacre.   Responsibility for all these acts must be laid at the feet of those individuals concerned, those perpetrators, and with the SADF and the SAP.   But I was born an Afrikaner, and from childhood we were fed, force fed if I might say on the glory of our people in the Anglo Boer War.   When eventually Pik Botha got his moment of glory at the united Nations, following the collapse of the apartheid state, he chose there to read a poem in Afrikaans to the world, by Louis Leipoldt, glorifying the suffering of the Afrikaner people.   For me the horror of the apartheid years is compounded by the loss to me through its prostitution of my language and my culture.   The direction that Afrikaner nationalism took into obliterating all in its wake now, no matter how murderously, I lay at the feet of the Broederbond, the Dutch Reformed Church and the National Party.   These bodies systematically fanned the flames and nurtured an increasingly Godless and brutalized culture.  Through the truth and reconciliation commission, and as an Afrikaner, I call on the Broederbond, the Dutch Reformed Church, EW de Klerk, and the National Party to do more than say sorry, it was a mistake, I call on them to confess and repent their seminal role in nurturing murder and mayhem in our country, based on an ideology of race superiority.  I must just end by saying that although I may seem very calm, although Makhosi knows that I am not, it has been a period in trying to write this statement that has helped me to put into perspective the pain that I felt.

Because that is going to make the difference to salvaging this nation, because some times reconciliation seems to be very cheap, and the price is often the cost of the victims, and I think that what we are really struggling with is what you have said in your last few remarks.   That we need for people to say more than it was a mistake.   We need for them to really come forward and repent, because only in that repentance will the rest of us be able to find some kind of solace that the reconciliation on which we are building this country will not be a cheap one.

            "  Okay.   I wanted to taper my account to fit in with the Truth and Reconciliation Act, to start from 1960, my political life goes long before that.   So, I have started as early as 1960 and told you that we were ordered, if detained, not to make statements.   I mean everybody said, if you are picked up, don't say a word, right.   And we had merely to give our names and addresses, but nothing else.   That soon changed with people like Stephanie Kemp, but it changed a little earlier, when we were faced with the torture, Indress Naidoo had been strung up in a bag, and beaten out of his mind and he had been shot in his arm.  And then we knew they were very serious.   So, people hadn't started to die by then in detention, but we knew that they were going to break us.  So, we altered it.  Say what needs to be said, no more.  Right.   Supposing they wanted to know were you at that meeting, confirm it, you know, don't keep saying, no, because then your body gets it.   Now, the evidence of Stephanie Kemp and her successful prosecution of her tortures left us in little doubt that force, violence, was going to be used.   Violet Wynberg, she is late now, spoke of her detention, and was one of the horrors of our life at that time, to see Violet, this elderly person, with her shoes covered with her swollen feet ...

            "... would rape them.   They were punished with no pads when they menstruated.   Lulu Gwala, Harry's daughter, had to wrap a blanket around herself when she menstruated, they wouldn't give her a pad.  I, myself, was arrested - no, sentenced, and they wouldn't give me pads, and I had to use newspapers.   Can you think of a worse thing that can happen to a woman?   You washed - we washed clothes, so you pick up the blood from your and put it into the washing.   It was horrible, and terribly demeaning.  And the other aspect of detainees was that they would let you not wash, you would stand for hours.  I think, Steph, you probably stood for three days without a wash.   And the smell of your body, you know, you are not washing, and then you go to the toilet, you are not allowed to wash, there is no toilet paper, and all these horrendous things happen to woman, and your self confidence went.   If mothers were detained, leaving their children behind, it was horrendous.   I went crazy 10 days detention leaving my three children behind, and Sathee(?) was two days old when that happened.   So, Nester Basel(?), I think you ladies haven't met some of the old women in the communist party trial, with Braam Fisher.   Six women were detained, and Nester was one of them.   Served long sentences.  She served three years and had absolute hell being away from her three young daughters.  Her children have never forgiven her.   I think just one is coming around now.  And then you read Ruth First's book on her 117 days.   And her detention.  I mean if you read that, I think they made a film of it too, isn't it.   She was suicidal with detention.   So, detention was no picnic as I say.   It was feared.   In fact, we in the underground, were told if somebody is detained, don't assume that they would not break, assume they would break and move out.   June the 16th, 1976, brought the detention of our children following the massive uprising.  They were several pregnancies due to rape by the detaining officers.  And I knew about this because I was working in the Harry Gwala trial and had to go and see witnesses like Helen Joseph and Lilian Ngoye.   And Lilian brought some of the mothers to me and said talk to them, Phyllis, let them do something about these children.   It was too late to abort.   So, they wouldn't.  They were - you see, they feared the special branch.   No, Phyllis, go away, go away, we are not going to do anything about it.  So, we lived in that very difficult period, detention, isolation.  Then subsequently of course you had all the deaths in detention.  And you know, that was a strong list, I think the TRC has a list of about 73 people, who were killed in political detention.  There are many more.   At first when I thought about how could we deal with women in detention and fear of rape and fear of violence and all that, and I thought it be best to employee women officers, but then I was held in Durban Central here, in an all women prison, and my God, what horrors they were.   They kicked your food, they spat at you.  I can't tell you, I don't know how, I was the only \"Indian\" and 400 African women, mindless treatment we all had.   And African women did it, except one, Marge Dlamini.   And when I said to her, \"What are you doing in this place?\", she said, \"Phyllis, if I don't stay here, people forget that there was something better outside\".   Anyway, so we will have to think about who looks after women detainees.   The wardresses now, these were women wardresses in Kroonstad gave Dorothy Nembe boiled hard mielies with her teeth all removed, sadists.   I mean, how do you eat those big mielies without teeth?   She was starving and hungry and a letter to me asking for R250,00 to get false teeth so that she could eat are very painful memories.   I suffered a banning order, five years at a time, two banning orders.  The second banning order was accompanied with a house arrest order from March 1966 to March 1976.   I was pregnant at the time, I was first banned and restricted to the magisterial area of Durban.   There is a man in the house here.  There is a man in the house.   (Pause)   Okay.  Overnight my job as a teacher was ended because you couldn't enter school premises, you couldn't enter educational premises, you couldn't go to libraries, you had six pages of restriction, I am sure all of you know about those things.   And later, with a husband on Robben Island, I was expected to care for three children, it was a horrendous punitive measure, worse, the Minister of Justice, that is a misnomer, would not give reasons for this invasion of my limited rights.  Instead the special branch asked me to make application for a child welfare grant, and what an insult, I refused.   I asked in a letter to him how could an unarmed pregnant mother of two young boys, five years and four years, threaten the military might of the regime?   They boasted they were the greatest army from Cape to Cairo, until of course they met the Cubans in 1988 at Quito Codovales, and thank God for that.   When the minister replied, he said it was not in the interests of security of the state to divulge the reasons for my restriction orders.   So, for 10 years, not knowing why, I had to report my presence to the police every Monday.   One morning I failed to report, when Shah, my son, had an asthmatic attack during my law exams.  I was sentenced to 10 days, those were 10 days that shook my world.   I want to know why I was banned, what do my police files say and I must tell you when I visited the once they had so much in my files, I want the police to return all my stuff they removed from my home, especially my short stories.  Exile for me for was from the 23rd of July 1977 to the 26th of June 1990.   I must tell you as an attorney I take statements from everybody and I had interviewed somebody who said, \"We were given the death penalty\", I said, \"When?\", he couldn't remember.   I said, \"When were you released from prison?\", you would think that somebody getting the death penalty will remember that, he couldn't remember.   Can you remember the days when your children were born?   No.   What can you remember?   Says nothing.   When did you go into exile?   The date, time, place.   So, exile sticks in your mind like nothing else does.   It is a hard life.  Two women helped me go into exile, one was Solvey Piper, she was here yesterday with the Turners, she kept me in her home for a night, and the other was a black woman and I am so sorry I have forgotten her name.   You know, I say here that one of the things we have to do was to forget, we dealt with Mrs Magwaza, we had to forget her, or we would be given another name, you know, and we had to forget her.  Well, she took me across, first of all she had me in her room in Clermont, a tin shack, with a huge hole at the bottom.   And she said to me if you walk across they will be able to see you, so sit here.   And she left her pot for me to do a job, there were no toilets so I couldn't go out to that, and a tin of Milo.  And Milo was so expensive in those days, still is, you know.   And she made sure that I - the quality of comradeship that I have enjoyed, you know, I could write books about it.   And this lady, I wish she hears me and I wish she would come and see me, because I need to thank her.   What worries me with the murder and mayhem in Natal, she might be dead.   A young girl, she could have been about 25 maybe.   My driver was too tired, and she wanted to sleep.  I had to drive during the petrol restrictions, and you know if you were caught carrying petrol, oh my, and I couldn't be caught, and we carried petrol, that was illegal.  I filled up at Escort late at night, terrified out of my wits.   Those who planned my trip said we should cross at Ficksburg, because that is where the river is so narrow looking at a map.   And one of those people who plotted my trip was Ric Turner.   And I mean they forgot that the sides of the river are so steep and I had to go down those sides losing my gloves, losing my shoes and losing my socks.   And I hit the river, ice cold morning at five - half past five, a freezing morning.   And of course, without shoes, my feet had to trample frost, it was the first time I heard -I knew what was frost.   Some advocates' reading of my self imposed exile laughed about it.  Well, I hope that exile is never their lot.  It is never but never self imposed.   That statement is stupid.   Ask my friend here.  We were underground operatives and we could not operate if our cell was intact.   And we could operate, sorry.   If a member of our cell was arrested, the others had to go into hiding.   I was ordered to leave the country and I left my three children without telling them I was leaving and the counsel who laughed at me should try that.  I thought exile was the ultimate punishment, until I lost my son.  You exist in exile like your body is here in Harare, Lesotho, and all, but your heart is at home.   Everything that happens, ask Nosiswe, she will tell you about how she met us in exile.   What was home for us?   We didn't have - you know, we didn't own any property, or anything.  There was no home.   We were tenants.   We would have to come back if ever and find a house to rent.   For some of my comrades, it was under the bridges that they were, you know, had lived.   It was in buses, you know.   For some they had come from gail to exile.   And the worse thing that can happen to you in exile, I think is to lose somebody.   Oliver Tambo lost his mother in exile.   And he was, you know, oh so hurt by it.   I lost my mother and my brother in exile.   It is very very painful.   It will take a book to describe exile and more.   Mandla Langa, my comrade, tells of his pained exile in his new book, \"The Naked Song\", I recommend it to you.  Many writers have written of the pain of exile.   I was 50 in exile.   50 years old.   I am nearly 70 now.  Can you imagine the pain of our 10 year old children in exile?    Somebody asked why were there so many suicides in the list of our dead the ANC submission to the TRC, I would say being in exile was a big part of that, you know, one ought to explain it.   At 50 I have stood at the banks of the Caledon River with its sandy belly open to the elements, with only a trickle of water for river, and wanted to return home.   Again and again.   It was Braam Fisher who had said, \"Better a South African prison than exile\".  You stand there and shall I, shall I not, shall I?   And you ask the Caledon River and of course it doesn't answer.   A exile was compounded by a parcel bomb that was sent to Cannon John Osmos, it was opened in my home, and I can't show you my backside, but it is full of potted holes.  I can't wear a bathing costume.   Right.   I have lost my ear, my eardrum has gone.   And I lost 7 teeth.   Four of my comrades were very badly hurt.  The church paid for John's medical care, while the ANC took care of the five of us.   You don't wish me to describe the pain of that, do you?   Thank you.   I was phoned daily in exile at 10 pm, somebody employed by the dirty tricks department, who would say, \"Is that Mrs Naidoo, we are coming to get you\".   \"Ons sal jou kry\".   Can you believe that someone's father, brother or son, would do a mindless stupid job like that?   And can you believe that he was paid by the state, your money, taxpayers money paid for him to be stupid.   I was sent to Hungary for medical care by the ANC and Hungary was in the Eastern Block.   And I want to tell you that their solidarity was a very precious experience.   My son, Sargan, was studying agricultural engineering there, it was Hungary's solidarity for the ANC.   There were 26 ANC students there, Sargan spend eight years, and for the eight years they took care of his food, his learning, his accommodation, you have no idea what solidarity we experienced.  But those countries were not as bad as the African countries.   And the solidarity we experienced in the poverty of Africa, was something else.   You have my book with you, and you will see what I say there.  My 11 year old daughter was phoned to say that they were coming to Maseru to finish the job they hadn't finished.   She thought it was my comrades playing the fool.  When she enquired further, she found that it was the boers, and the boers I mean this bloody apartheid sods, it was the SB threatening to bomb our home.   I was in the UK.  She fled the home unlocked, taking our dog with her.   We had to move her but fast from Lesotho.  While was I the UK I received a registered post, a letter purporting to come from the Lesotho Government, declaring me a prohibited immigrant.   And asking me not to return to Lesotho.   I was surprised because I had just got a new contract.   Through the ... (inaudible) ... we found out that it was a hoax, it was the South African Government or the regime doing this.   The Lesotho Government wanted me back immediately.   I was given 24 hours to leave Maseru In September of 1983.  The justice department was told, \"If Mrs Naidoo is not in the plane to Maputo at 7 am on Saturday, you will find a dead body\".   The government asked me to leave saying they could not protect me.   I just had a new contract with government and was reluctant to leave, but when my clients told me of the border problems, all the borders were closed, South Africa closed the borders, I was forced to change my mind.  South Africa refused oxygen for patients in the Queen II Hospital, patients were waiting in the theatre for oxygen and they wouldn't let the oxygen come in.  I had to leave.  Then the Maseru massacre I have described in the book that you have got, I would like you to look at some of these hair-raising pictures, especially these commissioners here.  I hope you will all have my book on the massacre.  I want to share with you the women who died there, despite the order not to kill women and children.   They, the SADF, explained it as cross-fire killings.  This commission should confront Constant Viljoen of Freedom Front fame who led the SADF into the cross-border raid in Lesotho.   He needs to talk with the families that he decimated on that night.   And there were all - they were all about, most of them in the Transkei area.  And of course the little children that he killed.   And you will see in this book what happened to our money.  He stole our money, they stole money of ours, we had over R68 000,00 somebody said, but certainly over R60 000,00 was in a mielie bag in Gase's home ... (inaudible) ...   That money wasn't there after they went.   In Sydney Magandela's house, SACTU money, couple of thousands were there.   They have to tell us what happened.   You see, if police use 10 bullets, they have to go to their commander to account for the bullets.   What was the report that came from the SADF raid, how many bullets were used?   We need to know all these things.   Then lastly, the murder of my son, Sargan(?).  My son born in 1961, I think you can read this for yourself.   Do you want me to read it?   (Pause)  My son Sargan was born on the 4th of April 1961.   Together with his colleague, Moss, were employed on the ANC farm at Chongela(?), near Lusaka in Zambia.  Sargan was the manager and Moss a senior mechanic.  Both were assassinated by Tex, on the night of the 15th of April 1989, 11 days after Sargan's 28th birthday.   Tex from Brits was found at Livingstone by the Zambian Police.   He being the first South African to arrive at Livingstone the Zambian Police were suspicious.  Most refugees came via Swaziland and Botswana at that time.   They duly informed the ANC, who interviewed Tex, he confessed that he was brought by Paulos from Com... (inaudible) ... building in Pretoria via Rhodesia.   His orders would come later after his military training.   I have read Tex' statement given to his interrogators.   No one in the ANC found it strange that he was the only survivor after a Unita ambush.  He was badly wounded and he needed to be hospitalized.   Later he was sent to Hungary and then the GDR, East Germany, for treatment.   When he returned he was sent to the ANC farm, where he would have plenty of green vegetables and fresh milk.   How well we took care of this agent.  Two days after the assassination, he was arrested and charged with murder.   He died from AIDS before the trial commenced.  No post-mortem was held to test the voracity of AIDS.   Sargan was interviewed on BBC about the farm in 1988.   We all heard it.   My sister in Senegal heard it.   Following this interview, Pik Botha in parliament attacked my son, saying he was not the manager of the farm, but the commander of our military stores.  Subsequently European parliamentarians looked the farm over and Sargan invited them to look for the military hardware.   They did not find anything.  Who ordered the killing of my son and Moss?   Two senior comrades responsible for feeding the ANC in Zambia and Angola, and at times Zimbabwe.   Where did Pik Botha get his information?   Did he order the killing of my son?   If he confesses to this, I would like to speak to him to tell him about the terrorists he killed, the so-called terrorists he killed.   When I asked Sargan in Hungary in 1979, 18 years, why he had chosen when he was 18 years, why he had chosen agriculture, we could not grow a potted plant in our flat I reminded him, \"What does South Africa need most, Mum?\" he asked, \"Food, Mum, food\", he said. \"We must feed our people, we cannot build a new South Africa on a empty stomach\".   What can I tell mothers who lose their children.   To compound my pain I have recently lost my second son, Shah, through a medical accident.   It is cruel and internal pain.   Both my sons have contributed their youth and their lives to the struggle for freedom.  Yes, I am very proud.   It is a painful, very painful pride.

And the sadness is that in this particular province, the violence still continues.  And women still bear the effect of that violence.   The women who have come here today have come here very - with so much humility and with so much strength, that they put some of us to shame and all we can say is that the experience has been a very very moving one.   And it is on this kind of story that we have built South Africa.  It was yesterday's todays which have made the future we have today and we remember those who did not come back, those who have died, and those whose stories have not, in fact, been told.   Many people thought the Spuiker van Wyk's, the General van den Berg's, they never thought that this day would come when they might have to be accountable for what they have done.   The day has arrived, and the time is now for them to come forward.  And if they don't do it, someone else will come forward to tell the story of what they have done.   We would like to thank all of you who have shared this day with us.  We know it has been a long one, but we are very grateful for it and very humbled.  We thank you for having participated in it with us, and for all those who have contributed to making it happen.   We now end this session of the special hearing on women, and we would like to call upon those women who have not yet come forward to do so, and we remember those who have died and we would ask you to observe a special moment of silence before we end the day's proceedings.\n/TRANSCRIBER'S",
