            "In 1982 the police use to come to my house threatening my younger boy until I asked the relatives to take care of him.  They use to come day and night looking for him and I asked them where are they taking him to and they told me he is attending COSAS meetings.  In 1982 I use to work night shifts.  In the morning when I came back I asked his brother Lucky and he told me that Lucky went to Johannesburg to a meeting and we were surprised that they did not come back.  While we were sitting the police use to\nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 M M NDEBELE\ncome and ask him for Lucky and they said I must tell them the truth and tell them where my son was.  I told them that I was also looking for my son and I did not know where he was.  \n After a while in 1986 I received a telegram from Lusaka.  Alfred Nzo had signed the telegram telling me that Lucky died in a car accident.  We were very shocked by that and there was another boy who was from COSAS.  He took the telegram with me to town.  I do not remember the place.  They took me to that office.  When we arrived there and they told us that they will investigate about his death and told me to go home.  I went home and Solomon Ngwashini took the telegram the next day and he said he was taking it to Priscilla Jana in Johannesburg so that she can investigate.  I waited for him.  When he came back I asked how it went and he told me that they said they will investigate further.  \n I waited until the other guys who went into exile, Stanley and Elias, came back.  I asked why are they back safe and they told me that Lucky died in exile.  When I asked them what killed him they told me that it was a hand grenade, but I was surprised that the telegram told me that he died because of the accident.  Those guys told me that they were together with him when he died and they said he was an instructor and he was killed by a hand grenade and he was buried there.  \n I now ask the Truth Commission to help me at least find the remains of Lucky, my son, so that I can bury him.  Now I cannot see, I am blind.",

To see whether he could be brought back, that will also be referred to the necessary channels.  We will in due  course be communicating with you again.  It will not be too soon.
