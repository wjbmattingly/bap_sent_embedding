            "On the 21st in 1985 we the residents of Mamelodi went to a meeting of the City Council.  When we had this meeting we heard about the rent problems.  We were\nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 P LERUTLA\ngoing there to listen to our leaders regarding this rent problem and there someone came up who told us that we had to disperse within five minutes.  At that time helicopters were flying around above us before this five minutes had elapsed and they started shooting.  When the shooting went on, a teargas was shot besides me.  Thereafter I was very wet on my skirt and when I looked up I saw it was blood and I could not walk at that time.  \n Then I crawled to the office.  There were people who I asked to wipe the blood from me and they did exactly that and bandaged my leg.  Thereafter they took me home.  After taking me home they asked me to put off the clothes I was wearing because they were full of blood.  Thereafter they took me to Mamelodi Hospital.  At Mamelodi Hospital we were admitted because there were some people who were injured and they transferred us to Kalafong and we were operated there.  After being operated we went to sleep.  After sleeping on the following day the doctors asked me and they said to me you must be aware that you have a bullet in your left leg.  What you must know is that we are not able to remove that bullet because where the bullet is situated, it is situated between a bone and a muscle.  Even at present the bullet is still in my leg.  I have been attending medical treatment up until I gave up.  \n Thereafter I could feel that this leg had started paining.  Especially after walking for a long distance this leg really gives me problems.  Even at work I still struggle with this leg.  The problem of this leg is what gives me the most worry because I do not how long will I be able to walk with this bullet in my leg.  Sometimes I sit down because of this pain and ask myself what is going to happen to me as \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 P LERUTLA\ntime goes on.  I do not know where I am going to end up with this bullet in my leg.  I end up thinking that I am going to end up being paralysed and I do not know what is going to happen to me as time goes on.",
