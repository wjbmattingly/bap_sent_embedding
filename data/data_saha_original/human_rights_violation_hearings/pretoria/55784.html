<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> Yes, I can hear them</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Yes.  We are very pleased that you have been able to come.  You are going to tell us about an incident again in 1986, ten years ago, which resulted in you losing, well resulted in the bombing of your house and we would like to ask you to tell us in your own words and your own time, tell us that story.  Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>2 S M BALOYI</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> In 1986 on the 11th it was at about one o' clock when I came back from work I sat in the house.  Whilst there it was time to go to sleep.  Whilst I was sleeping my husband came in and said to me it seems as if the police are bombing are houses nowadays ... I saw some fire and the house was burning and I was also burning at that time.  The people, my neighbours came to keep out of the fire and they took me to the hospital.  When I asked who had burned my house they said it was the police because everytime we were at home they would ask me where my son is and I would say to them he is around and they said they wanted him.  When I asked them why they said we know, you do not know why we want him.  Then I went to sleep at the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a> Whilst there I was discharged.  On the day I was discharged they came again, that is the police, and they said they were looking for Stanley and I said he is not here.  They said the saw him, he is in the house.  I was by that time still ill and this white man said to me, we saw him, you have given him a hiding place.  I said to them, no, I have not, you can see I am from the hospital.  They looked into the house because they said he was hiding in the house and they found him and they asked him, are you Stanley and he said, yes, I am Stanley.  They asked him why are you telling the newspapers that we are the ones who bombed your house.  I was still ill by that time.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a> We received a letter from the hospital and it informed me that I have to pay R900,00 and I could not do that because I am not the one who has burnt myself.  I do not know who burnt me and we left with my husband for the hospital and when we arrived there I asked the Superintendent and I said to him, I am not able to pay this </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>PRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>3 S M BALOYI</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>R900,00 because God did not cause this illness of me.  I was injured by the police.  That is where the Superintendent wrote me a letter and I went to the police station with my husband and we gave the police this letter from the hospital.  They wrote another letter after reading the one we gave them and they asked me to send it to the Superintendent at the hospital.  When I got there the Superintendent said to me you can go away and not pay anymore and that is when I went home.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Thank you Mrs Baloyi.  If I could just ask one or two questions to give us a clearer idea of what, a clearer idea of what happened.  This was in April 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> April, yes.  Could you tell us a bit more about Stanley?  How old was he at the time, your son?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> I cannot remember how old he was by then, but he was already a grown-up, that is a man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And you have told us about how the police use to come to your house and harass you because of his activities.  Could you tell us more about his activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> Stanley was not a thief, he was a Comrade and they did arrest him at once and send him to jail.  Whilst we were still wondering why he told us that he was bailed out by the Comrades and he had been discharged.  He did not tell us anything about his whereabouts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And being a Comrade he was then a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> Yes, he use to be in the company of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Did he discuss this with you at all because in 1986 the ANC would still have been banned, would it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> When they had meetings we use to see through</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>PRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>4 S M BALOYI</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>the clothes he wear when he went to these meetings that he was an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Then if I could come back to the night that this horrible incident happened to you.  Was he in the house at the time?  Was he staying with you then or had he gone away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> He was still staying with us.  That is on the day they came to bomb our house.  He did not tell us, but in our street he caught some boys and said they must look out for the police because they were coming to bomb our house and they did guard, but when the bomb was thrown at our house, when they came out of house number three, the police cars had already driven away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Your house is number seven.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> No, my house number is number nine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> But Stanley was at a different house that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> Yes, they were in house number 13.  That is where they were on the lookout for the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> So he felt that there was going to be an attack.  Did he say anything to you or your husband about the possibility of the attack?  Do you think that is why your husband ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> No, he did not tell us anything.  He only told the neighbours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> But do you think that is why, perhaps, your husband put up, ask to put up the blankets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> No, he was from he use to hang out with his friends.  They use to say that where a Comrade resided the police will visit.  That is what the people use to say at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Can you also tell us, this might be difficult because you were asleep and you woke up in flames, but you</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>PRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>5 S M BALOYI</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>can tell us what the bomb was?  What do you think it was?  Was it, what did it look like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> When I came from the hospital I saw a bottle at home.  It had a petrol bomb inside and sand inside in and a  little bit of powder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And what I am asking is do you think it looked, was it professional?  Who had made it, do you think?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> I do not know because I carry no knowledge of these explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And could I ask what this did for you?  You were very badly burnt which is why you were taken to hospital.  If you could describe your injuries and your husband's injuries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> Our beds were destroyed, our windows were destroyed on our clothes and I suffered burnings and my husband also suffered burnings.  The smell of the petrol bomb took about four months in my nose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And then what was the effect on your husband because he died subsequently, did he not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> No, he did not die immediately, but after we were bombed he started being ill.  We do not know whether the bombing was the cause or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Can you describe the illness to us please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> His illness was only to cough from time to time, but it was not TB.  They said that he had a problem of diabetes at the hospital, but after we suffered this ordeal it became worse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Just one last question Mrs Baloyi.  Could I ask you, you mention having made a statement at the Atteridgeville Police Station.  What happened after that?  Was there any follow-up at all, ever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>PRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>6 S M BALOYI</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> No, they never came to me.  Since we made the statement no one has contacted us, but when I told them that I must pay R100,00 at the hospital they wrote back the letter to the Hospital Superintendent and removed this debt.  That is what made me believe that is was they who caused this thing to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Thanks very much Mrs Baloyi, I will pass you back to the Chair.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any other questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Russell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Mama Baloyi, you say that the police were bombing houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Was, could you just tell us a bit about that?  Were there many houses being bombed during this time and how can you be sure that it was the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> We were three who went to the hospital and we were discharged on one day or we were admitted in one day.  The bomb exploded in Moeraring Street and they went to Fendanie.  At the hospital we were sleeping in the same ward and that is where we talked about these things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Now in Saulsville in this period 1985, 1986 there was a lot of political activity taking place.  Was this political activity just between the police and the community or were there other aspects to this conflict?  Was there conflict within the community itself, maybe, also during this time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> I do not know because I was not moving around a lot.  What I did was to live from home to work and from work I would go to Church.  I did not know what was</p>

<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Mrs Baloyi, may I ask a few questions about your circumstance at the moment.  Your husband has died, how many children do you still have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> I have nine children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> And are they looking after you?  Are they able to look after you or do you still have to work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALOYI:</span> I have to work, I cannot even wash my clothes and my shoulders are very painful at the moment.  I cannot do anything for myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Thank you and a last question.  After the whole sad incident did you receive any compensation from anybody apart from the R100,00?</p>
