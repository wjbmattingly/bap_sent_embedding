That was during the disturbances amongst, especially, the students when Afrikaans was brought as a medium of tuition and the protest demonstrations that flowed from that.  The police reacted using teargas, even firing into crowds, killing and injuring school children.  The chain reaction that followed again with arson attacks, baton charges against the kids, car stoning, barricading in the townships, raids and that eventually led to the broader revolt, a revolt that spread over the country.  It is against that background that Mrs Phalatse will be giving her evidence and I will appreciate it if, Mrs Phalatse, if you will tell us your story in your own way.",

            "It was in 1976, August, probably the 21st of August.  I was on my way to work.  When I knocked off at half past four I went to the train at Hartebees Station.\nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 W PHALATSE\nWhen I arrived home I met Irene's brother with her friend.  I asked them where they were going.  They said they were sent here by a teacher to come and call you from work.  I did not feel disturbed at that time.  Then I asked them where she is?  The said she is at hospital.  The train arrived for Atteridgeville.  I had just alighted from the one from Mamelodi then we boarded this one for Atteridgeville.  I said to them I will alight here at Kalafong and look for Irene.  I thought it was just a minor issue.  \n Then I alighted at Kalafong.  They were together with me to accompany me.  When we arrived there she was in Ward 9.  She had already undergone an operation, but they could not assist her immediately with the wounds that she received.  They took her out of the ward and to the Intensive Care Unit.  At the Intensive Care Unit she stayed there for some days and then she was brought back to the ward again.  She was a little better then.  She stayed at the ward for about 14 days, but however, in September she passed away.  \n After we have buried Irene we went to court.  We heard nothing at the court.  Hence, I found it useless that we attended the court.  The evidence that we received was a bit useless.  The last court hearing that we attended, which was the third one, they brought along white soldiers asking me are these the people who shot your child?  We said, we do not know because they shot from inside the Hippo.  I do not remember the names of that person who, Meintjies, they referred to him as Meintjies and he said I shot in, I fired in the air.  Then they started throwing stones at us.  Then they asked him did they hit you with the stones and then he\nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 W PHALATSE\njust pointed at his forehead. \n Now, Irene, when I went to school to enquire about Irene because the incident happened there within the school yard.  The teacher said I sent Irene to the library and I directed her how to get to the library and she must bring a book for me from the library.  As she went out the door, even before she reached the library she was shot.  The bullet did pierce her.  She left the school yard and then that is when I came there to ask them whether this Meintjies did shoot my child or not.  Then what they said was just to take her to the hospital.  All the teachers they were desperately trying to help the child and take her to the hospital.  It happened that they took her to Kalafong.  Then they operated on her, extracted the bullet after some days.  It was only then that they took her for an operation.\n However, the way she got shot she could not survive at all.  We went to court, but the evidence that we received there was of no use.  They said during riots you can claim nothing.  That is what they explained to us.  You do not have to put or lodge any claim if the incident occurred during riots.",
