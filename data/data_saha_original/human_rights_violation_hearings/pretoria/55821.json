In fact, 78 paragraphs, so we are very clear on what you want you to tell us, but we would be glad if you could stick to the essence of your story so that we can clearly hear what has happened, so that we can hear\nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 M J SHONGWE\nexactly what happened to you.

            "1990 In July a boy came to my house by the name of Sipho Zwane.  We were in the same street.  He is number nine and I am in number four.  He was looking for David and the kids told him that David was not around.  It was during the day.  He also came back again in the afternoon because David had gone to work.  When he came back in the afternoon David went to talk to him by the gate.  So they were talking outside, not inside the house, but outside by the gate.  I was looking through the dining room window.  When David came back inside the house I asked him how do you know this boy because this is such a horrible boy.  He said, no, there is something he wants from me and I asked what is it.  He said, no, do not worry because we did come into terms.  So we did not agree.  So he left, he went to the gym.  It was on Monday.\n On Tuesday he came back, the very same boy around the time when David was coming back from work and David went out.  When he got back to the house I said, David, today you are going to tell me the truth.  Why is it that you are so friendly to this boy because he is such a bad boy.  It is known, he is known to be a sell-out.  He said to me, no, he use to be an ANC, now he has left the ANC, he has joined Commons Party.  Now they are launching that party in Johannesburg so he has asked me to provide transport along to Johannesburg.  I asked where he is working?  He said Nampak.  Now what did you tell him. David said, no, told him that I am not going there, I am not providing any transport because when the police come they are definitely going to damage my car or even shoot all of us.  He refused. \n On Wednesday they very same boy came.  He told him \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 M J SHONGWE\nexactly what he told me.  When David came back inside the house I asked him what is it.  Then he told me that, no, they said they were going to give me R400,00.  This is so important, I must take them to Johannesburg.  When should you take them, on Thursday.  I said do not go there, it is dangerous.  You are going to get hurt and why does he want you.  Why can he not go to some other people who own combis.  He said, no, I do not know Mama.  I said be careful, choose your friends and you must be careful because we know that he is notorious.  \n He came back again at six a.m. on Thursday just before David left for work.  It was on the 26th.  He said to David we will give you now R800,00, can you please take us to Johannesburg.  David, where is the money, because they have seen that David was totally refusing to take them to Johannesburg.  Now the combi that we are talking about was used by Killer Maphosa at the time and David said probably I should go to Killer to tell Killer that I need to use the combi to take people to Johannesburg.  We will get R800,00 for that.  Well, they did agree and he took the combi.  He told Sipho it was fine, he will take them to Johannesburg and Sipho left.  In the afternoon when David came back David said, no, I am not even eating, I am not even taking my bread and tea.  I want to change quickly into my tracksuit and off I will go and David left.  While he was leaving I said, David, why are you going.  He said, Mama, I am in a hurry.  I asked did you agree with Killer?  He said, yes, and that was the last time I saw David.  \n He disappeared on the 26th of July.  He left David and he was, David left and he was not coming back.  We worried, what is happening.  It was now Friday, David is not coming \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 M J SHONGWE\nback.  I therefore left, I went to Sipho's place to ask Sipho's mum as to where David was or if they knew anything about David's disappearance.  When I got to Sipho's mum I greeted her.  I told her, you see, I am here, I am looking for my son and your son.  Where are they?  My son has not yet come back since then.  Then she said to me, well, I am not Sipho's shepherd if you care to know.  I said, now how can you say that?  She said, leave me alone, I am busy with my work.  I left her in peace.  It was on Friday.\n On Saturday I went back again.  You know this thing was pushing me because his football club members were also looking for him and Killer was there also looking for the, wanting the combi to use the combi.  I kept telling them, David is nowhere is to be found.  Now, I had to leave Killer in the house.  I went back to Sipho's mum.  I said, hey, Sipho's mum, you better tell me where my son is.  She said to me, you know just sit down, have a seat.  I am going to tell you something.  She took her cigarette and she was smoking suddenly and she said to me you know you must take some snuff and you go back home and take this snuff.  When you get home you must pray because the people who are with David are murderers, marauders.  They will kill him, but if you can talk to the ancestors and even your God, if you believe, David may be safe.  I said who are those people, who are those marauders?  She said, you know, those people are so bad.  You just better leave now because I am expecting some people here. I said, no, I am not going.  I am not leaving this house, I am not leaving you alone, you better tell me.  She said, no, just leave me alone, I am going outside now and one woman came in and said, you get out woman, I want to talk to this woman.  You give us some \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 M J SHONGWE\nspace.  She said to me you also, please leave us in peace.  Well, I had to leave there was no any other way.  \n I told Killer at home when I got there.  Killer said, but mum, do you believe this?  What is happening, that woman is insane.  Well, we sat down and we said what can we do because David has really disappeared.  We left, we went to some funeral of Mr Zwane.  In the very same street there was a funeral so we had to go and attend the funeral.  Just when we were at the funeral we got back.  I saw Sipho.  Sipho was there at the funeral.  You know, he was walking so pompously wearing new clothes.  You could see that he is walking so pompously.  He was just behaving so strange.  When I tried to approach him he just ignored me totally as if he did not know me whatsoever.  I left him alone.  \n After the funeral we went back to the house to wash up our hands. When I was looking at the back I just saw some boys and they were saying you know people are, have surrounded your house.  There are so many cars parked outside.  I quickly left.  I ran to my house. I met a kid, the kid was telling me, we are looking for you, go back home.  I said I am headed for home.  I found police there.  I did not know that those were police because they were not in uniform, they were in private clothes.  They were in short and in, you know, casual wear.  I asked them what do you want here?  They said where is your son, where is he?   We are looking for him.  I was surprised and astounded, what is happening here.  I told them also that I am also looking for David because he left on Thursday with Sipho, taking some people to the rally in Johannesburg.  Since then I have not seen Sipho.  They asked me did you report this to the police.  I said, yes, I have reported to every police \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n6 M J SHONGWE\nstation, but Sipho is nowhere to be found.  Can you please, gentlemen, also tell me where Sipho is.  \n I went to Sipho's mother and Sipho's mother also told me that David is not known where he is.  They were busy at the same time turning the house upside down, looking for things I did not know.  You know, when I asked what are you looking for, they said we are looking for David, your son, the one who has disappeared.  They left finally.  Around eight o' clock they came back, 12 in number.  They came back also.  They were perusing, searching in the house, turning my house upside down.  We could not sleep that day, they disturbed us.  We were so astounded, we were so surprised at to what was happening.  I do not know what has eaten up my child.",

            "We could not sleep that Saturday evening.  We could not even eat.  Even to this day, you know, his child always cried me, asking where is my father.  You know, it is sour, it is bitter in the house and we do not even know why we are crying.  Perhaps David is still alive, perhaps David is dead.  We would not know.  How can we know or probably he has left the country.  We do not know.  We are just devastated.  I therefore decided let me go to my aunty.  I left, I was headed for my aunties place.  You know, as if God was sending me, God was talking to me.  When I was with my aunty I told her that, you know, my child went missing. She said, where you think he has gone to.  I told her he left on Thursday.  There were three of us, it was myself, my aunty and her daughter.  I just greeted a boy outside. The boy was outside and I went on, proceeded into the house.  We PRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n7 M J SHONGWE\nwere talking with my aunty.  My aunty said, Mary just keep praying, God is going to answer your prayers, but I could tell that she was looking at me so timidly.  She was shy also, she could not look at me straight.  You know, I could feel some strange feelings sitting with them as we were talking.\n The boy that I left outside came into the house.  He came and stood by the door.  When he came I could see him signing to my aunty to keep quiet.  Now suddenly it was quiet.  There was quietness in the room.  I said to my aunty, well I am going now, I am leaving.  She took me out, she escorted me outside and she said you must go so well and God be with you.",

            "As I was still astounded the police came and took me, told me that there was a combi accident in town.  So you please come and see if you can see your child somewhere.  I said to them how can you ask me that, why do you want to take me with because you have your pictures, you have his pictures and also you have everything in records and you every single information, but they insisted, they were adamant.  They said please come along.  I left with them.\n On the road I was thinking, I was even saying, you know, I do not even trust these people because that is just how my son disappeared.  I told this man that, you know, I have a heart attack and if we get to the scene of the accident I might even collapse, you might be facing problems. Please let us go and get another person to accompany me.  They kept, the other one said, no, Captain Bard we shall bring you and you alone.  I said, no, I am going to collapse, I can be sure and certain of that. They were adamant and I was also insisting that, no, let us go back and get someone to accompany me.  \n We went to Killer.  Killer, the owner of the combi and Killer woke up and we took him with.  When we were supposed to be headed for town, as they have said the combi, the accident was in town.  Instead our direction was going to Britz.  I was surprised.  I said why are we going to Britz?  They said because you said you have a heart attack, we are taking you to Britz.  They said you shut up woman.  They \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n9 M J SHONGWE\ntook a lamp, a lamp, they said to me you shut up, you better keep quiet because we know where we are going.  The car was rushing and when we got there, when we got to the place, the destination, some policemen came inside and they were saying why did you bring this woman so quick.  The other black police said you said we must be snappy, we must be fast in everything that we do.  So we had to be snappy, we had to do everything quick, quick.  They were busy having altercations at the same time among themselves and also screaming at one another.  \n One man asked is there any mortuary around.  The other answered, no there is no mortuary and that, but you know what, I was told that, the other man said I was told that David has died and he was killed in Britz.  When they gave me some, a blanket wrapping, a corpse and I was like, what is happening.  Do you want to tell me that David has died and the room was filled with many people, hefty men, both black and white.  They took me with and we went to the mortuary and we got there.  After half an hour they got back and they sent one black guy to come call me so I can also go into the mortuary.  They said, no, only the woman must, is allowed inside.  Killer must be left outside.  Then I said, no, I want Killer to come with me inside.  \n The man went back to tell them that she, I am insisting to come in with Killer.  When we got inside, eventually they allowed us.  We could see the corpse on top of the table.  You know, they made things in such a way that I should think that the corpse was from the mortuary, was already in the mortuary.  They said to me you open the blanket, that blanket, blanket that was covering the corpse.  They said you look at this corpse.  I opened it and I said, no, but \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n10 M J SHONGWE\nthis is not my son.  They said, but this is your son.  Just concentrate, are you sure, look properly.  I did exactly that.  What I discovered that there was a zip in the, and I tried to open this zip.  You know, I could identify this corpse. I could not tell that this is my child.  The way he was so brutally injured and the way they have fatally injured him.  I pulled down the zip to look at the whole body of this corpse.  This white policeman refused, he refused for me to open up the zip all the way down.  He said, you know, you have already seen and you are already sure that this is your son.  So there is no point in opening the zip all the way down.  \n I insisted, I opened the whole zip.  I discovered that there was, they had stuffed some things in front of him and he had no underpants on.  They had just covered him with some cloth.  I screamed, I cried and I collapsed.  When I regained my consciousness I was right next to Killer.  Killer, and suddenly a doctor came in and the doctor said to me, you know, he held my head way up to my knees and after that he said I am just playing around with them, I do not have heart attack at all.  One suggested that we must get an ambulance and take me to the hospital.  I refused, I said I am not going to the hospital.  You killers, you marauders, you murderers, you have killed my son and I am not going to that hospital.  I refuse, I do not want to be taken anywhere else.  You have killed my son, you know better.  This, my son, was killed in Pretoria and you are just framing up a story here.  They said, you shut up, you think you know so much, you think you are better and I collapsed instantly.  \n I was taken into a car, into a black car, to a car with black people inside.  We did not go back to Pretoria with \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n11 M J SHONGWE\nthe same route we used going into Britz. We took another route, a different one.  Inside the car I kept asking this black man, tell me, truly, what has happened.  Where did you recover that corpse.  They said you have already, you also saw.  There is nothing we can tell you and we went to Compol in Pretoria Street.  \n When we got to Compol we went into the lifts way up the stairs and there was a bad room that we got into.  It was so dark you could not see and recognise anything.  We could just see some red lights, on the tables there was just some strings hanging and red globes.  They said to me we want you to sign. They gave me a form to sign, you know, that paper had nothing on it.  They said you better sign on this paper.  I said why should I sign, why and why.  They said, no, you are signing so we can be able to give you some funds to bury your son and also we will support you and your family and take care of you.  I asked them just like, whenever did you try and do that.  Whenever did you try to be so kind.  Why would you want to be that kind to me.  They said, no, you know at times we are like that although people mistake us to be so evil.\n On that very Saturday or that happened on that very Saturday and we inside that room, dark as it was, I was asking Killer, Killer why do you think this is going on and on.  Killer said, you know what, I think you must be quiet now. Just keep quiet because they are going to keep you, they are going to kill you now if you keep asking questions.  Well, I said, okay Killer, I will take your advice, I will be quiet and I just shut up.  They said to, they came back again in the room.  They said you now have to keep quiet about this.  What you have seen and witnessed, you must keep PRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n12 M J SHONGWE\nquiet about it, you must not tell any person that also how brutally he was injured and killed.  You have a big mouth, you must try to keep your mouth shut because that will be detrimental to you if you talk anything.  \n We were taken back home and at home they asked me what did you see.  I kept quiet since I was warned to keep quiet because if I say anything that will be detrimental to me.  In the afternoon that day there was a TV, we were turning on the TV and we saw something that was astounding and we were like, what it is that they are saying.  They say a corpse was discovered in Britz and it is not known who the killer, the marauders were.  We cried and some Comrades came in to ask what has happened.  We have seen on the TV what has happened.  \n On Monday morning I went to the police.  When they came into the house they could not see us.  They got so mad for the fact that they could not find us home.  You know, every now and again they could come into my house.  So many cars would be parked outside as if they were running after some animal of some kind.  When we went with Killer to the attorney in town I said to them, you know, I have seen a lawyer of the Human Rights, let us go there.  They refused, they said, no, we have our own lawyer, let us go to our own lawyer.  I do not know whom they have sent there, you know, to trap us or something because we are always under surveillance.  They knew every single action that we were doing.  My girl said she saw a white man fidgeting with the telephone receiver as is there was something they were putting inside the telephone.  \n We went to the lawyer to give statements and also what we have witnessed.  They were there.  There, you know, I was PRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n13 M J SHONGWE\nlike a bunny of some kind, an animal because they were always running after me.  You know, we each, at times I would even try to hide and they will just pass not seeing me where I have hidden.  That was the kind of life I was under those days.  People would ask me what is happening, you keep running and so forth.  I said, well, that is the kind of life I am leading now. We eventually went to the lawyer and the lawyer also came outside and told me that, you know, someone broke into my office as well.  I think this statement of David's must be kept under serious conditions because they are looking for this statement.  \n When we were looking opposite of the lawyer's office there was a parking space for the vehicle.  We could see them in that parking area, parking lot looking direct to the office of the attorney.  You see they could not see us inside the office, but we could see them outside.  One of them ...",
