            "Benjamin Maifadi was at home.  That is where I was born and is where I was married.  He went to visit his grandmother for a couple of days.  There was a time when people came and told us that the children have gone to KwaNdebele and we asked how could we get to KwaNdebele and where in KwaNdebele are the children.  There was this other person who told us that, who asked us how are we going to get to KwaNdebele because the people there are witches.  There is the Mbokodo there and you will not be able to reach the place.  We could not do anything at that time until we were told that the children had died in KwaNdebele.  Then when we heard that the children had been killed in KwaNdebele, on the very same night that they told us that the children were killed in KwaNdebele my son's father went away to KwaNdebele on the very same night.\n When he got to the Government Mortuary they sent him away.  They said he cannot enter the Government at that time of night.  Then he met all the parents of the other children who were killed there.  On the following day we went to KwaNdebele, but what hurts us most is that the very same combi that took us, took them to KwaNdebele.  It is the very same combi that took the children to KwaNdebele also, as we came to know later.  They said that these children were at Sis Johannah's house and Sister Johannah is my neighbour.  She knows me, she knows the child's father and she knows all the parents of these children who died.  This hurt us very \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 S MAIFADI\nbad because we could not think that a person like Johannah could keep our children up until this thing happened.  Why did she not tell us because she knew at that time there were uprisings?  How did it come about that she kept our children until this incident happened to them?  That is why we do not sympathise for her because she knew or she knows what happened to our children.  \n When the rumours came around her child who was sitting here, when we were still preparing for the funeral, her child came to the, my house's gate and she said, your children was killed last and I said to her, your house is still safe and you still have your parent's possession with you.  She said the problem is that these children have been killed, that is the main problem.  After days went by the very same people came to us and organised a combi for us so that we could go to Klipgat because our children had not been killed.  They have been kidnapped so there is a traditional doctor in Klipgat who would resurrect the children who had been killed or who are dead.  We went there because we wanted to find our child not thinking that these people were turning us into stupids.  We went with them there and we went to this traditional doctor.\n When we got there this traditional doctor gave us water.  After drinking water we were told that our children were in the cave.  So we had to pay that traditional doctor something like R60,00 per month and from there if these children come out of the cave you must bring me a cow and I will give your children and please send them their clothes and everything that they need.  When we left that place we asked ourselves whether she ever resurrected any person and then we could not find an answer and we never went back to \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 S MAIFADI\nthis traditional doctor.",

The other thing is we are still investigating, trying to find the truth about the whole event that you are telling us about.  I do not know if you had seen in the newspapers that a lawyer wrote to us, writing on behalf of the police, that is 22 officers, some of them were Generals and some of them the leaders in the police, trying to inform us that those people who were\nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n6 S MAIFADI\nconsidering coming to plead for amnesty from the Commission and the very same person gave the names of those people who wanted amnesty and on the other side of the letter they included the many events in which these police would accept or acknowledge that some of the things that are written, they were perpetrated by them or they know about those incidents.  Like the incidents at Khotso House.  People use to think that it was a certain lady who planted a bomb at Khotso House.  Now this lawyer said, no, this event or incidents like the one at Khotso House, they admit that they are the ones who had a hand or who perpetrated these incidence.  One of them being the massacre at KwaNdebele.  That is the one we are addressing today.  \n We have not looked in details in what they told us, but there is no one who could just, from the blue, stand up and say that I take responsibility for doing this and this unless he did it.  Maybe the pain you went through thinking that it is a certain person who did this, maybe if we tell you the truth and you know who really perpetrated this incident, maybe you can be emotionally healed.  We have not emphasised that it is the police who did this, but they are the ones who approached us and told us that they are the ones who perpetrated this.  All the time we use to think that it was the ANC who perpetrated this incident, but later on they came and told us that they are the ones who did perpetrated this incident.  \n This Commission is called the Truth and Reconciliation Commission so we want to establish what is the truth about all these incidences.  The other side of this Commission is that it administers reconciliation and we are trying to heal all the wounds of the past.  We also hope that you, as you \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n7 S MAIFADI\nhave said, that by coming here, probably you will be healing old wounds.  That will exactly happen.  \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG",
