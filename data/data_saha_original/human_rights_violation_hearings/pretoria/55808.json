            "The honourable panel, on this day when this fateful thing happened to me, my son had gone to a night\nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 P MOIMA\nvigil the night before. On the day of the funeral he also attended the funeral.  When he went to the funeral me and his grandfather sat on the steps.  Whilst we were sitting there, and because we had problems from the police, who used to kill our children.  I was staying with my husband at home by then while they were at the funeral.  Whilst I was there I was worried will these children come back alive. \n Whilst we were still sitting there, a Kombi came by and it came to my house.  It was a boy and a girl and they found me together with my husband.  They told me George had been shot.  I left with my husband to see what was happening. When we arrived there we found many policemen, and we wanted to see what was happening.  They stopped us from getting to the scene. I asked them why don't you want us to see what is happening.  This child's uncle was also bleeding by that time.  Then I asked the police are you also trying to kill the uncle, because you have killed the cousin.\n Then we waited for the ambulance and when I looked at George I tried to wake him up. I found out that he had been shot on his forehead.  The ambulance came and they took him away. I also went with him in the ambulance. My husband didn't get in the ambulance he went on foot to Kalafong Hospital.   When we got there at the hospital, he had a mask on his face.  They sent him to a doctor but the female doctor said to us they had sent him to the X-ray to examine the injuries.  When we got to see him at the X-ray department the female doctor came to me, they came back with George.  When I looked at George I could see that he was shot on the forehead.  The doctor said to me - it was a female doctor, she said he had been shot with six bullets in his head, which have destroyed his brain.  That is why there PRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 P MOIMA\nwas no life in him any more.\n Then we went back home with my husband and that is where we had problems.  We are going to have a lot of problems during the night vigil. I also want to thank God for having helped other children who had come to me, to send our condolences whilst there were Hippos at my house.  \n These people also attacked me with sjamboks and I ran away.  These other boys and girls, even my chimney had holes in it because there were many bullets that were fired at my house.  But God helped me at that time.  The other children who came to me to bring condolences, I want to thank them.   I thought that we are going to have problems with the burial of my child.  When that time came the Hippos were there during the funeral.  We were about to bury my son at Attridgeville together with the other one who had passed away. They said no, you don't have to bury him at Attridgeville, you are goin gto bury him at Saltsville. I had paid for the grave at Attridgeville, but the body was buried at Saltsville.\n Today I can say that the police are my enemies.  I don't even like them today. I am going to hate them until I die because even when we went to them for help they didn't help us.  \n George wasn't troublesome.  He used to be at home most of the times. He used to take care of the garden and he didn't roam the streets.  I wish that God can help the Commission to continue with their work to reveal the truth, all the secrets must come to the fore, and may God help you to continue with your work, and strengthen you.  Thank you.",
