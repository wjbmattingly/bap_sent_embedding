            "On the 18th of March in 1986 my sister-in-law called my husband and advised him that there were people looking for him.  Two weeks later I received a letter which was addressed to my sister-in-law.  It was a letter written\nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 C Q KENNY\nin husband's handwriting.  In there he instructed two men to come and collect some of his clothing.  These two men came to fetch the clothes and they also asked for accommodation.  Three days later they left.  Since then I have never ever heard from my husband again.  \n I started looking for my husband.  I went to various hospitals, to various police stations and to various mortuaries.  However, all of these searches were fruitless.  At the time of my husband's disappearance we were married for three years.  We were very close.  I have never ever received any money from his previous employers.  He worked at Siemens.  \n Nine years later on the fifth of August in 1995 a policeman from the Department of Justice came to my home.  At the time I lived with my sister.  They then advised me that they suspected that my husband died nine years ago.  I then had to visit the Department of Justice.  They requested me to make a statement.  One of the men who I accommodated at that time I recognised on that day.  I immediately recognised him when I saw him.  I had so many questions and he said that he was sorry and that he, in fact, was one of the policeman connected to Vlakplaas and that he regrets it and that he dearly regrets what he did to his own people.  He also advised me that the last time he saw my husband was at Vlakplaas and he said that when he later enquired from other policeman they said that he was involved in a bomb explosion and that is how he met his death.  \n I very much would like to provide my husband with a decent funeral.  The police advised me that they are still awaiting on a reply from the Police General, but up until now I have still not heard anything from them.  I feel that \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 C Q KENNY\nthose policemen involved in my husband's killing should be prosecuted.  I am not even able to acquire a home of my own.  I am still struggling to come to terms with everything.  My son is now 11 years old.  I would very much like this matter to be investigated.  My first question is when am I going to receive a death certificate?  I would like to receive his money from his previous work of employ or place of employ.  I would like the Commission to get behind the whole truth and to establish as to whether he is dead or not.",

Thank you very much.\n Has Mrs Maseku arrived?  No.  ... and we will be hearing testimony from people involved in the KwaNdebele \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n7 C Q KENNY\nincident.  People from Mamelodi who were shot and burnt in KwaNdebele.  Also people from the events in Mamelodi.  The deaths that occurred as a result of the march in Mamelodi.\n I think today was a particularly important hearing for the Commission because I think that today we got, not only a good picture of just how many sided the conflict was, we had people coming forward from the Church Street bombing.  So that perspective which contributes to a wider picture, but I think that today we have also, perhaps, had an opportunity to focus on another aspect of the work of the Truth Commission which we talk about a lot in theory, but I think today we actually saw a lot of that in practice from the testimony of the witnesses and some of the things that they were saying, the views that they were expressing and that is around the whole question of reconciliation.  I think it was very moving to hear from people like Mr Clarence, in particular, that they have come to terms with these, with the events of the past, with the conflicts, that they can understand the conditions, the context in which these events took place.  That they never ever want to forget which is certainly not what we in the Commission are proposing, but that they can understand and maybe even forgive if they can know more about the circumstances.  So I think that that aspect of the work of the Commission, the reconciliation aspect was highlighted today and I think that from the testimony of the witnesses, it was clear that they are not necessarily out for vengeance or for punishment or victimisation.  So we want to, again, express our appreciation to all the witnesses who came forward and people who spoke on things which were very painful and painful reminders for us as well, I suppose, of the past \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n8 C Q KENNY\nthat we have just come through.  I thank the audience again and those who came to show support, family and hope that as many of you will come again tomorrow and on Thursday when we have the final day of the hearings for now in Pretoria.  So thanks once again.  Go well.\n The Archbishop will be here tomorrow and will be chairing the session so we look forward to welcoming him as well.  Thank you.\nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG",
