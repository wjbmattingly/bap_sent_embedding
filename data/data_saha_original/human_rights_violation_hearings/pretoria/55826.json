            "My husband was a victim in the Church Street bombing as already mentioned earlier.  It happened in 1983.  As far as we know 19 people died and more than 200 people were injured.  My husband was seriously injured that night.  PRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 S L WALTERS\nWhen he by six o' clock that evening did not arrive home I started getting worried because he was a very conscientious person because he would have always advised me if or when he should have been late.  I then went to look for him.  We went to several hospitals that night.  In the end at around 11:30 that night we finally found him.  He was seriously injured.  He had multiple injuries, he had a broken arm and a broken leg, his face was severely burnt, he also had internal injuries and he was, of course, at that stage unconscious.  When I found him he had just come from an operation.  A week later on the 28th of May he died due to his injuries.  He died without ever regaining consciousness.  We were never able to communicate during this time.  \n For me and my children it was a very traumatic and very painful experience.  The experience to see my husband suffer so much.  At the time of husband's death my daughter Renata, who is with me, was in matric.  My son was in standard eight and my youngest daughter, Liezl, was only four years old then.  The tragic and sudden death of my husband drastically changed the life of me and my family.  Apart from having to assimilate this terror event, we also had to drastically change our way of living.  My husband was a family man and we all supported him and he supported us.  He had a very special relationship with his children.  We all leant very heavily to him.  He died at a time when his three children needed him and his guidance the most.  We have had to go without my husband's income.  I have had to go out and work.  I have had to put my youngest daughter in a creche.  A few months later the Principal of the creche called me and asked me if I would rather not remove her from the creche and look after myself as she suffered greatly and that her feeling at PRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 S L WALTERS\nthe time was that one of us might disappear.  My youngest daughter had to grow up without the presence of a father.  I then decided to stay home and I did freelance work in order to make ends meet.  The other two had to further their studies and I had to make provision for this.  \n Previously my husband was a Minister.  He served at various congregations.  At the time of his death he was busy with his doctorate in Communication.  I would just like to make mention of the fact that the true suffering that myself and my family have endured over the last 13 years can never ever be calculated.  I can only imagine how different my life would have been if my husband was still alive and even though the alleged bomb planters died in the event, I still feel that those, the masterminds behind this despicable deed, is still at large.  I therefore request the Commission to investigate this matter.  I would like the perpetrators to be brought to court.",

I would like to ask you are you, and I do not mean this in a bad way, are you able to, when you make mention of terror acts, are you able, not that I expect it from you, but I just want to know how do you feel at present?",
