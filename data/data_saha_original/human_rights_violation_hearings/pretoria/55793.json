In this event 19 people were injured and, 19 people died and 200 were injured.  At that stage I was married to him for 17 years.  We had two sons.  They were respectively 12 and 3 years old at the time.  My husband's death was a major shock due to the gruesomeness of the explosion.",

As a direct result of my husband's death my family life has been totally disrupted.  Since then I have suffered major depression as well as multiple sclerosis.  I still receive psychological and medical treatment and due to this I have been declared medically unfit and because of this have been dismissed from my place of employment.  My ill health after my husband's death also adversely affected my children's education.  They are unable to come to terms with the circumstances surrounding my husband's death.  I expect that PRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 E H F KLOK\nwhoever was responsible for the organisation and planning and doing of this deed should be brought to book.",

I know this is very difficult for you, but if you do not mind I would just like to ask you a few questions just to help us get a broader picture and to also give you a chance maybe to express your views on some of the work and the issues which are of concern to the Truth Commission.  You were not here earlier this morning because you had another appointment, but I did indicate that in the next week, beginning on Monday, there are going to be submissions by all the political parties to the Truth Commission.  The National Party, Pan Africanist Congress, the African National Congress and we are hoping that in those submissions the political parties will reveal some of their actions, the things they did, explain why they did it, take responsibility.  So on your, one of the requests that you have put to the Commission in your statement that you want this to be investigated with, in-depth by the Truth Commission.  We are hoping that in these submissions a lot of what, a lot of the questions which you want answered, will be answered, but we will in any event be carrying on with our investigations and trying to get as much of the truth as possible.  So that is one commitment that can be made.\n I wanted to ask you, we have had many people from, victims from the Church Street bombing come forward and speak about things that happened to them and also to family members, mothers.  In your statement you say that you regard what happened as \"'n uiters ernstige skending van menseregte\", as a serious and gross human rights violation \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 E H F KLOK\nthat can never ever be justified and I do not think that anyone will, necessarily, disagree with you, but is it possible, do you think, that this can be seen against the backdrop of the conflicts of the past and if never justified, at least we can get some understanding and maybe that we can learn some lessons from it?  I would like you to just give your honest feelings on that matter.",
