Whilst I was sleeping my husband came in and said to me it seems as if the police are bombing are houses nowadays ... I saw some fire and the house was burning and I was also burning at that time.  The people, my neighbours came to keep out of the fire and they took me to the hospital.  When I asked who had burned my house they said it was the police because everytime we were at home they would ask me where my son is and I would say to them he is around and they said they wanted him.  When I asked them why they said we know, you do not know why we want him.  Then I went to sleep at the hospital.\n Whilst there I was discharged.  On the day I was discharged they came again, that is the police, and they said they were looking for Stanley and I said he is not here.  They said the saw him, he is in the house.  I was by that time still ill and this white man said to me, we saw him, you have given him a hiding place.  I said to them, no, I have not, you can see I am from the hospital.  They looked into the house because they said he was hiding in the house and they found him and they asked him, are you Stanley and he said, yes, I am Stanley.  They asked him why are you telling the newspapers that we are the ones who bombed your house.  I was still ill by that time.  \n We received a letter from the hospital and it informed me that I have to pay R900,00 and I could not do that because I am not the one who has burnt myself.  I do not know who burnt me and we left with my husband for the hospital and when we arrived there I asked the Superintendent and I said to him, I am not able to pay this \nPRETORIA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 S M BALOYI\nR900,00 because God did not cause this illness of me.  I was injured by the police.  That is where the Superintendent wrote me a letter and I went to the police station with my husband and we gave the police this letter from the hospital.  They wrote another letter after reading the one we gave them and they asked me to send it to the Superintendent at the hospital.  When I got there the Superintendent said to me you can go away and not pay anymore and that is when I went home.",
