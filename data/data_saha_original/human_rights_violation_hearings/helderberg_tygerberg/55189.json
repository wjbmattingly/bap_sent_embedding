            " Good before I ask you to tell us a little bit about yourself and then also to tell us about your daughter, I would like to just read some of the context statement that has been prepared by your research team so that we understand what the context was and - at the time of your daughter's shooting. On June the 17th 1980 violence broke out in the Coloured Townships of Elsies River and Lavender Hill during the commemorations of the June 16, 1976. Events reached their peak on the night of the 17th of June and the morning of the 18th of June 1980. A two day stayaway was held to commemorate the uprisings of 1976. Apparently the police detained Coloured leaders prior to the 16th and 17th of June in an effort to avoid violence as a result of the memorial activities. In addition the Government banned meetings and gatherings during this time. These actions by the Government may have contributed to the climate of disorganization and spontaneous gathering which led to the uprisings. At the time there were ongoing boycotts of Coloured schools protesting conditions of the schools as well as bus boycotts that was brought on by fare increase, busier increase. Incidents of arson, looting, plundering and general uprising market the events. There were some speculation about the involvement of gang members. Police action involved the use of tear gas, baton charge and live ammunition. Police declined to issue a casualty list, the total number of deaths recorded at 5 Peninsula hospitals was more that of - more than 42. Of those who died, 26 were identified by relatives, over 200 people were injured. A large number of woman, young and pregnant mothers and children were amongst the victims. According to newspaper reports, Johanna Moses, your daughter, was in Halt Road, Elsies River at about 800 pm on the 17th of June 1980. The witness might have made a mistake with the date, I wasn't meant to read that one, I am sorry. Shooting took place on the evening of the 17th and the morning of the 18th. Johanna was 18 years old and had a 2 year old son called Mark at the time of the incident.",

            "My daughter and a friend of hers left home, violence was taking place in Halt Road, the police were firing tear gas, there was stone throwing and there was a whole commotion. But they came around the other side of the flats and they were knitting doily's and they were on their way to another girl's house. Around about six o'clock or maybe quarter to six this other friend came to her and I asked Hester where is Johanna, and she said no I am also looking for her, I don't know. She and Hilda left here together, but there was such a violence and noise outside that one couldn't actually leave one's home, I was just standing on the stoep and look through the windows. The police were shooting, and then I went back into my house. Later on I was once again standing on my stoep and I saw them dragging my daughter from the corner up to Halt Road. And I then ran into the house and said to my husband they dragging Lucky to the corner, it seems to me as if she's been shot. The ambulance came and took her away to the hospital, I didn't have a phone at that stage, so I couldn't even phone the hospital it was too dangerous outside to actually go out. The next morning I went to my work, I worked at Tygerberg, and I spoke to my Matron and I told her that my daughter had been shot. We first had a look at the - in the trauma unit to see whether she was there, but she wasn't. My Matron took me into her office and said to me please sit down Ms Moses, and she asked for a cup of coffee for me and I said no I don't want any coffee. Afterwards she came back to me and gave me an injection, the doctor came and gave me an injection and they told me my daughter was in the Conradie Hospital and she died there, seven o'clock that morning. And I went home, she had a little boy of two years old. I can't remember how much later but there was an inquest and the Magistrate called me to the Court in Goodwood. And I wanted to talk and I wanted to say that she - she just left the house, then they silenced me and they gave me papers but I don't know much more. I then went home and we arranged a funeral and we buried her. She had a two year old boy and I had to care for him, and I got no support for his care.",
