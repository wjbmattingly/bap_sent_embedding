On the 29th of August well there were riots, on this particular day my daughter was still working, she had always worked. And on this particular day she was on her way back from work while it was still so active there, she was coming down the road and there were Casspirs riding in convoy down the road. And I still told them there at home that you people shouldn't go out to go and watch these things because you could get hurt. But then they said to me no they were going - they just wanted to look - they just wanted to see how these things looked and they then - when the Casspirs drove past they went out and they went to go and watch. And when they got outside to - in the street, the policemen started shooting tear gas. Half the people ran away, and they also ran away. But in the time it was so dark with this - with smoke and they started shooting bullets after that and the one bullet struck her. But we did not know then that she was - she had been shot and Dina Baron brought us her scarf and her shoes and told us that the children had been shot, her daughter as well. At the time we went to the police for information to find out if they hadn't been locked up or anything and we phoned the hospital, the hospital said that there were children, wounded children who were admitted. But at the time we didn't even think that she had been killed. My husband and a friend of his went to the hospital by car. At approximately 730 the Thursday evening she was shot, but it took so long before the ambulance was called and the ambulance arrived, that it was very dark by the time they came. My husband and then could only leave at about eleven o'clock because we were terrified. And when they got to the hospital they were told that one had died, so they should go to Salt River and then left and when they got there, they were shown her clothes. And I had already told him what she had on, so they showed him her clothes and he knew that she has been shot dead. And up until now nobody has come to us - none of the perpetrators have approached us. All we know is that our child has been shot dead and that we have buried her, and nothing has happened as far as this case is concerned.",

The worst of all was that nobody came to us to tell us that your child was there and I shot at her. Nobody did that, she was just shot and that was that. And that really hurt us. If they had injured her it probably wouldn't have been as painful as them having shot her dead. Today is the first time that I can actually talk about her, in almost eleven years but I am just grateful that I can just talk and I am so happy that there is a Truth Commission, I really want to thank you, for listening to this case and we decided, we had initially decided to just let it be, but we appreciate the fact that there are still people that care about us, for us people that suffered and our people - our loved ones that were killed.",
