I was not at home at home at the time of the incident but my daughter, the one who is present here with me to-day was also present.  I was first from another place where I was told that my son had been taken to the Bethal Hospital.  They fetched me on a Monday and I went straight to the Bethal hospital.  When I got to Bethal Hospital they told me that he had just been taken to Kalafong Hospital and I proceeded home thereafter.  When I got there I was told of the injuries that he had sustained.  We do not have any clarity as to who attacked him but my daughter Tembi said certain policemen came into the house as well as an ambulance and they knocked at my place.  They woke them up and instructed them to open the door but they were scared to open up because at that time there was a lot of violence going on.  A certain policeman identified himself as Mandla Nglabati and he said he had come to tell them that my son had been injured.  They went out to speak to him  -  that he was wearing and he had just arrived on that particular day because he was from work.  He was working in Pretoria.  On that Monday I was at home and on Wednesday I went to Kalafong Hospital to see him.  I didn't know where Kalafong was but I had to look for it until I got there.  When I got to Kalafong I was not able to identify him because he was at the intensive care unit.  There were drips around him and the nursing sister pointed him out to me and he could identify me by my voice.  His eyes had been gouged out as well as his teeth, all his teeth.  He had no teeth left in his mouth.",

I was not able to leave my son behind in that condition and I slept on the bench at Kalafong hospital so that I could see him the following day.  The following morning I went to wash my face in the toilets, the hospital toilets and I went to see him once more.  I tried to speak to him.  One eye gouged out and he could hear my voice.  He knew I was his mother and I was told to go to Pretoria.  I got to Ogies and came back this way again.  After a few days a certain policeman by the name of  Gramel came to me and told me that I should go to court on a certain day.  I wanted to find out from Gramel as to who opened up a case or who submitted a  statement with regard to my son's injuries but he could not answer me.  I asked, who injured my son ?  He told me it was a certain man by the name of July Mtetwa and I asked him where July was.  He said July was out on bail, on five hundred rands bail.  I don't have a clear recollection of the time that he stayed at the hospital.   I think it was either one and a half months or two months.   When he came back he submitted a statement himself.  Even though he submitted a statement the matter went no further.  After about a year had lapsed, it's only then that the matter proceeded to court and we came to Ermelo.  I accompanied him to Ermelo and the matter proceeded.  We were addressed by the Regional Magistrate.  I think what he said that I can really testify to having heard, he asked my son as to how he identified the attacker.  My son said, I identified him because he had hit me twice at the back of my head and he turned around and he held him and the Magistrate asked as to whether there was any form of light that enabled him to identify his attacker.  He said there was some form of light.  It was not totally dark and he could identify him as July.  Thereafter others came and they also attacked him.  That's when he lost consciousness and he could not identify the rest but he knew about July.  When he came to he crawled to a certain woman's house who was staying in Davela and the woman who held my son.  He called the neighbours and the neighbours helped.  The Magistrate proceeded to tell him that he was not able to positively identify his attacker.   I don't know who the Magistrate knew it.  I think she'll proceed to say what happened thereafter.",

I went to identify him when he was in the ambulance and when I looked at him his whole left side had been blown up.  Thereafter police came and told us that July had been arrested.  I asked them how they knew that July is the one that attacked my brother but they could not furnish me with a satisfactory answer.  When he came back his jaws were in wires and we asked what was happening.  They said they were trying to fix his left eye.  He asked us to close him or try to close his eye injuries.

You have seen him through the effects of the attack.  You've seen him in hospital.  You've been through the court case where the person you think was responsible for the attack on him, is let free.  You've seen him being disabled and now more recently you've seen him die.  Again there's very little that we can do to lessen that.  What we can do is to try through the references that you have give, the case numbers, to see what can be done about possibly re-visiting the case or re-opening the case.  There is a report you talk about as well of a disability grant that is there and in offering our condolences and our sympathy I would just like to say that we will do what we can to follow this through.  It must be very difficult for you to have come to-day and we would like to say how grateful we are to you for that.  We share in you pain and give you what comfort we can through saying thank you very much for coming.  Thank you.",
