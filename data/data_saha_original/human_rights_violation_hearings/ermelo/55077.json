            "Bongani, good afternoon.  Welcome.  Bongani, we are moving away completely from what happened in Wesselton and in Kwadela.  We're moving to another part of our history in a sense, the history of forced removals and you as a young man becoming caught up as a victim because of the involvement of your father.  I know you're not coming to talk about your father but I would like to make that point.  Your father, as most people in this community would know and many parts of our country was a fighter for rural people and particularly for the community of Driefontein.  I have had the pleasure of going to your community many times myself so I know where Driefontein is.  It was after the death of your father that I started becoming involved there.  Your father in fact died two months after what happened to you.  You were a young man as I said at that time.  Schooling in Swaziland, coming back to visit your family and I want you please to now take us through what happened to you February 1983 and in a sense what we're going to be learning is how what appears to be just an attack on you by police officers, turns out to be much bigger than that.  So I give you your time, please be relaxed.  There's nothing to be frightened of.  Tell us what happened to you.",

            "It was on the twelfth of February, on a Saturday.  I came from Swaziland and I came to visit my parents.  Just when I got off the bus, there was an Indian area as well as a Boer area and I had gone to take a bus in the Indian area and I saw an E20 or Hi-Ace in which there was a person who was calling me, using a hand gesture.  When I got there, I saw eight men and showed me some identification.  They were policemen.  They wanted to search me because I had a handbag as well as a paper bag.  They searched through and they saw my written standard seven report from St. Joseph's School.  Previously a teacher had been kidnapped from my school and he was brought to Piet Retief.  He was kidnapped from Swaziland and brought to South Africa.  They asked whether I knew that person and I told them that I knew him.  They asked me what relationship I had with him.  I told them that it was a student teacher relationship.  They asked me what subject he was teaching me and they also asked me my surname.  I told them that I was from the Mkhize family and they asked me whether I knew Soul Mkhize.  I said yes, he's my father and they said Soul Mkhize thought that he was a clever man and at that time they were taking all the contents of my bag as well as the paper bag and pouring it onto the floor of the car.  They stated getting into the car.  We drove and went to Supermac in Piet Retief and one policeman got out of the car and went to buy some liquor as well as meat.  I think they bought about forty eight cans of beer.  At that time I had been made to lie flat on the back seat of the car and one policeman went across the street and went to taxi drivers and spoke to a certain person.  There was a White man as well as a Black person.  Then he came back and we followed that E20 or High Ace which had two occupants.  It proceeded to the Piet Retief Hospital.  They asked me about three places in Swaziland, Ngwenia Park, Two Sticks as well as Fairview.  These places are quite near the Manzini town and I was staying at Ngwenia Park.  They asked me about these three areas and asked whether I knew the whereabouts of ANC members who were staying around that area.  I told them that I had no knowledge thereof.  They said I thought I was like my father who thought that he was brilliant.  They proceeded to the Piet Retief Hospital.  They parked the car near a forest and started assaulting me severely and they made me lie flat on the ground.  One of the Boers from the E20 got into the car and reversed and just when he was about to land on me, they made him stop the car and said they should give me a chance to speak the truth and to tell them information about my father's involvement in politics.  I told them that I knew nothing.  They said they didn't believe that I was a student in Swaziland, there was something else that I was doing in Swaziland besides being a student.  They assaulted me even further at that point.  They did not believe anything that I was telling them.  They took me to the Kombi and took me to a certain scrap yard and said I should undress.  There were switches on the wall.  They pressed one switch and I saw a wire protruding from the wall.  They pressed another one and I saw a hole.  They said I must put my head in that hole and my neck was held in that hole.  They started assaulting me and electrocuting me.  I was naked at that time.  They got my head out of that hole.  They took a cutting torch and said I should stand just like Jesus when he was being crucified on the cross and they switched the cutting torch on and they burnt my chest.  At the time that they were burning my chest, one White man was strangling me with my own shirt and the other one was kicking me, others were hitting me and assaulting me further whilst the other one was burning me with this cutting torch.  They took me to the Piet Retief police station.  At about three o'clock on Sunday, they release me and said I should go back home.",

            "Bongani Mkhize, I'd like to thank you very much for coming.  You've told us of what happened to you.  The way in which you were brutally inhumanely beaten and tortured.  I think your story gives a very cruel twist to the old saying about the sins of the father being visited on the children but I mean your father will always be a hero of Mpumulanga .......  us to-day and to tell the story.  May I wish you strength in yourself and strength in your own life.  That is what we can wish you and the strong belief in yourself.  You come from a very proud tradition and we're very pleased that you could come.  Thank you very much.\nThank you.      \n Ladies and gentlemen before asking Reverend Kumalo to actually close our session here in Ermelo. I would just like to say thank you very much to you for having been here and I have some special words of thanks that I would like to say on behalf of those of us here on the panel and in the Commission.  \n As you can see there's a great deal of work that has gone in to making this session possible, these hearings possible.  In particular it is the people of Ermelo and the local authorities through  Mayor Madonsela who has made this possible.  I'd like to thank particularly the Mayor and his staff, the Town Clerk and the people who have helped set this up, the caterers, everybody else who has made this possible.  It's been a privilege for us to be here and we're very pleased that we have been able to be here.  \n The other people who you must realize, have actually made it possible too are our contacts on the ground who over the past months, not just weeks, over the past months have been working very very hard.  I think particularly of Reverend Nkosi.  Thank you very much Sir, for your help there.  I think particularly of Reverend Kumalo as well.  I think of the briefers whom we have seen to-day in their task and I think of the statement takers who helped.  All of them please we can't name everybody by name but thank you very much for that assistance.  \n Could I say a word there about statement taking.  This gives you some idea of what is possible through statements.  What we would appeal to is that other people come forward.  We have heard and we have a large number of statements but I think that what has been shown to-day where we've been talking quite specifically and we've been hearing quite specifically about a conflict.  A conflict which involves, if you like, two sides or possibly several protagonists, antagonists.  We have heard statements, we have heard testimony from people if you like, from only one side.  The work of the Commission is all-encompassing.  What we are trying to do by way of starting the process of Reconciliation is to bring out the stories of all people from all sides.  I think what we would appeal to very strongly, appeal to the community and appeal to everybody else from within this community and in a wide area, amongst all your contacts.  Whatever can be done to get more statements from more of the antagonists.  We need the full picture, we need the complete picture.  If it is possible and there's plenty of time still, there's not that much time but people do have some time to come forward and make statements and we would appeal to people to please come forward.  Let us have statements from the whole community not just the one part of the community.  \n I'd also in thanking people as well, like to mention a special word of thank to the SAPS, to Superintendent Beukman and his men and those who have been with us from Piet Retief as well and you will go on to Balfour with us, thank them for keeping us safe.  It's nice to be able work in that sort of  relationship now, isn't it.  I'd like to thank the media particularly for their assistance.  I'd like to thank the Commission staff, Truth and Reconciliation staff who also have made this possible.  Half of whom are now already in Balfour preparing for our hearing there to-morrow and as I said in the beginning I would like particularly to thank those of you who have been here to-day, who have sat so patiently and quietly and have listened.  I'm sure that you feel as enriched as we do by the experience of the hearing.  Finally, the most important people whom we have listened to to-day, the witnesses.  This has been their day.  They are the people whom we must thank from the bottom of our hearts.  Thank you very very much for your testimony, for coming forward in the way that you have.  Thank  you very much.  Now I'd ask Reverend Kumalo to say a few words and close this hearing in Ermelo.\nHearing closes with a hymn and a prayer.",
