Director, Director Steve Ngwenya who has very kindly said that he will come and give us an account.  He was a lawyer himself in Ermelo, practising.  He represented the Wesselton Action Committee at one stage.  He had bombs thrown into his office, two petrol bombs and he is now the Director of Land Government and Housing for Mpumulanga.  We're very grateful that he has come.  We're very grateful that he will give us some of the background to the questions that we have asked.  This will not be a sworn statement but  it's more by way of explaining for us, for the media what the background is to these stories that we are hearing.  Mr Ngwenya, could you come forward.  As I say, we won't swear you in because this will not be a statement in the normal sense but it will be explanatory.  If you would like, we can give you a briefer to sit by you but I don't think that we  - but we'd like to thank you very much for coming.  If you could press the red button .",

            "I understand that at one of the meetings of the Wesselton Action Committee this concern was raised and these particular individuals who are now committing crime under the name of structure which associated with the Action Committee had to be approached to be repremanded.  That's when the struggle started.  These so-called ...(indistinct) wouldn't accept that.  I believe that night or the following morning they then attacked all the leaders of the Wesselton Civic Association.  They were ................. Agenda's.  Whilst we thought we were carrying the crime, the violence, people had other agenda's.  So the violence continued.  People were attacked, killed.  People's houses were destroyed.\n And at that time, as you have indicated, Mr Chairman, I was acting on behalf of the Wesselton Action Committee and most of the people who supported that Committee.  Well I can tell, if an IFP member, a Black Cat member had committed a crime and there were eye witnesses and so on, that case will get nowhere.  It will either be, the docket has disappeared or the witnesses are not available or the charges will be withdrawn, if it ever reached court.   To an extent that at some stage I couldn't even believe what Prosecutors were doing themselves.  That's why unfortunately the discussions I had with some of the Prosecutors years later, they were so sorry for what they were doing because they trusted the police and didn't know that the police were fooling them.  \n Well as I've indicated cases against IFP members were mostly withdrawn or never reached court.  I also had to run around to try and defend most of the so-called Comrades who were arrested.  At that time I had a Secretary who was supposed to know my diary but I can tell you the police knew my diary better than me and better than my Secretary because if they arrested a person in Davel, they will tell that person that you won't see Ngwenya come to apply for bail for you because Ngwenya shall be busy in Carolina or Piet Retief that day.  They fabricated so many cases against the Comrades.  I'll say I was in court every day during that period, in three different courts every day finalizing cases.  I would say in all the cases that I did there I think only one percent of those people were convicted because all those cases were fabricated.  Now the torture which people suffered, the sad stories that you hear here, I've heard more than this because at that stage my office was just an extension of the Wesselton Action Committee office or the ANC office.  People were phoning me from their homes.  You'll hear old women crying, saying, Ngwenya here are the police beating my children, what are you doing there ?  People would run away from their houses to come and sit in my office there.   We kept on talking to the police but they didn't know what was happening so nobody knew what was happening.  \n ou know, at some stage my own office was bombed as you indicated and a guy who had been in detention at the police station came out of the police cells then straight to my office to tell me who burnt my office.  How it was organized by the police.  I took that guy one evening to go and make an afidavit with an Advocate in Johannesburg.  The house where I took him from that evening, that very same night the house was bombed and the lady that stayed with him died.  You know some of the things that I've heard from the people, it's hearsay and I must say that unfortunately some of the information I got was that relationship of Attorney and Client, so I will not be in a position to disclose names of people and some of the incidents but I can mention that one of the stories that I heard was that when these people were taken to Nlundi, they were found to be weak.  They were asked to go back to Wesselton to kill women, to come back with their private parts to be used as muti.  Those people who were in Nlundi were trained there in Nkuza and I believe some of them had to be trained with those that went to Caprivi Strip and so on.   \n  had the opportunity of listening to the first few guys who defected from the IFP who eventually went to the Commission to make their revelations.  Some of the horrible stories they told there have never been recollected up to now.  I don't know, I think I should stop there for now.",

It's so difficult, if you were there and you saw what happened to people but you were lucky you survived.

As I was crossing the street I came across three elderly men and they went past.  Thereafter I heard some gunfire and when I turned around I realized that I had been shot and they continued shooting me.  I ran into a neighbour's place where I hid myself in the toilet.  When I got there I threw up and I realized that I was losing my consciousness.  I went out of the toilet into the house and I went out of that yard.  That's where I lost consciousness.  I fell.  When I came to, I was being picked up by some youths who were putting me into a car and ferrying me to the hospital.  When I got to the hospital, I was sent to  Kalafong Hospital.

This issue of you were in the community, you heard some discussions about the Black Cats and  Comrades but you knew very little about them. Now as we travel throughout the country and people come to talk to the Truth Commission, to us, we often hear and particularly, and I don't want to sound as if I'm categorizing people into Black and White, particularly from members of the White community who say we never knew how bad things were.  Now, can you understand that yourself because here you are in a small community like Wesselton and I can only see as I drive past, in and out of Ermelo but it looks like a very small community, things are happening in your community.  People are dying, people are being shot at and often we hear that we didn't really know what was happening.  Can you understand that, the attitude that is coming through from the White community ?  They also did not understand what was happening.",

I think that there's two things that we need to say to you.  One is again to offer our support to see what we can do in chasing up your case as you asked specifically to find out about the disability grant and your possibility of getting that.  I think we must also call on the community to assist you.  To support you in bringing  yourself back into usefulness so that you don't feel too depressed, that you don't feel too down.  It's going to be difficult but it certainly is possible.  And we would like to issue an appeal to the community to assist you in that whether it's through the Church or whether it's through community support.  We would like to leave you with the challenge really which is very difficult but a challenge that you also make an effort to regain your strength and to carry on going and going well.  Thank you very much for coming.",
