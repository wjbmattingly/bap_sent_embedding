<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Phumzile I hope you are relaxed.  Please be relaxed.  Are you working Phumzile ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> Yes, I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> How's your family due ?  Where's the husband ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I do not have a husband.  We separated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You are separated.  Your children ?  Were there children ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I do have children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Who are at school ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Can you please tell us about, ...  are these your brothers Fanie and Dingani ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> They are my children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Are they your children, sorry Ma'am.  Okay.  Can you tell us how they met their fate ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> When I came back from work on the 14th of August in 1990 I received a telephone call.  Somebody was telling me that Fanie, my son, had been shot next to the shops.  He had been shot by a certain policeman by the name of Njomo.  When I went to the shops my sister came and we went to see him at the hospital and I asked him as to what had happened.  He told me that he had been shot by Njomo and asked what was happening.  He said he was with his uncle Steko and a Malindisa Booi and they harassed Malindisa Booi and when he intervened and asked, they did not answer him.  When they went away Njomo shot him from the back.  They sent him to Kalafong hospital.  That's where he was admitted.  He remained in Kalafong for the whole year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a> On the 4th of October 1990 when I was still at work, my cousin arrived together with my other son.  They'd come to fetch me from work and I asked them as to what had happened.  They said Dingane had been shot and admitted.  When I got to the hospital I found Dingane with his eyes closed.  He called out my name and I responded.  He said to me I should give him water and the sisters prohibited me from giving him water, the nursing sisters at the hospital.  I went outside and I stayed outside.  The following morning when we phoned Johannesburg hospital, they told me that Dingane died on the way to Johannesburg hospital.  Fanie stayed and he died in 1993 on the 16th of January.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a> Dingane was shot by Maschilwane, a CID.  I tried to get some legal advice.  I went to Prinsloo and he was going to institute civil action against Njomo but when my son died he said he could not continue with the legal proceedings because my son had died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Are you okay ? Are you ready to answer questions Sylvia ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I'm ready to answer questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You haven't told us what Prinsloo has to appear for ?  Which of your sons was it ? For Dingane or for Fanie ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> He said with regard to Fanie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Fanie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> He said with regard Dingane's matter he wouldn't be able to help us because he died at that time.  With Fanie's matter it was quite different because he took him to Pretoria in one of the Provincial Hospitals so that he could get a medical report as to his injuries and on the 2nd of February Prinsloo was supposed to go to finalise the matter and he died before the 2nd of February arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What did you get, what information did you get from the Malindi's family ?  Children or sons, who were with Fanie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> They said they were just asking as to what was happening.  Why were they harassing Mike Malindi so ?  That was all.  They did not fight but they tried to intervene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What has become of Njomo ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I don't know where Njomo is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Malindi does not even know about Njomo too ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I have no idea whether he knows where Njomo is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Was Njomo a policeman or Njomo was just an ordinary .....</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> Yes, he was a member of the South African Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> And how related, what was the relation between Fanie and the Malindi family ?  Were they students or were they just both youths in the township ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> Yes, they were friends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> And they couldn't  know who Njomo was or what the problem was between Njomo and Fanie ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I wouldn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Would you say that this kind of quarrel that could have been between Fanie and Njomo, had it any political content in it ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I have no idea but what I know is my son was a member of the ANC.  He was quite active within the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> He was a student at the time ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> He was working at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> He was working.  Was he part of the youth league or was he just a worker with Xhosa too, perhaps from that level having the relations with ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> It didn't occupy any particular position.  He was just an ordinary member.  I think a card carrying member of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Okay, it is true that Fanie died after a long period of illness but at his death, did the ANC, any ANC Constituency show sympathy or support to the family ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You have no idea what the youth at the time could have done that could brought that kind of anger of Njomo against them ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> It's maybe possible because at the time it wasn't quiet in our area.  There was some violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> And if I understand  you well, you are saying Fanie used to attend the meetings of those who were remotely or immediately involved in the violence of the day or in the confusions of the day ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> Fanie was not a thug.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> No, no, I'm not referring to a thug.  We said he was an active ANC member.  Now I'm saying perhaps organizations that were affiliated to ANC at that time could have been involved either in a quarrels or demonstrations against the community councillor or as it has been hinted earlier on.  You know, in organizing demonstrations.  This anti-rent meetings and so on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I wouldn't know whether Njomo bore a grudge because at that time he used to go out with Gita and Gita was an ANC member or an ANC supporter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Was that Njomo himself ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> Gita.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Njomo used to, sorry  Gita used go along with Fanie, or ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> Yes, Gita used to go along with Fanie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Okay.  And what story did Gita tell you ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> No, Gita was at work at this time.  We only met him at the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> With Dingane, what happened.  You say there was never a lawyer instructed to act on behalf of the family for Dingane's death ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> No, I never did.  No, there was nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> And was he a student, Dingane, or was he working too at the time ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> He was just  fresh from prison so he was not working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> And having come out of prison did he affiliate to any of the community organisations at the time ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> No, he was not involved in anything that took place in our area.  No political organisation or a gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> So, now you are left with how many children Sylvia ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> Three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Three.  These two were the eldest to those that are still with  you ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> Yes, they were.  Fanie was my first born and Dingane was my second borne.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Okay.  No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Thank you.  Any other questions ?  Doctor Ally ? Doctor Randera ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Mrs Vilakazi, I just want to follow up on what you said.  That the police were not interested in taking a statement from you.  Is that right ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> Yes, they didn't pay attention to what I was saying when I went to report the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> But did they take a statement ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> No, they didn't even want to write anything down when I reported it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> And when your  lawyer, Mr Prinsloo, approached the matter, what was said by the police ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> He never related to me as to what they told him but he told me that he was taking the matter further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Now, Fanie died almost five months later.  Is that right ?  Oh, sorry, two and a half years later.  Can you tell us what he died of ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> Ever since he was shot by Njomo, he was sickly and he had these sores that could not be cured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> So it was a direct complication of the shooting as far as you understand it ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> Yes, it was a direct complication because the bullets were not extracted from his body.  He remained with the bullets until he died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Can I just come to Dingane.  Dingane died the next day as you say in your statement, from the shooting.  Was there an inquest ?  Was a post- mortem done ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I was never told but they told me that he was dead on arrival.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> So you were just given a death certificate by the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I was never even given the death certificate.  They told me that he had been sent to Johannesburg and I phoned my brother to find out more and when we phoned the Johannesburg Hospital we were told that he was dead on arrival and we went to Mashilwane, the policeman who shot him and we asked him to fetch him from Johannesburg because we did not have money.  He asked me, if he was the one who was shot, would I have gone to fetch his corpse ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Thank you Ma'am, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Phumzile, thank you.  I'd just like to if I may to ask one or two questions myself.  You mentioned that Dingane was shot at his uncle's place just after he was released from detention.  Can you tell us how long he'd been in ... (interrupted) ... sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> At my uncle's place, not his uncle's place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Your uncle's place.  How long had he been in detention and why was he in detention ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I wouldn't know because I didn't even attend the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> But was he actually charged then, when he was taken into custody ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I don't know why he was arrested or what he was arrested for and what he was being charged for.  I decided that I was not going to attend the trial because I wanted to disassociate myself with any criminal acts committed by my children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> So you don't think that there was any political connection ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> No, I have no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Do you now how long he was in detention ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Mrs Vilakazi you story is, I mean, you have seen the death of your eldest son through both of them they've, I mean the paid and the suffering that you have had, particularly in Fanie's case where he came home and he was in a wheelchair as you described and didn't get better.   He went back to hospital, was then brought home again and died.  So this must have been two, two and a half very terrible years for you.   Then Dingane's death itself was so, it seems to be so senseless and so cruel that there he is sitting, he asks a question of someone who is in authority who takes out a gun and shoots him.  This must be, for a mother it must be a very dreadful thing to bear and we certainly are with you in that.  We will certainly follow up, through the lawyer that you have mentioned.  There's so many questions that your story raises and there must be questions that are with you all the time.  All I'd like to say is that we express our sympathy to you for that.  We hope that the community and the rest of your family will also stand with you and support you and we thank you very much for coming to-day.  Thank you.</p>
