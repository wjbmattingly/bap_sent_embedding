<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You are accompanied too.  Who is the person sitting with you by your side ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> I said she's my daughter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> She's your daughter.  What's her name ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> She has also come to testify with regard to what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What is her name ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> Tembi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Tembi. Tembi.  Mrs Mtsweni can you proceed to tell us about Boetie Mtetha Mtsweni who was beaten up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> Maki or Mateo is my son.  He was hacked to death by Inkatha members.  After they had done that ......  I was not at home at home at the time of the incident but my daughter, the one who is present here with me to-day was also present.  I was first from another place where I was told that my son had been taken to the Bethal Hospital.  They fetched me on a Monday and I went straight to the Bethal hospital.  When I got to Bethal Hospital they told me that he had just been taken to Kalafong Hospital and I proceeded home thereafter.  When I got there I was told of the injuries that he had sustained.  We do not have any clarity as to who attacked him but my daughter Tembi said certain policemen came into the house as well as an ambulance and they knocked at my place.  They woke them up and instructed them to open the door but they were scared to open up because at that time there was a lot of violence going on.  A certain policeman identified himself as Mandla Nglabati and he said he had come to tell them that my son had been injured.  They went out to speak to him  -  that he was wearing and he had just arrived on that particular day because he was from work.  He was working in Pretoria.  On that Monday I was at home and on Wednesday I went to Kalafong Hospital to see him.  I didn't know where Kalafong was but I had to look for it until I got there.  When I got to Kalafong I was not able to identify him because he was at the intensive care unit.  There were drips around him and the nursing sister pointed him out to me and he could identify me by my voice.  His eyes had been gouged out as well as his teeth, all his teeth.  He had no teeth left in his mouth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Relax Mama, really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> I stayed overnight at the Kalafong Hospital.  I was not able to leave my son behind in that condition and I slept on the bench at Kalafong hospital so that I could see him the following day.  The following morning I went to wash my face in the toilets, the hospital toilets and I went to see him once more.  I tried to speak to him.  One eye gouged out and he could hear my voice.  He knew I was his mother and I was told to go to Pretoria.  I got to Ogies and came back this way again.  After a few days a certain policeman by the name of  Gramel came to me and told me that I should go to court on a certain day.  I wanted to find out from Gramel as to who opened up a case or who submitted a  statement with regard to my son's injuries but he could not answer me.  I asked, who injured my son ?  He told me it was a certain man by the name of July Mtetwa and I asked him where July was.  He said July was out on bail, on five hundred rands bail.  I don't have a clear recollection of the time that he stayed at the hospital.   I think it was either one and a half months or two months.   When he came back he submitted a statement himself.  Even though he submitted a statement the matter went no further.  After about a year had lapsed, it's only then that the matter proceeded to court and we came to Ermelo.  I accompanied him to Ermelo and the matter proceeded.  We were addressed by the Regional Magistrate.  I think what he said that I can really testify to having heard, he asked my son as to how he identified the attacker.  My son said, I identified him because he had hit me twice at the back of my head and he turned around and he held him and the Magistrate asked as to whether there was any form of light that enabled him to identify his attacker.  He said there was some form of light.  It was not totally dark and he could identify him as July.  Thereafter others came and they also attacked him.  That's when he lost consciousness and he could not identify the rest but he knew about July.  When he came to he crawled to a certain woman's house who was staying in Davela and the woman who held my son.  He called the neighbours and the neighbours helped.  The Magistrate proceeded to tell him that he was not able to positively identify his attacker.   I don't know who the Magistrate knew it.  I think she'll proceed to say what happened thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Tembi, if you're going to testify could you please stand and take the oath.  If you could stand and swear that the testimony you'll give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God.  Raise your right hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">TEMBI  MTSWENI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Tembi, can you please tell us what you saw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> It was in the evening when my brother got attacked.  He crawled to another woman's place.  That's where he was helped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">TRANSLATOR:</span> The witness is not audible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Tembi, just take it easy and drink some water.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MTSWENI:</span> When they hacked him it was at night and he crawled to that woman's place.  There was a certain policeman by the name David Mathlango who went to report to the police station and the police came to pick him but the person who identified him as my brother was Mandla.  Mandla came to knock and report to us that my brother had been hacked.  When we opened up he said do said, Tembi do not run away because I've come to tell you that your brother has been injured.  I went to identify him when he was in the ambulance and when I looked at him his whole left side had been blown up.  Thereafter police came and told us that July had been arrested.  I asked them how they knew that July is the one that attacked my brother but they could not furnish me with a satisfactory answer.  When he came back his jaws were in wires and we asked what was happening.  They said they were trying to fix his left eye.  He asked us to close him or try to close his eye injuries.  When we got to the police station they pulled the wires out and he had to be re-admitted to the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> If I had to ask questions the first would be, where is  Boetie now ?  Are you still going on, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MTSWENI:</span> He has since died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> So, July was taken to court for injuring Boetie but after he died ... (interrupted)</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MTSWENI:</span> A year lapsed.  It's only after a year that the matter was dealt with in court and we attended the court case and the Magistrate asked us how my brother identified his attacker and the Magistrate said he was lying.  He was not able to identify his attacker.  That was the end of the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You say Mathews was working in Pretoria ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MTSWENI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Where was he working ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MTSWENI:</span> I'm not clear on that aspect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Nobody in the family knows ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MTSWENI:</span> He was working with Mr Blosser who's also in Pretoria.   Mr Blosser knows where my brother was working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You've got nothing from where he was working, after his death or even during his.... ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MTSWENI:</span> He just started work during that month that he was hacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Had he not worked anywhere before ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MISS MTSWENI:</span> Yes, he was working in Middelburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> It's very complicated.   Maybe we'll stop questioning any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Mrs Mtsweni, in your statement you seem to suggest that Mathews and July Mtetwa actually knew each other before this incident.  Is that correct ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Were they friends ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> No they were not friends but they knew each other because we were neighbours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> In you statement you also suggest that what caused them to become enemies was some dispute around a tavern.  Some tavern had been opened and soon after that they became enemies.  Can you just explain to us what you mean by that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> They were fighting because they were patrons of the tavern, both of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> But why were they fighting ?  Do you have any idea ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> I do not know why they were fighting but they once attacked him at some stage before they hacked him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Who's this they that you're referring to who attacked him ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> July together with his sister.  He was attacked for the first time then, then this incident was the second one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Now in your statement you also speak about this conflict we've been hearing about most of to-day.  The conflict between the ANC and the IFP.  You say there was a fight between IFP supporter s and ANC supporters.  This feud or dispute between your late son Mathews and July Ntetwa, how did this relate to this conflict, this fight between the ANC and the IFP which you speak about ?  Was there a link ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> July was a member of Inkatha and he was a police informer and all of us at my place were members of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Did your son, after the first attack, you say that he was attacked by July and July's sister, did he do anything about this ?  Did he report the matter or did he take any steps to protect himself ?  What happened after this first attack ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> No, we never laid a charge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Nothing.  Your son was attacked, according to your statement, that this took place in January of 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> And you say your son died in January of 1997.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> That's this year, this January.  So there's  six years that have passed.  In the certificate that you've also put in your statement, the cause of death here says natural causes.  What was it that caused the death of your son ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> I do not believe that it was a natural death.  He was always undergoing treatment and I think there's some substance that was coming out of his mouth.  I think this was a direct result of the attack by the Inkatha people six previous years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> In the attack you son lost his right eye.  That's correct ? After this attack he was blind in the one eye ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Did he recover sufficiently from this attack ?  Did he ever work again after that attack or ...?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MTSWENI:</span> No,  he never recovered thereafter.  He got sick and he was undergoing treatment for the past six years for his eyes as well as for the whole of his mouth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Dr Randera ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Ma'am Mtsweni and Tembi, it's very difficult to try and encompass what you have actually been through because you have both seen and suffered from the experiences of your son.  You have seen him through the effects of the attack.  You've seen him in hospital.  You've been through the court case where the person you think was responsible for the attack on him, is let free.  You've seen him being disabled and now more recently you've seen him die.  Again there's very little that we can do to lessen that.  What we can do is to try through the references that you have give, the case numbers, to see what can be done about possibly re-visiting the case or re-opening the case.  There is a report you talk about as well of a disability grant that is there and in offering our condolences and our sympathy I would just like to say that we will do what we can to follow this through.  It must be very difficult for you to have come to-day and we would like to say how grateful we are to you for that.  We share in you pain and give you what comfort we can through saying thank you very much for coming.  Thank you.</p>
